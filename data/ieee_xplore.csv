Farmers have to observe and determine whether a leaf was infected by naked eyes. This process is unreliable, inconsistent, and error prone. Several works on deep learning techniques for detecting leaf diseases had been proposed. Most of them built their models based on limited resolution images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this research, we aim at detecting early disease on plant leaves with small disease blobs, which can only be detected with higher resolution images, by an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. After a pre-processing step using a contrast enhancement method, all the infested blobs are segmented for the whole dataset. A list of several measurement-based features that represents the blobs are chosen and then selected based on their influences on the model's performance using a wrapper-based feature selection algorithm, which is built based on a hybrid metaheuristic. The chosen features are used as inputs for an ANN. We compare the results obtained using our methods with another approach using popular CNN models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet-50) enhanced with transfer learning. The ANN's results are better than those of CNNs using a simpler network structure (89.41% vs 78.64%, 79.92%, and 84.88%, respectively). This shows that our approach can be implemented on low-end devices such as smartphones, which will be of great assistance to farmers on the field.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3031914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229136","Neural network;image classification;plant disease;feature selection;precision agriculture","Diseases;Feature extraction;Training;Agriculture;Artificial neural networks;Plants (biology)","","189","","41","CCBYNCND","19 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps. A number of machine and deep learning algorithms were applied on the collected data wherein deep neural network with two hidden layers was found to be the most optimal model among all the selected models, providing an accuracy of (98.4%). Further, the health maps were validated through ground surveys and by agriculture experts due to the absence of reference data. The proposed research is basically an indigenous, technology based agriculture solution capable of providing important insights into the crop health by extracting complementary features from multi-modal data set, and minimizing the crop ground survey effort, particularly useful when the agriculture land is large in size.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3002948","Higher Education Commission (HEC), National Research Programme for Universities (NRPU) Program, Pakistan; Global Challenge Research Fund (GCRF), U.K; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119071","Internet of Things (IoT);precision agriculture;NDVI;crop health","Agriculture;Monitoring;Drones;Remote sensing;Indexes;Sensor systems","","107","","46","CCBY","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To accomplish this task, a farm robot should be able to accurately detect plants and to distinguish them between crop and weeds. Most of the promising state-of-the-art approaches make use of appearance-based models trained on large annotated datasets. Unfortunately, creating large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations is an extremely time consuming task, actually penalizing the usage of data-driven techniques. In this paper, we face this problem by proposing a novel and effective approach that aims to dramatically minimize the human intervention needed to train the detection and classification algorithms. The idea is to procedurally generate large synthetic training datasets randomizing the key features of the target environment (i.e., crop and weed species, type of soil, light conditions). More specifically, by tuning these model parameters, and exploiting a few real-world textures, it is possible to render a large amount of realistic views of an artificial agricultural scenario with no effort. The generated data can be directly used to train the model or to supplement real-world images. We validate the proposed methodology by using as testbed a modern deep learning based image segmentation architecture.

This paper presents a real-time computer vision-based crop/weed detection system for variable-rate agrochemical spraying. Weed/crop detection and classification were performed through the Random Forest classifier.

Most studies in the literature require the deployment of additional sensors for data collection. In this study, we propose to leverage available sensors built-in smartphones, to properly collect and broadcast data for different decision-making purposes in smart cities infrastructures, for example, intelligent transportation networks, smart health services, security and emergencies, industrial control, smart agriculture, home automation and so on. To this end, we first introduce our new platform (including software and mobile app implementation) to identify available sensors at each end-user device. We have identified a wide range of sensors including gyroscope, ambient light sensor, temperature, magnetic field sensor, orientation sensor, game rotation vector, linear acceleration, relative humidity, gravity, geomagnetic rotation vector, etc. As the sensors are already integrated within the phone, therefore, using these sensors can be beneficial considering the complexity, efficiency, and cost of the overall system. The challenge is to design a system that can trigger distributed devices to be self-activated and agreed to generate all available sensors data. Besides, as devices can send a continuous stream of data, therefore, size of data could be mounted and could be in the haphazard structure, which would give us hurdles to identify a device sensor data from another and to make an intelligent decision. To tackle all of these, we propose a distributed sensing approach that is capable to identify a device using token, can activate distributed end-user devices to send data to the cloud whenever it requires and store data in the cloud server maintaining proper format. This approach enables remote data collection leveraging available end-user devices and reduces the cost of installing new sensors for autonomous IoT applications. We then build on our efficient sensing platform to enable distributed intelligence among a network of smart devices. To this end, we leverage the computational capacity of these devices for local decision making, i.e., instead of broadcasting all sensing information to a centralized agent and solve a large-scale decision-making problem, each smart device communicates with a limited set of neighboring devices. This will also pave the way for implementing federated learning as a promising solution for distributed decision making.","","978-1-7281-5584-5","10.1109/CSCI49370.2019.00218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9071406","Internet of Things;autonomous decision making;federated learning;distributed algorithms;end-user devices;edge learning","Distributed databases;Intelligent sensors;Cloud computing;Sensor systems;Smart phones;Object recognition","","43","","25","IEEE","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We performed a review of the literature and found that blockchain performance, scalability, cost, and throughput are the major challenges in adopting blockchain for smart agriculture. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable and distributed data sharing system integrating access control for smart agriculture. We demonstrate our approach in a smart agriculture setting, which consists of four tiers that are: smart agriculture, smart contract, Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and agriculture stakeholders (remote users). This paper explains in detail the different components of our proposed architecture. Our approach uses anonymous identities to ensure users' privacy. Our approach is fully scalable because a large number of resource owners can use their data sharing smart contracts to create, update or delete data sharing policies. In addition, our approach does not require transaction fees when the smart contract receives a large number of policy evaluation requests. For the sake of simplicity, we publish and test a single data sharing smart contract. However, in practice, multiple smart contracts need to be deployed to allow each resource owner to securely share agriculture data with stakeholders. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed system on the EOS blockchain to show that the resource consumption (in terms of computing power and network bandwidth) introduced by our framework are insignificant compared to its scalability, cost and security benefits.","","978-1-7281-8420-3","10.1109/GCAIoT51063.2020.9345874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345874","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Smart Agriculture;Smart Farming;Data Sharing;Trust;Access Control;Scalability","Scalability;Smart contracts;Distributed databases;Blockchain;Agriculture;Internet of Things;Stakeholders","","42","","19","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to employ this emerging technology in fields such as high-throughput phenotyping and precision agriculture, direct georeferencing of hyperspectral data using onboard integrated global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) and inertial navigation systems (INSs) is required. Directly deriving the scanner position and orientation requires the spatial and rotational relationship between the coordinate systems of the GNSS/INS and hyperspectral scanner to be measured. The spatial offset (lever arm) between the scanner and GNSS/INS unit can be measured manually. However, the angular relationship (boresight angles) between the scanner and GNSS/INS coordinate systems, which is more critical for accurate generation of georeferenced products, is difficult to establish. This paper presents three calibration approaches to estimate the boresight angles relating hyperspectral push-broom scanner and GNSS/INS coordinate systems. For reliable/practical estimation of the boresight angles, this paper starts with establishing the optimal/minimal flight and control/tie point configuration through a bias impact analysis starting from the point positioning equation. Then, an approximate calibration procedure utilizing tie points in overlapping scenes is presented after making some assumptions about the flight trajectory and topography of covered terrain. Next, two rigorous approaches are introduced – one using ground control points and other using tie features. The approximate/rigorous approaches are based on enforcing the collinearity and coplanarity of the light rays connecting the perspective centers of the imaging scanner, object point, and the respective image points. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approaches, estimated boresight angles are used for orthorectification of six hyperspectral UAV dataset acquired over an agricultural field. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the results have shown significant improvement in the derived orthophotos to a level equivalent to the ground sampling distance of the used scanner (namely, 3–5 cm when flying at 60 m).","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2813263","Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy; U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-AR0000593); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8326499","Boresight calibration;direct georeferencing;hyperspectral imaging;integrated global navigation satellite system/inertial navigation system (GNSS/INS);push-broom scanner;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Calibration;Hyperspectral imaging;Sensors;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Satellites;Agriculture","","39","1","23","IEEE","27 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is because scintillation affects the tracking ability of GNSS receivers causing losses of lock and degradation on code pseudorange and carrier phase measurements, thus degrading accuracy. During strong ionospheric scintillation, such effects are more severe and GNSS users cannot rely on the integrity, reliability, and availability required for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach able to greatly reduce these effects of scintillation on precise point positioning (PPP). Our new approach consists of three steps: 1) a new functional model that corrects the effects of range errors in the observables; 2) a new stochastic model that uses these corrections to generate more accurate positioning; and 3) a new strategy to attenuate the effects of losses of lock and consequent ambiguities re-initializations that are caused by the need to re-initialize the tracking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an experiment using a 30-day static dataset affected by different levels of scintillation in the Brazilian southeastern region. Even with limitations imposed by data gaps, our results demonstrate improvements of up to 80% in the positioning accuracy. We show that, in the best cases, our method can completely negate the effects of ionospheric scintillation and can recover the original PPP accuracy that would have existed without any scintillation. The significance of this paper lies in the improvement it offers in the integrity, reliability, and availability of GNSS services and applications.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2903988","CIGALA(grant numbers:FP7-GALILEO-2009-GSA); CALIBRA(grant numbers:FP7-GALILEO-2011-GSA-1a); FAPESP(grant numbers:06/04008-2); National Institute of Science and Technology GNSS Technology to Support Air Navigation; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development process(grant numbers:465648/2014-2); Sao Paulo Research Foundation process(grant numbers:2017/01550-0); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel; Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Sao Paulo; CAPES(grant numbers:CAPES/PDSE n. 19-2016/Process 88881.134266/2016-01); CNPq(grant numbers:314043/2018-7); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663444","Ionospheric scintillation;mitigation;precise point positioning (PPP);scintillation-induced error","Receivers;Global navigation satellite system;Satellites;Phase locked loops;Phase measurement;Mathematical model;Standards","","37","","48","IEEE","8 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The early and accurate detection and classification of these diseases are fundamental for fostering healthy crop production. In recent years, smart agricultural systems have garnered significant attention due to their capability to enhance efficiency by deploying sensor networks and Internet of Things (IoT) devices that collect and analyze environmental data. However, traditional plant disease detection methods are manual, time-consuming, and often need help handling the data’s complexity and dynamism. These manual methods do not use heterogeneous data to make better decisions. Corn holds significant importance yet it faces numerous diseases that include main three diseases such as blight, common rust, and grey leaf spot. The advancement of computer technology has led to a pivotal focus on corn leaf diseases classification application based on deep learning. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revealed remarkable achievements within Precision Agriculture (PA) due to their ability to enhance information. To this end, this work introduces a CNN-based architecture, the Multi-Model Fusion Network (MMF-Net). Its primary objective is to classify diseases within the realm of PA. MMF-Net integrates multi-contextual features using RL-block and PL-blocks 1 & 2, thus effectively combining different model streams trained on heterogeneous data. The RL-block uses spatial range to process coarse grained images to convolve the local context, while PL-block 1 extracts fine-grained global context by expanding the perceptual area of images. PL-block 2 deals with real-life environmental parameters as features. The extracted features are syndicated using multiple classifiers that ensemble three individual blocks at the decision level to improve the accuracy. After fusion, it uses adaptively the majority voting scheme to generate the final decision probability score of the base model. Multiple experiments are conducted involving the corn leaf diseases dataset and a real-life numerical dataset, generating an impressive 99.23% accuracy in the classification of corn leaf diseases. Overall, MMF-Net provides a promising and smart solution to identify plant leaf diseases in PA effectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3357099","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers(grant numbers:PNURSP2024R387); Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10411914","Precision agriculture;corn disease;sensors;pest control;CNN;decision level fusion;multi-model;MULTI-context;AlexNet;VGG-16;ResNeXt;heterogeneous data","Diseases;Feature extraction;Crops;Data models;Visualization;Internet of Things;Deep learning;Precision agriculture;Smart agriculture;Plants (biology);Pest control;Heterogeneous networks","","36","","40","CCBYNCND","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study follows the footsteps of machine learning experts by introducing the state-of-the-art Yolov8 technology into the field of plant science. Moreover, we made some simple yet effective improvements. The integration of shallow-level information into the Path Aggregation Network (PANet) served to counterbalance the resolution loss stemming from the expanded receptive field. The enhancement of upsampled features was accomplished through combining the lightweight up-sampling operator Content-Aware ReAssembly of Features (CARAFE) with the Multi-Efficient Channel Attention (Mlt-ECA) technique to optimize the precision of upsampled features. This collective approach markedly amplified the discernment of small objects in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images, naming it Yolov8-UAV. Our evaluation is based on datasets containing four different plant species. Experimental results demonstrate the strong competitiveness of our proposed method even when compared to the most advanced counting techniques, and it possesses sufficient robustness. In order to advance the cross-disciplinary research of computer vision and plant science, we also release a new cotton boll dataset with detailed annotated bounding box information. What’s more, we address previous oversights in existing wheat ear datasets by providing updated labels consistent with global research advancements. Overall, this research offers practitioners a powerful solution for addressing real-world application challenges. For UAV scenarios, recommend using the specialized Yolov8-UAV, while Yolov8-N is a wise choice for general scenes due to its sufficient accuracy and speed in the majority of cases. Furthermore, we contribute two meaningful datasets that have research significance, effectively promoting the application of data resources in the field of plant science. In short, our contribution is to improve the use of Yolov8 in UAV scenarios and open two datasets with bounding boxes.

Through the thoughtful utilization of modern computer vision techniques, it is possible to achieve positive financial and environmental results for these tasks. This work introduces an automation framework that attempts to address the three main drawbacks of existing approaches: 1) lack of generality (methods are tuned for specific data sets); 2) difficulty to apply in variable field conditions; and 3) lack of tool sophistication that limits their applicability. The cultivation of corn lies in the core of the American and global economy with 81.7 million acres harvested only in the USA for the year 2018. The ubiquity of its cultivation makes it an ideal candidate to highlight the large economic benefits from even a small improvement in nutrient deficiency detection. The proposed methodology utilizes drone collected images to detect nitrogen (N) deficiencies in maize fields and assess their severity using low-cost RGB sensors. The proposed methodology is twofold. A low complexity recommendation scheme identifies candidate plants exhibiting N deficiency and, with minimal interaction, assists the annotator in the creation of a training data set that is then used to train an object detection deep neural network. Results on data from experimental fields support the merits of the proposed methodology with mean average precision for the detection of N-deficient leaves reaching 82.3%. Note to Practitioners—The motivation behind this article is the problem of inefficient fertilizer application in corn fields throughout the cultivation season. Current widely spread techniques to counter plant malnutrition suggest the application of excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer prior to seeding or the uniform application during the plant growth. These practices result in financial losses and have severe environmental consequences, e.g., the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. We propose an automation framework that automatically detects corn nitrogen deficiencies in the field during the plants’ growth, and to achieve our goal, we employ low-cost robotic platforms and RGB sensors. The framework that we developed is able to detect the characteristic pattern of nitrogen deficiency on corn leaves and provide an estimation of the in-field spatial variability of the deficiency.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2020.3022868","Corn Growers Association of MN; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1432957,CNS-1531330,CNS-1939033); U.S. Department of Agriculture/National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA/NIFA)(grant numbers:2020-67021-30755); University of Minnesota Informatics Institute (UMII) Fellowship and the University of Minnesota Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship (UMN DDF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216563","Automation in agriculture;nitrogen deficiency;plant deficiency;precision agriculture (PA);remote sensing (RS)","Nitrogen;Fertilizers;Sensors;Automation;Agriculture;Remote sensing","","30","","46","IEEE","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wheat, a staple crop worldwide, requires accurate and prompt prediction of its output for global food security. Traditionally, the development of empirical models for crop yield forecasting has relied on climate data, satellite data, or a combination of both. Despite the enhanced performance achieved by integrating satellite and climate data, the contributions from various sources (Climate, Soil, Socioeconomic, and Remote sensing) remain unclear. The lack of well-defined comparisons between the performance of regression-based approaches and different Machine Learning (ML) methods in yield prediction necessitates further investigation. This study addresses the gaps by combining data from multiple sources to forecast wheat yield in the Multan region in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The findings are compared to the benchmark provided by Crop Report Services (CRS) Punjab, with three widely used ML techniques (support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)) by integrating publicly available data within the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform, including climate, satellite, soil properties, and spatial information data to develop alternative empirical models for yield prediction using data from 2017 to 2022, selecting the best attribute subset related to crop output. The district-level simulated yield data set was analyzed with three ML models (SVM, RF, and LASSO) as a function of seasonal weather, satellite, and soil. The results indicate that combining all datasets using three ML algorithms achieves better yield prediction performance ( $R^{2}$ : 0.74-0.88). Incorporating spatial information and other properties into benchmark models can improve the prediction from 0.08 to 0.12. Random forest outperformed the competitor models with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.05 q/ha and  $R^{2}$  of 0.88. Comparative analysis shows that random forest with 97% and SVM with 93% yielded better results in the study area.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3376735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10471549","Machine learning;RF;LASSO;remote sensing;SVM;CNN;crop yield prediction","Climate change;Machine learning;Remote sensing;Crop yield;Agriculture;Precision agriculture;Forecasting;Predictive models;Regression analysis;Benchmark testing;Satellite images;Support vector machines;Random forests;Weather forecasting;Spatial databases;Data integration","","28","","58","CCBYNCND","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The past two decades have witnessed the increased intensity of agricultural production risks due to challenges posed by climate changes. There is a dire need to address it with proper insights into the data attributes impacting the crop yield. Currently, many of the machine learning and deep learning methods focus on training the model using the data collected and stored in a centralized data repository. However, many attributes related to weather data, soil data and crop management data are scattered and siloed to particular organization servers or smart farming devices. In this study, we are proposing a federated learning method for training yield prediction models on a horizontally distributed dataset located on different client devices. In particular, federated averaging algorithm is used to train the deep residual network based regression models such as ResNet-16 and ResNet-28 for soybean yield prediction in a decentralized setting and compare its performance with deep learning and machine learning methods. The results from experimented learning models show that federated averaging using ResNet-16 regression model with Adam optimizer yielded optimal results compared to centralized learning models and can be easily deployed for yield prediction in a federated setting.","","978-1-6654-5883-2","10.1109/DELCON54057.2022.9752836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9752836","Agricultural Production Risk Management;Deep Learning;Federated Learning;Federated Averaging;Machine Learning;Soybean Yield Prediction","Training;Deep learning;Sociology;Crops;Climate change;Predictive models;Soil measurements","","25","","31","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result of analyzing the energy demands for heating in pigsty based on the digital twin framework, the fan-coil unit was found to be the most energy efficient.

Traditionally, crop diseases are identified by visual inspection and based on the experience of farmers and agricultural experts, a method that not only consumes human resources but also has a certain degree of subjectivity and inaccuracy. The development of artificial intelligence technology successfully achieves real-time monitoring, automatic identification, and intelligent decision by combining the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and cloud computing technology. Herein, we proposed an EfficientNet Convolutional Group-Wise Transformer (EGWT) architecture. The local features of crop leaf images are extracted by EfficientNet convolution and then input into a group-wise transformer architecture. In the group-wise transformer process, the input features are divided into multiple groups. An attention mechanism is used within each group to calculate correlations between features. After calculating the intra-group attention, the output features of each group are stitched together to form the final output features. Our proposed model achieves 99.8% accuracy on the PlantVillage dataset, 86.9% accuracy on the cassava dataset, and 99.4% accuracy on the Tomato leaves dataset, with the least number of parameters 23.04M in the state-of-the-art convolutional combinatorial transformer hybrid model.

Many methods are proposed in the literature for plant disease detection using optical sensors mounted on agricultural robots. There are many deep learning algorithms proposed to identify plant diseases. Many such algorithms require high computation power and take more time during training. Implementation of such algorithms on robot controllers for online detection is quite difficult. In this paper, we propose the use of lighter versions of YOLO which are more efficient and have high detection speed in plant disease detection. A case study of deadly viral disease that affects Papaya plants is considered, and a dataset consisting of images of both healthy and diseased leaves which are affected by the Papaya ringspot virus has been constructed. The proposed algorithms have been trained on the dataset built and tested. Test results show that lighter versions of YOLO are far more efficient than improved or original versions of YOLO, especially in the case of plant disease detection using mobile agricultural robots.","","978-1-6654-4368-5","10.1109/ICIVC52351.2021.9526944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9526944","deep learning;plant disease detection;papaya ringspot virus;model training","Training;Deep learning;Productivity;Agricultural robots;Plants (biology);Robot sensing systems;Unmanned aerial vehicles","","20","","24","IEEE","14 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper first introduces the evolution of GIS technology. As the third generation language of geography, GIS is a comprehensive application system developed in the last 50 years. Internationally, GIS began to be used in agriculture in the 1970s. It has been applied in land resource survey, land resource evaluation, and management analysis of agricultural resource information. After the 1990s, the application of GIS in the field of agriculture has been deepened and popularized. It is mainly used in the followings, such as the regional agricultural sustainable development research, land crop suitability evaluation, agricultural production information management, farmland soil erosion and protection research, land agricultural productive potential research, agricultural system imitation and simulation research, integrated of modern high-tech “precision agriculture” research and application, agro-ecosystem monitoring and quantitative research, investigation, planning and management of farmland and agricultural input-output benefits and environmental protection research, forest pest control, etc. In China, in the mid-1980s, GIS began to be applied to the agricultural field including land and resources decision management, agricultural resource information, regional agricultural planning, grain distribution management and food production assisted decision-making, agricultural production potential research, crop yield estimation research, regional agricultural sustainable development research, agricultural land suitability evaluation, agro-ecological environment monitoring, and research on precision agricultural information processing systems based on GPS and GIS, which have made great achievements. Some research results have been directly applied to agricultural production and great economic benefits have been obtained. This paper focuses on the specific application research of GIS technology on agricultural resource information management, agroclimatic zoning, agricultural disaster prevention, agro-ecological environment management, precision agriculture, crop yield estimation and monitoring, soil erosion, ecological sensitivity and non-point source pollution, etc. The research believes that the application of “3S” integration technology, the integration of integrated agricultural expert system (ES) combined with GIS, and the application of portable mobile GIS are the main trend of modern agriculture development of GIS technology under the background of today's informatization and networking.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820476","geographic information system;agriculture;agriculture climatic zoning;agricultural disaster prevention;precision agriculture;application;research progress","Geographic information systems;Agriculture;Production;Soil;Spatial databases;Planning;Decision making","","19","","14","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent advances in IoT hardware, e.g., networks of heterogeneous embedded devices, and software, e.g., lightweight computer vision algorithms and cloud optimization solutions, make it possible to efficiently process data from diverse sources in a connected (smart) farm. By interconnecting these IoT devices, often across large geographical distances, it is possible to collect data at different time scales, including in near real-time (i.e., with delays of only a few tens of seconds). This data can then be used for actionable insights, e.g., precise applications of soil supplements and reduced environmental footprint. Through LATTICE, we present an integrated vision for IoT solutions, data processing, and actionable analytics for digital agriculture. We couple this with discussion of economics and policy considerations that will underlie adoption of such IoT and ML technologies.

Despite monumental advances in autonomous robotic technologies for precision weed management in recent years, work on under-canopy weeding in fields is yet to be realized. A prerequisite of such systems is reliable detection and classification of weeds to avoid mistakenly spraying and, thus, damaging the surrounding plants. Real-time multi-class weed identification enables species-specific treatment of weeds and significantly reduces the amount of herbicide use. Here, our first contribution is the first adequately large realistic image dataset AIWeeds (one/multiple kinds of weeds in one image), a library of about 10,000 annotated images of flax and the 14 most common weeds in fields and gardens taken from 20 different locations in North Dakota, California, and Central China. Second, we provide a full pipeline from model training with maximum efficiency to deploying the TensorRT-optimized model onto a single board computer. Based on AIWeeds and the pipeline, we present a baseline for classification performance using five benchmark CNN models. Among them, MobileNetV2, with both the shortest inference time and lowest memory consumption, is the qualified candidate for real-time applications. Finally, we deploy MobileNetV2 onto our own compact autonomous robot SAMBot for real-time weed detection. The 90% test accuracy realized in previously unseen scenes in flax fields (with a row spacing of 0.2-0.3 m), with crops and weeds, distortion, blur, and shadows, is a milestone towards precision weed control in the real world.

The compressed data set is used to create a rank generator to specify the most suitable five crops for a particular location and also provide the ranking for important crops in that region. Also, validated this recommended suitable crops with currently used crops and observed that 77.18% of farmers are using the crops that are suitable for their soil but the rest of them are not focused on their soil nutrient status and suitable crops.","","978-1-7281-4685-0","10.1109/ICICT48043.2020.9112562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9112562","data mining;geospatial data;precision agriculture;DBSCAN;rank-based crop recommendation","Precision agriculture;Noise;Crops;Soil;Nutrients;Geospatial analysis;Sensors;Data mining;Recommender systems;Global Positioning System","","16","","33","IEEE","9 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Efficient use of Earth's natural resources is the only solution to facing future challenges such as global hunger. The implementation of precision agriculture using new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, IoT and remote sensing is the first step towards this goal. In this paper, we investigated several machine learning models to create two services: one for recommending the best crop to grow based on soil and the region's weather characteristics, and another for the forecasting of the hourly average air temperature. Performance evaluation results for the first service show that Random Forest has the best metrics as a classifier (accuracy = 100%, precision = 100%, recall = 100%) compared to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, and Feed Forward Neural Network. This is a confirmation that classic machine learning algorithms perform better on small-size datasets. In our case, we used a dataset of 2200 instances available online. On the other hand, Facebook Prophet was more accurate (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 3.74) than our proposed LSTM architecture in time series forecasting at hourly scale using historical weather data provided by the weather station of our study area.

By constructing a smart shed environment with real-time measurement of moisture content, temperature, and humidity from the air through smart IoT devices with sensors, the automated model recommends a way for protecting plant life and demonstrating an efficient lengthier growth outcome.

Central to these problems is that LAC is the most economically unequal region globally. Thus, it faces unique challenges in promoting sustainable development.

One effective way to automate soil prediction is image processing techniques in which soil images may be analyzed to determine the soil. This paper presents an efficient image analysis technique to predict the soil. For the same, a robust feature selection technique has been incorporated in the image analysis of soil images. The developed feature selection technique uses a new oscillating spider monkey optimization algorithm (OSMO) for the selection of features that are relevant and non-redundant. The new oscillating spider monkey optimization algorithm increases precision and convergence behavior by using an oscillating perturbation rate. A set of standard benchmark functions was deployed to visualize the performance of the new optimization technique (OSMO), and results were compared based on mean and standard deviation.

However, citrus leaf scab illnesses brought on by the pathogenic fungus Elsino fawcettii remain a constant danger to the thriving citrus sector. Preventing crop losses and ensuring sustainable citrus output depends on early and precise identification of these diseases. The proposed study combines the accuracy of convolutional neural networks (CNN) with the transparency of decision tree (DT) to solve the problem of citrus leaf scab classification. The current work amassed a massive dataset of 50000 high-resolution photos of citrus leaves with varying degrees of citrus leaf scab disease to use in the analysis. Expert plant pathologists painstakingly labeled the dataset and split it into training, validation, and testing groups. Preprocessing methods were used to normalize the data and increase the size of the training set. Along with this, it presents a hybrid model that uses a CNN to analyze and make transparent decisions based on the pictures of citrus leaves. The model was trained and tested to determine how well it could classify citrus leaf scab samples into many categories. The total accuracy of the proposed approach in diagnosing the severity of citrus leaf scab illnesses was 98.07%. The accuracy and the capacity to manage unbalanced classes were further confirmed by the precision, specificity, and F-measure for each acuteness level (ACL). The suggested study contributes to the field of precision agriculture by suggesting an accurate and mechanised method for identifying citrus leaf scab.

The photogrammetry method relies heavily on the accuracy of the UAV positioning parameters, however, the construction and use of high-precision positioning equipment are expensive and difficult to be widely used. The method based on image matching requires good similarity between matching images, which is hard to be satisfied as the reference image and UAV image are heterologous. The existing methods are difficult to achieve accurate image geo-location on UAVs equipped with economical positioning devices. To address this issue, we propose a coarse-to-fine UAV image geo-localization pipeline. Firstly, we implement the coarse UAV image geo-localization by utilizing the UAV's position parameters. Then, a deep learning algorithm multi-stage Lucas-Kanade (MS-LK) is proposed to refine the UAV image geo-localization results iteratively. MS-LK can make full use of the UAV images' global texture. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two real UAV data sets. The results show that the proposed UAV image geo-localization method can promote the results of the traditional photogrammetry-based approaches.","","978-1-6654-0474-7","10.1109/ICTC51749.2021.9441503","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9441503","UAV image geo-localization;deep learning;MS-LK (multi-stage Lucas-Kanade) network;coarse-to-fine","Deep learning;Learning systems;Image sensors;Satellites;Image matching;Pipelines;Unmanned aerial vehicles","","9","","16","IEEE","31 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Agricultural segmentation targets are generally small in size and heavily obstructed. At the same time, image segmentation in agricultural scenes has strong application scenarios, such as blooming intensity estimation, which refers to the estimation of the density and intensity of blooms, fruit yield estimation, fruit harvesting positioning, and so on. Currently, CNNs dominate semantic segmentation of agricultural scenes due to the significant computational constraints of using the Transformer module. However, CNNs have several disadvantages, such as limited effective receptive fields and the inability to capture global information, which significantly reduce their segmentation accuracy in complex agricultural scenes. In addition, the simple upsampling process used in CNNs can result in blurred segmentation edges and inferior performance. This paper presents a new semantic segmentation algorithm based on SegFormer: PD-SegNet(Powerful Decoder SegFormer Network), which balances accuracy and computational efficiency and combines dynamic kernel self-renewal with edge-aware optimization. The proposed algorithm demonstrates outstanding performance in two typical agricultural scenarios: apple blossom and apple fruit segmentation detection and sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the MinneApple Apple segmentation dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline method in the segmentation of complex small targets. This algorithm can optimize the semantics segmentation of small targets in complex scenes and contributes to the development of smart agriculture.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3284036","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFD2001404); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10146268","Smart agriculture;deep learning;semantic segmentation;object detection;transformer;dynamic kernel;image edge optimization","Semantic segmentation;Feature extraction;Transformers;Smart agriculture;Decoding;Task analysis;Semantics;Kernel","","9","","44","CCBYNCND","8 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has resulted in the need for automation in plant health identification. However, this objective is hampered by the lack of efficient image-processing methods and the need for extensive datasets for training deep learning models for plant disease diagnosis. To overcome the need for extensive training data, the proposed Localized Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (LNDVI) uses zero-shot plant detection models such as Grounded Dino and state-of-the-art methods for image segmentation such as Segment Anything Model (SAM) are leveraged. This also expands the capabilities of the system to diagnose plant health beyond known plant species available as part of training set. The proposed system uses synthetic Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate the chlorophyll content of the plant through RGB images alone instead of using the combination of RGB and near Infra-red (nIR) bands used in contemporary works. Since NDVI value is greatly affected by the amount of light present while the image is captured, we also present an irradiation estimation metric that uses CIE XYZ (Tristimulus values), Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) and CIE LAB color spaces as well as correlated color temperatures, which automatically normalizes the NDVI threshold for health classification of the image, enabling a more precise analysis of plant health. Using the Grounding Dino provided an accuracy of 99.994% in terms of detecting plants from the phenotyping dataset. The segmentation of plant region in images is reported using Intersection over Union (IoU). While using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), an average accuracy of 95.884% was obtained for clustered plants while the average accuracy was even better at 97.031% for individual plants.

Inappropriate farming conditions can lead to poor production output. It is necessary to measure, understand, and control farm conditions precisely in order to predict the performance of farming.

The main goal of utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for plant leaf disease detection is to precisely categorize images of plant leaves into categories of healthy or diseased. Depending on the particular application scenario, there could be additional goals that researchers try to accomplish with their CNN models in addition to this main one. Tomato is a widely cultivated vegetable and is an important food crop worldwide. Employing machine learning and image processing methods for detecting diseases in tomato plant leaves can be highly efficient. These techniques can be used to analyze images of tomato leaves taken in the field, and an accurate algorithm can be used to identify the presence of disease symptoms. One such approach is using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) algorithm which have been trained on a dataset of images of tomato leaves with and without disease symptoms. This can be done by gathering the images of the healthy tomato leaves and the infected ones and then training a CNN model to detect the difference.

Primary sources of those indexes are satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with expensive multispectral sensors. Reducing the price of obtaining such information would increase the availability of precision farming. Several studies have proposed deep neural network methods to estimate the indexes from RGB color images. However, these studies report relatively large errors for mature plants, when highly non-linear relationships between image RGB bands and vegetation indexes arise. One could apply multilayer random forest-based models (Deep Forests) to solve this problem, but they have limited discriminative power and ability on catching non-linear relationships between image features. The cornerstone of the Deep Forests is that at each layer they enrich original features with embeddings containing empiric class probabilities from previous layers, although these probabilities deliver limited information. In this paper, we propose methods, which combine ideas of Deep Forests, Random Forests of multivariate trees, and global pruning of Random Forests to tackle these problems. We applied oblique (linear) and kernel (non-linear) trees as basic classifiers of the Deep Forest to improve discriminative power. We also utilized a method to refine Random Forests with a global loss optimization. This method helps to generate more expressive embeddings at each layer of the Deep Forest, which significantly improves results of the data analysis. In the experiments, we compared those methods with AlexNet and ResNet-based neural networks on several image classification datasets as well as on the NDVI prediction task. The experiments on image classification show that the proposed Deep Forest-based methods provide competitive results on datasets with small and medium size of feature-set. The results of the NDVI prediction task indicate that these methods are robust to senescence of plants and outperform neural network-based solutions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3261129","Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation(grant numbers:075-15-2020-805); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10078876","Random forests;deep forest;oblique trees;multivariate trees;forest refinement;NDVI;RGB images","Random forests;Deep learning;Regression analysis;Indexes;Vegetation mapping;Neural networks","","8","","41","CCBYNCND","23 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing single-sequence learning frameworks are difficult to accurately and adequately capture contextual information, leaving a large proportion of outliers between two low-overlap scenes. In this article, we present a progressive guidance network (PG-Net) to gather rich contextual information and exclude outliers. Specifically, we design a novel iterative structure that exploits the inlier probabilities of correspondences to guide the classification of initial correspondences progressively. This structure can mitigate outlier effects with robust contextual information to obtain more accurate model estimation. In addition, to sufficiently capture contextual information, we propose a grouped dense fusion attention (GDFA) feature embedding module to enhance the representation of inliers and significant channel–spatial. Meanwhile, we propose a two-stage neural spectral matching (TSNSM) module to compute the inlier probability of each correspondence and estimate a 3-D transformation model in a coarse-to-fine manner.

These attributes, described in detail in the dataset’s metadata, provide the foundational information required for precise irrigation management. The system operates seamlessly by deploying IoT sensors to collect real-time data from the field. This data is then preprocessed to ensure its quality and consistency. Subsequently, a machine learning model is trained using this dataset to make intelligent irrigation decisions in real time. The model’s predictions are seamlessly integrated with control mechanisms that govern the irrigation process. Moreover, the system offers an intuitive API for easy data access and management, allowing agricultural professionals to monitor and adjust irrigation strategies effortlessly.

In this work, we have proposed an advanced “Crop Recommendation System” to help farmers choose the right crop according to different soil and environmental parameters. Our system is trying to improve crop yields and agricultural productivity using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. The data used for training and evaluation was collected from the Kaggle dataset repository. It includes the eight most important features such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), rainfall, pH, temperature, humidity, and crop labels representing 22 different crops. This work employs machine learning and deep learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, and Temporal Convolutional Networks. Based on performance evaluation, Random Forest and TCN are the best models, showing 99.2% and 99.9% accuracy, respectively. The performance of other models was also excellent, with accuracy levels ranging from 93.8% to 98.7%. SVM was a little behind, but still performed well with 93.4% accuracy. The project also includes parameter optimization for XGBoost and TCN. The TCN model gives a better result than XGBoost using parameter optimization. The outcome of this research shows that machine learning and deep learning models perform well in crop recommendation systems and the TCN model demonstrates its commitment to accurate and efficient crop recommendations.

The study presents a new categorization scheme for leaf diseases that uses four severity levels based on the distribution of a dataset through 4 different clients. It aimed to exploit the decentralized nature of FL to improve data privacy while benefiting from powerful image classification potentials offered by CNNs. Two of the four clients in our study, fq1 to fq4, provided local data combined via Federated Averaging into a global model. The result analysis applied three key metrics: macro, micro, and weighted averages that portray the model's local and international performance. The results from every client indicated a steady increase in classification accuracy. The Macro Average at approximately even treatment of all the classes increased steadily from fq_1 (96.35%) until fq_4 (99.11%). Similarly, the Weighted Average that considers class representation began at 96.45% for f q_1 and ended at 99.10 % table for fq_4.

Therefore, this work aims at developing a system to identify the type of disease that affects the tomato leaves at an early stage.

To improve the diagnostic accuracy of disease detection system, fusion of two different texture features is performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). A publicly available tomato leaves dataset is used to evaluate the proposed system. A considerable improvement in relevant performance metrics is observed in CCA based feature fusion.

In agriculture field, factors such as soil quality, weather patterns, and crop yields are essential components of usual possessions that affect farming manufacture. Despite advancements, prevailing smart systems quiet struggle with handling big amounts in prediction claims, often facing difficulties in balancing prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. To ensure sustainable food production, integrating advanced machineries such as machine learning and artificial intelligence in agriculture is essential. This study proposes an explainable AI (XAI)-based smart agriculture system to provide holistic recommendation for precision farming aimed at improving productivity while reducing environmental impact. We compiled a comprehensive weather, soil, and crop dataset from official and verified sources in India. From this dataset, we extracted and optimized features using pre-trained architectures and enhanced barnacles mating optimization (EBMO) algorithm, addressing the high-measure mentality and computational complexity issues often encountered in agricultural data analysis. The selected features were analyzed to provide holistic recommendations for precision farming using baseline ML models such as support vector machine, random forest, neural network, and decision tree. Additionally, we integrate the XAI framework with an interpretable recommendation/s for optimizing the agricultural practices. The study developed an XAI-based smart agriculture system that provides holistic recommendations for precision farming to boost productivity. By using a comprehensive dataset and optimizing features with the EBMO algorithm, the research achieved high accuracy in crop yield predictions, particularly with the XLNet+SVM model, which outperformed existing models across various crops. The integration of SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) further enabled interpretable AI-driven insights, enhancing transparency in decision-making. The results demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy, resource management, and sustainability, offering valuable contributions to global food security through smart agriculture.

To optimize resource utilization and minimize crop losses, farmers are joining cooperatives to share their data and resources among member farms. However, while farmers benefit from this data sharing and interconnection, it exposes them to cybersecurity threats and privacy concerns. A cyberattack on one farm can have widespread consequences, affecting the targeted farm as well as all member farms within a cooperative. For instance, a de-authentication attack prevents sensors from connecting to the network, obstructing the farming application from receiving real-time data. This disruption obstructs decision-making for all member farms that rely on this data from an attacked farm. Further, farmers have adopted digital twin (DT) technology that facilitates a virtual farm replica that encompasses vital aspects of farming, such as crop cultivation, soil composition and weather conditions. However, it’s critical to acknowledge that attackers can target these digital twins (DTs), potentially disrupting real physical farm operations.In this research, we address existing gaps by proposing a novel and secure architecture for Cooperative Smart Farming (CSF). First, we highlight the role of edge-based DTs in enhancing the efficiency and resilience of agricultural operations. To validate this, we develop a test environment for CSF, implementing various cyberattacks on both the DTs and their physical counterparts using different attack vectors. We collect two smart farming network datasets to identify potential threats. After identifying these threats, we focus on preventing the transmission of malicious data from compromised farms to the central cloud server. To achieve this, we propose a CNN-Transformer-based network anomaly detection model, specifically designed for deployment at the edge. As a proof of concept, we implement this model and evaluate its performance by varying the number of encoder layers. Additionally, we apply Post-Quantization to compress the model and demonstrate the impact of compression on its performance in edge environments. Finally, we compare the model’s performance with traditional machine learning approaches to assess its overall effectiveness.","2573-2978","979-8-3503-6248-0","10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10825128","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10825128","Cooperative Smart Farming (CSF);Security;Attacks;Digital Twin (DT);Azure Digital Twin;Amazon Web Services (AWS);CNN;ML algorithms","Smart agriculture;Web services;Image edge detection;Crops;Soil;Vectors;Digital twins;Servers;Cyberattack;Farming","","5","","36","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a gap between current food productivity growth and needed growth. To boost the yield, farmers switched to extensive use of chemical fertilizers. Excessive fertilizer usage has its negative impact like decreased yield, wastage of fertilizer, damage to soil, and groundwater contamination. Currently, farmers mostly rely on guesswork, estimation, experience when deciding the crop that should grow, and the fertilizer that should be used.

The main aim is to detect the disease in the leaf at an early stage and thus take suitable measures to stop this disease. Features are then extracted from the processed image for classification using tensorflow object detection model. The farmer after uploading an image can click on the predict option which first previews the uploaded image and then predicts the disease type of the crop and outputs the details of disease type, description of the disease, symptoms and the treatment or required amount of fertilization for the diseased leaf.

Accurate field boundaries enable farm machinery contractors and other farm stakeholders to calculate charges, costs and to examine machinery performance. Field segmentation is the process by which agricultural field plots are geofenced into their individual field geometric boundaries. This paper presents a novel coordinate-based method to perform trajectory segmentation and field boundary detection from a tractor towing an implement. The main contribution of this research is a practical, robust algorithm which can solve for challenging field-to-field segmentation cases where the operator engages the towed implement continuously across several fields. The algorithm first isolates raw machinery trajectory data into unique job sites by using a coarse filter on geolocation data and implement power-take off activation. Next, the coordinate data is plotted and image processing techniques are applied to erode any pathway(s) that may present in job sites with adjacent working fields. Georeferenced time series tractor and implement data were aggregated from a five-month-long measurement campaign of a silage baling season in Galway, Ireland. The algorithm was validated against two unique machinery implement datasets, which combined, contain a mixture of 296 road-to-field and 31 field-to-field cases. The results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves an accuracy of 100% on a baler implement dataset and 98.84% on a mower implement dataset.

Currently, machine learning and deep learning approaches are being utilized, making agriculture one of the most researched topics in AI. This study proposes a novel framework for predicting maize plant disease using a fusion of multi-deep learning models. The proposed framework uses a four-stage pipeline for detecting disease in maize plants by fusion of Xception, DenseNet-121, and ensembling of Xception and DenseNet-121 models to achieve excellent results on the OSF drone image dataset, which consists of 1821 high-resolution images of maize plants taken from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The accuracy of our proposed approach is 96.95%, which is highly effective, considering the challenges posed by drone images.","","979-8-3503-2148-7","10.1109/ICCIT58132.2023.10273966","Science Foundation Ireland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10273966","Deep learning;Plant Disease Detection;UAV;Xception;DenseNet-121;Fusion;Multimodal;precision agriculture","Plant diseases;Biological system modeling;Pipelines;Stochastic processes;Food industry;Predictive models;Autonomous aerial vehicles","","4","","25","IEEE","10 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dataset is registered using photogrammetry aided by fiducial ground control points (GCPs). Unfortunately, GCPs severely disrupt crop management activities. To address this, we propose a novel inter-day registration approach that only relies once on GCPs, at the beginning of the season.The method utilises LoFTR [1], a state-of-the-art image-matching transformer. The original LoFTR network was trained using imagery of outdoor urban areas. One of our contributions is to extend LoFTR’s training method, which uses matching images of a static scene, to a dynamic scene of plants undergoing growth. Another contribution is a thorough evaluation of our registration method that integrates intraday crop reconstruction with earlier-day scans in a seven degree-of-freedom alignment. Experimental results show the advantage of our approach over other matching algorithms and demonstrate the importance of retraining using crop scenes, and a training method customised for growing crops, with an average registration error of 27 cm across a season.","","979-8-3503-8457-4","10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10611221","European Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10611221","","Precision agriculture;Training;Visualization;Image resolution;Accuracy;Plants (biology);Crops","","3","","36","IEEE","8 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A system for accurately identifying crops and weeds in images is crucial component of automated weeding equipment. However, in the field environment, crops and weeds grow intertwined, and weeds are very similar to sugarcane leaves, making it difficult to accurately segment crops, weeds, and their boundaries from images. In this paper, we proposed a novel network that fully utilizes low-level semantic information to accurately segment crops and weeds in images, improving the accuracy of crop and weed segmentation while reducing the need for training weight parameters and improving speed in the prediction stage. Specifically, we made three important modifications for crop and weed identification. First, a Multi-scale Feature Extraction and Fusion module (MFEF) was designed to capture abundant low-level semantic feature information. Afterward, we introduce a Global Response Normalization (GRN) block to select more useful feature information. Finally, a series of residual attention transformer layers are designed to transmit the long-range dependency information extracted between layers. Numerous experimental results confirmed that our proposed network achieved excellent performance in segmenting sugarcane and weed images. Specifically, (1) the mean accuracy and, Mean Intersection of Union (MIoU) reached 96.97% and 94.13%, respectively, (2) the training parameters of the model have been reduced by more than 25%, improving the Frames Per Second (FPS) value of the prediction process, and (3) is also effective on the publicly available BoniRob Dataset, indicating that the proposed model has considerable generalization ability.

In consequence, increasing crop production through traditional farming methods will not address the global food scarcity problem. As a precision agriculture approach, aeroponics, a soilless agriculture technique, can assist in cultivating in-demand food crops, which will help serve the people. Because aeroponics is an indoor farming technology, factors such as pH, EC, light, temperature, PPM, and turbidity will affect crop growth. Hence, monitoring an aeroponic crop growth system efficiently is crucial for achieving a high crop yield and reducing the need for food crops. Even though, many crop monitoring systems use IoT and machine learning algorithms, their prediction accuracy is not up to the level and if they are deployed in the real world, they may not meet customer expectations. In order to efficiently monitor crops, more advanced models are needed. However, understanding the large volume of data can be very tedious. Data visualization techniques can help make the distribution of the dataset easier to understand. Machine learning methods and packages can be used for environmental monitoring and visualization of the data where, the collection of crop growth dataset is carried out using various IoT sensors deployed in the growth environment.

Traditional methods for disease detection are often labourintensive and subject to human error, underscoring the need for more accurate and automated solutions. This study introduces a novel approach by employing advanced deep learning architectures, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), to classify and identify prevalent rice leaf diseases. Our research contrasts the performance of custom CNN models against that of cutting-edge ViT models within the context of rice leaf disease classification. Utilising a comprehensive rice leaf dataset, we meticulously evaluate both models based on their diagnostic accuracy, adaptability to varying imaging conditions, and overall computational efficiency. The results of our investigation are compelling, revealing that the custom CNN achieved a commendable classification accuracy of 96.33%, while the enhanced ViT model demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 98.42%. These findings not only highlight the potential of ViTs in agricultural applications but also suggest a significant advancement over traditional CNN approaches. By integrating these deep learning models, we aim to provide a more efficient and reliable framework for early disease detection, ultimately contributing to improved crop management and increased agricultural productivity.

However, since the learned feature spaces are suboptimal, there exists many virtual connections where visual features and semantic attributes are not corresponding to each other. To reduce virtual connections, in this paper, we propose to discover comprehensive and fine-grained object parts by building explanatory graphs based on convolutional feature maps, then aggregate object parts to train a part-net to obtain prediction results. Since the aggregated object parts contain comprehensive visual features for activating semantic attributes, the virtual connections can be reduced by a large extent. Since part-net aims to extract local fine-grained visual features, some attributes related to global structures are ignored. To take advantage of both local and global visual features, we design a feature distiller to distill local features into a master-net which aims to extract global features.

In particular, the study concentrates on five unique categories of watermelon leaf diseases presented as a distributed dataset across the five clients to reflect FL's decentralisation. The core mechanism lies in the seamless local data training with federated averaging that transforms locally learned insights into an upgraded global model. In the proposed experimental setting, each client (si_1 to si_5) learned a local CNN model using their data of different disease manifestations. Each local model was thoroughly evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score support, and accuracy metrics. Of note, the performance results showed high accuracy on all the clients, with mean accuracy scores between 0.96 and 0.97, indicating how very effective this model was in various data settings. The study additionally explores the analysis of federated averaging, which includes macro, micro, and weighted aggregates to capture collective learning through local models. The mean values of the clients' si_1 to si_5 were 91.70%, 93.48%, and so on. The weighted averages maintained a significant correlation with the macro averages, which varied between 90.70% and 93.47%, confirming that classes were generally balanced in datasets. Similarly, the macro average overall efficiency for all cases was at per cent. In summary, this study highlights the prospects of federated learning with CNNs for revolutionising plant disease detection and classification by embracing decentralised, heterogeneous agricultural environments.","","979-8-3503-6153-7","10.1109/APCIT62007.2024.10673452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10673452","Watermelon leaves;Leaf diseases;(CNN)_(FL);Disease;Augmentation image;data privacy;data security","Measurement;Training;Plant diseases;Technological innovation;Accuracy;Federated learning;Transforms","","2","","18","IEEE","18 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Henriksen","Jožef Stefan Institute Slovenia School of Science Aalto University, Finland; Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Denmark; Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Denmark",2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),"24 Feb 2020","2019","","","5140","5148","UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris agreement for climate change indicate that a transition to sustainable and healthy diets is necessary. Additionally, the fact that agricultural sector is responsible for near a quarter of global greenhouse emissions (IPCC 2019 - special report on climate change), such transition will require substantial dietary shifts, including reduction of sugar and red meat consumption. Vietnam, with more than 95 millions of population, have a challenge to significantly reduce the rice consumption and convert some of the land used for it to production of more legumes. However, correct allocation of arable land for cultivation of particular crops’ combination that would ease the transition, and comply with recommendations for healthy nutritional intake, is a challenge of the society. We approached the problem of arable land allocation with mathematical optimization, in particular stochastic evolutionary computing. Arable land allocation to crops’ combination is evaluated through three objectives: food self-sufficiency, climate efficiency and crop diversity. Candidate solutions (crops’ combinations) were analysed through the non-dominated Pareto front with prioritizing the objective of food self-sufficiency of Vietnam. The results suggest significant change in production of certain crops. As such, sugar cane and rice are required to be reduced on expense of increased production of soybeans, maize, brassicas, and nuts. Therefore, the current surplus of produced carbohydrates would be reduced while proteins increased, which leads to balanced production of macronutrients.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006264","","Agriculture;Climate change;Optimization;Resource management;Sociology;Statistics;Databases","","2","","30","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the collection of farming data, especially geospatial data, raises concerns about potential privacy leakage. In this paper, we propose a novel scalable and private continual geo-distance evaluation system, called SPRIDE, to allow application servers to provide geographic based services by computing the distances among sensors and farms privately and continuously. The servers determine the distances without learning any additional information about their locations. The key idea of SPRIDE is to perform efficient distance evaluations on encrypted locations over a sphere by leveraging a homomorphic cryptosystem. To scale for a large user base, we propose novel and practical performance enhancements based on data segmentation and distance prediction techniques for reducing computation/communication costs. Through extensive experiments on a real world mobile trace dataset, we show SPRIDE achieves real-time private distance evaluation on a large network of farms, attaining at least 17 times runtime performance improvement over existing methods. We further show SPRIDE can run on resource-constrained mobile devices with low overhead.","","978-1-5386-0683-4","10.1109/CNS.2017.8228620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8228620","","Servers;Agriculture;Real-time systems;Sensors;Cryptography;Privacy;Geospatial analysis","","2","","27","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It takes a manual process and takes a long time to get leaf samples that are representative of the observed oil palm area, especially in peat soil area. In addition, laboratory analysis of leaf samples is expensive and introduces creates significant time delays for queuing. This paper discusses methods for measuring leaf nitrogen levels in a timely manner based on imagery obtained by C-SAR Sentinel-1A using smart and precision agricultural approaches and applications. The intelligent computational model uses Random Forest Regression to calculate leaf nitrogen content based on spatial image processing and analysis. The calculated leaf nitrogen content is then used to examine and identify the variability of nitrogen content in a given oil palm area. Identification of nutrient variability is one of the approaches and goals of precision agriculture. Our computation model was developed using 553 leaf sampling units (LSU) and validated using 10-Fold validation method, resulting in correctness, MAPE, RMSE and R2 of 95.69%, 4.31%, 0.1119 and 93.28% respectively. The validated model was tested using a set of new data, which is not in the data samples for model development and validation, was resulting in correctness, MAPE, RMSE and R2 of 89.91%, 10.11%, 0.284, and 53.89% respectively. The visual maps can be produced and displayed to visualize variability of nitrogen contents in a peat soil area. This improves visibility and transparency in monitoring nutrient in timely and periodic manner. The future use of the proposed method is to support the application of smart and precision agriculture practices to recommend fertilizers types and dozes for oil palm in peat soil areas based on the variability of leaf nutrient contents.","","979-8-3503-2095-4","10.1109/ICCoSITE57641.2023.10127812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127812","intelligent system;nutrient monitoring;oil palm management;remote sensing technology;spatial maps","Visualization;Soil measurements;Computational modeling;Oils;Soil;Data models;Agriculture","","2","","31","IEEE","23 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the performance of models is limited by the amount of data as well as impacted by the imbalance distribution between categories. This study proposes a novel generative data augmentation strategy to enhance classifier performance in plant disease classification tasks. First, elucidated diffusion models (EDM) were proposed to synthesize high-quality synthetic images of grape leaf diseases. This approach effectively mitigates the overfitting and unbalanced problems caused by insufficient data. Secondly, the three pre-train CNN-based models, ResNet50, VGG16, and AlexNet, were employed to classify grape leaf diseases based on the enhanced dataset by combining the generative image. These models effectively capture global features using larger convolutional kernels with overlapping pooling methods and progressively refine these features to extract detailed information from the images. At last, the framework could achieve high performance in classifying healthy grape leaves and three disease types, where the average precision (PR), recall (RE), F1-score (F1), and accuracy (ACC) across four classes were black rot, black measles, healthy and isariopsis leaf spot.This study demonstrated that the generative strategy could enhance the data with a limited amount and sported effective learning in grape leaf disease classification.

Within the scope of this investigation, a model is trained using the original dataset, which comprises two distinct classes of yolov7: wild and cultivated plants. The training process yields a model that exhibits a precision rate of 99.6%. Furthermore, the identification of obstacles is accomplished through the utilization of depth information obtained from the camera system installed on the vehicle. By utilizing the IMU sensor included within the camera and incorporating depth information, a two-dimensional array is employed to replicate the surrounding world. Through the examination of the incoming data pertaining to the simulated environment, as well as the positions of vehicles and obstacles, it becomes feasible to determine the appropriate placement of vegetation and agricultural products, whether they have been subjected to spraying or not.

It integrates several innovative techniques to enhance detection efficiency and accuracy. First, a Super Token Sampling Vision Transformer (SViT) is employed to model global context and improve feature representation. Second, a novel multi-level attention mechanism (MultiSEAM) is introduced to enhance the detection of overlapping targets caused by occlusion. Lastly, we propose the Inner-IoU strategy for bounding box regression, accelerating the regression process for overlapping regions, improving both speed and accuracy.

Hierarchical approaches are based on a step-by-step strategy and aim to optimize performance on difficult tasks by solving successive subtasks. The gain provided by these solutions must be relativized with the explosion in the number of parameters they imply, which makes their implementation on embedded systems difficult. New constraints also appear in the choice of the architectures of the branches when one seeks to have a global network providing predictions at different levels. We propose a strategy that allows the merging of heterogeneous CNNs by following a hierarchical approach in which the information extracted by first-level networks can be fed back at any location into second-level networks. Despite the differences in the number and size of the feature maps, such grafting can be done by using clustering, dimension reduction, and interpolation techniques. This strategy eliminates the computational redundancy induced by the recalculation of low-level features. The proposed grafting approach significantly reduces the inference time of the second network without impacting the accuracy. Tests performed on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and PlantVillage datasets with several CNNs illustrate the possibility of implementation in various situations.

Accurate anomaly detection in agricultural UAV images is vital for early identification of field irregularities. Traditional supervised learning faces challenges in adapting to diverse anomalies, necessitating extensive annotated data. In this work, we overcome this limitation with self-supervised learning using a masked image modeling approach. Masked Autoencoders (MAE) extract meaningful normal features from unlabeled image samples which produces high reconstruction error for the abnormal pixels during reconstruction. To remove the need of using only ""normal"" data while training, we use an anomaly suppression loss mechanism that effectively minimizes the reconstruction of anomalous pixels and allows the model to learn anomalous areas without explicitly separating ""normal"" images for training.

This article presents a novel automated approach for grapevine leaf categorization utilizing DenseNet-121, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network distinguished for image recognition performance. Essential for the wine and fruit sectors, grapevines (Vitis vinifera) show a variety of leaf traits vital for precise varietal identification. These leaves require an effective automated solution since manual classification of them is labor-intensive and prone to mistakes. In this work, we classify five different types of high-resolution grapevine leaf photos from a dataset: Ak, Ala Idris, Buzgulu, Dimnit, and Nazli. Resized to 256x256 pixels, the photos are handled to produce a batch size of 32 and a classification accuracy of 96%. There are five main parts to the approach: analysis; model architecture construction; preprocessing and dataset collecting; model training and evaluation. Resizing and normalizing photos helps the Kaggle-derived dataset to be pre-processed so standardizing inputs. DenseNet-121 is chosen for its effective feature extraction and dense connection; its design is modified for the classification purpose by changing the last layer. To improve model generalization, training comprises categorical cross-entropy loss, the Adam optimizer, and data augmentation methods. Validation and test datasets help to evaluate performance; metrics including accuracy and F1-score direct model improvement. The findings confirm that DenseNet-121 greatly increases grapevine leaf identification accuracy and efficiency, hence lowering manual labor and raising classification consistency.

However, monitoring land-cover dynamics in arid regions presents challenges due to landscapes complexity and limited training samples. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach that combines spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and adaptive strategies to automatically generate high-quality training samples for mapping large-scale land-cover dynamics in Guanzhong Plain (GZ), China. SMA was employed to develop new indices for detecting spatiotemporal changes and boundaries in land cover: the endmember abundance vegetation index (EAVI) and the heterogeneity detection index ( ${\text {HDI}}_{\text {RMSE}}$ ). Subsequently, the spatial consistency region of multisource products was automatically generated using spatial superposition analysis, the morphological corrosion method, and  ${\text {HDI}}_{\text {RMSE}}$ . Once the initial training sample pool was created, it was optimized and updated through an adaptive sampling strategy to ensure a representative dataset. Additionally, by integrating the EAVI with CCD algorithm (CCD_EAVI), the spatiotemporally stable regions of land cover change were identified, enabling the automatic updating of annual training samples. Finally, a spatiotemporal consistency optimization approach was employed to improve the temporal stability of the time-series product. Based on independent validation samples, the overall accuracy of the land-cover mapping of the GZ in 2020 reached 97.92%, with an average mapping accuracy exceeding 96% over the past 32 years.

We utilize the real-world datasets to verify the accuracy of the comparison methods and the proposed framework in the prediction of trajectory interpolation. The experimental results show that our framework is significantly superior to the comparison methods. We utilize several common road trajectories to verify the accuracy of the proposed trajectory interpolation prediction framework. The experimental results show that our framework is superior to the baselines.","","978-1-6654-1300-8","10.1109/ICEITSA54226.2021.00037","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172182); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9707366","VSN;trajectory collection;ensemble learning;GPS outage","Training;Interpolation;Social networking (online);Roads;Predictive models;Trajectory;Bayes methods","","1","","17","IEEE","16 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to a broad range of rice varieties, each of which has specific properties and characteristics, accurate categorization of rice variations is essential for agricultural practices, commerce, and culinary uses. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an excellent option for tackling the difficulties of rice variety categorization since they have become a potent deep-learning technique. A CNN model for the precise and efficient categorization of rice types is presented in this study. An extensive set of 75,000 images from five different types of rice (Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag) was assembled for model training and assessment. To facilitate unbiased performance measurement, the dataset was partitioned at random into a training batch of 60,000 images and a test batch of 15,000 images. CNNs can learn hierarchical representations of visual input, allowing them to recognize complex patterns and connections within images, making them ideally suited for computer vision applications, notably image classification. This skill is essential for classifying rice varieties since it allows for detecting minute variations across rice kinds. The research's findings are encouraging because the proposed CNN model had a remarkable accuracy on the test set of 97.31%. This high degree of precision supports the model's outstanding capacity to distinguish between the five annotated classes of rice varieties, demonstrating the promise of deep learning methods in solving complex agricultural problems. The efficacy of this CNN-based strategy will significantly impact the agriculture industry.

The methodology begins with the preprocessing of a comprehensive dataset of maize crop images. These images are resized to 224x224 pixels to ensure uniformity and standardization across the dataset, which is crucial for the effective training of the CNN. Pixel values are also standardized to optimize the model's preparation phase. Transfer learning is employed, utilizing pre-trained ImageNet weights, which facilitates faster convergence and improves predictive accuracy by leveraging the vast amount of knowledge already embedded in the EfficientNetB0 model. EfficientNetB0 serves as the foundational architecture due to its balanced trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. The model's design includes dropout regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting, which is essential for maintaining generalizability to unseen data. Dense layers are incorporated for hierarchical feature extraction, while global average pooling is used for feature aggregation, reducing the risk of overfitting and maintaining model efficiency. Batch normalization is used to provide consistent learning rates across all layers of the model and to expedite and stabilize the training process. TensorFlow and Keras, powerful deep learning frameworks, are utilized to build and train the model.

Due to climatic changes and increasing problems in protecting the environment, farmers are faced with great challenges. In order to automate, specify and simplify processes, reliable decision-making bases for the control of irrigation, fertilization and plant protection measures with a close-meshed database are required. This can be achieved with cost-efficiently produced and environmentally friendly sensor systems for monitoring cultivated areas. Such a monitoring system is currently being developed, first laboratory samples are available and are being tested step by step in laboratory and field. The single sensor devices consist of a miniaturized electronic module with single-chip radio system, sensors for measuring temperature, soil tension, in the near future leaf wetness and nitrate. The sensors and the electronic module are fabricated from materials that are biodegradable or inert with a minimum amount of metal and ceramic and allow for remaining them on the field when harvesting. The device is powered by a biodegradable zinc-manganese dioxide battery. For wireless communication, a printed antenna on a wood carrier is used. A gateway collects the data transmitted by the distributed sensor devices and brings it to the internet to a central server running an expert system. The technologies used for the assembly, such as roll-to-roll and screen printing, and the materials used, such as wood and paper, enable inexpensive and partly biodegradable sensors that are applied to the field once per growing season in high density. This enables fine-mesh, site-specific treatments and a further reduction in water, fertiliser and pesticide use.","","979-8-3503-2506-5","10.1109/SSI58917.2023.10387957","Federal Ministry of Education and Research(grant numbers:16MEO160); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10387957","Environmental friendly sensor nodes;plant monitoring;smart farming","Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Soil measurements;Sociology;System integration;Soil","","","","9","IEEE","17 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between GVMI and NDMI, with a coefficient as high as 0.97, while their correlation with rainfall is minimal. Consequently, future research will further explore the impact of rainfall on these indices. Specifically, we investigated whether substantial increases in these indices are linked to rainfall and examined the correlation between their growth rates and rainfall. Our findings indicate that approximately 70% of significant increases are attributed to rainfall. Additionally, due to the inherent lag in satellite data’s response to rainfall-—here substantial changes may not be immediate but require some time to manifest—we explored the time lag needed for significant changes in NDMI and GVMI to occur after rainfall. The results demonstrate that NDMI is more sensitive and reacts more quickly to rainfall, with $\mathbf{9 2 \%}$ of the data showing significant increases or decreases within two days following rainfall, compared to $\mathbf{7 0 \%}$ for GVMI.","2993-396X","979-8-3315-2086-1","10.1109/SWC62898.2024.00320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10924859","Digital twins;Sentinel Images;Meteorology Dataset;GVMI;NDMI","Smart agriculture;Rain;Correlation;Satellites;Fluctuations;Stability criteria;Moisture;Crops;Digital twins;Meteorology","","","","22","IEEE","24 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Apple crops are susceptible to a range of diseases that can do a lot of harm to the fruit and the trees, reducing yields and affecting the quality of the apples. This, in turn, leads to lower revenues for growers and a higher cost of production. The symptoms of different apple diseases can sometimes be similar, making it difficult for farmers to accurately diagnose the problem and choose the appropriate treatment. In some cases, multiple diseases can occur simultaneously, further complicating the diagnosis and management of the problem. To overcome this challenge, an initiative is conceptualized to provide a quick and precise apple disease detection and classification. In this paper, a deep learning based approach for classifying and identifying apple diseases has been proposed wherein the generated dataset is fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model which comprises the object identification (for locating & identifying objects of interest in an image), segmentation (for separating the objects from the background), and image classification (for assigning each object to a specific class or category). Further data augmentation methods including scaling, rotation, reflection were also incorporated for better learning of underlying patterns in the data, leading to improved generalization and reduced over-fitting. The proposed CNN method achieved impressive results, scoring about 97.06 % accuracy as well as better score for other evaluating metrics, such as precision, recall, or F1-score. Therefore, by using a CNN model to accurately diagnose different apple diseases, farmers can make informed decisions about how to manage their crops, leading to improved yields and higher revenues.","","979-8-3503-4096-9","10.1109/AGEC57922.2023.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10327856","Crop yield;Deep learning;Prediction accuracy;Data augmentation","Measurement;Industries;Transfer learning;Neural networks;Crops;Production;Reflection","","","","23","IEEE","28 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article identifies these obstacles and proposes leveraging Federated Learning (FL) to overcome them. However, the application of federating machine learning algorithms within the agricultural domain is still in its infancy. We introduce the Federated Learning Assisted Agriculture 4.0 (AgriFL 4.0) framework, designed to ensure privacy while collaboratively analyzing distributed agricultural data. Within AgriFL 4.0, a common Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model is trained locally to analyze decentralized agricultural data. Additionally, a consolidated model is formed at the server using the Federated Average aggregation technique. For this study, we employ the Dry Bean Dataset from Kaggle, assembled in 2020, consisting of 13,611 instances with 16 attributes, including dimensions and shape forms crucial for seed classification. To evaluate AgriFL 4.0's performance on horizontally distributed agricultural data, we categorize the dataset into two types: lID and non-lID. In our simulation involving 10 clients, we explored scenarios featuring 0%, 40%, and 80% stragglers-nodes encountering delays. Moreover, we compare the federated and non-federated model performances. The results indicate that the framework works well with lID data, and the federated model outperforms the non-federated model in terms of classification accuracy and other performance metrics. However, with non-lID data, the framework's performance degrades as the count of stragglers increases.

However, in southern regions, the parcels tend to be small, structurally complex, and fragmented, posing challenges for precise extraction using existing convolutional neural network (CNNs) based on deep learning. To address these issues, we introduced a novel neural network model, i.e., CLCFormer, which combines CNN and Swin-Transformer. This model leverages the strengths of CNN in capturing fine-grained spatial details and the ability of Transformer in extracting global semantic features. We introduced three distinct modules to refine the learning of spatial features, enhance the accuracy of parcel extraction in mountainous and hilly regions, and mitigate the boundary blurriness caused by occluded objects. Finally, we employed a post-processing method to achieve regularized parcel extraction. Our study was tested on GF-2 high-resolution remote sensing datasets from Nanping and Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China.

The study suggests a new way to determine whether a farm is suitable for a given crop by combining several machine learning algorithms, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (RBMs). Our objective is to combine these models so that we can better understand the patterns in agricultural data that are influenced by multiple variables, including weather, soil, crop yields, and other environmental factors. For the purpose of handling consecutive data and predicting future climatic trends that affect farming suitability, our long short-term memory (LSTM) model is designed. By expertly analysing patterns in satellite pictures and other spatial data, the CNN component assesses land qualities. Lastly, important factors influencing agricultural production are extracted using the RBM's feature learning abilities. Our integrated model was trained using a massive dataset collected from various agro-climatic zones. How well the model projected, given both present and future conditions, whether a plot of land would be appropriate for a specific crop was used to evaluate its effectiveness. The results demonstrate that our technique can reliably forecast which farms would be the best fit. Additionally, our model can assist lawmakers and farmers in making educated decisions regarding crop rotation, land usage, and operational management.

Nevertheless the agricultural sector encounters significant obstacles in the shape of many illnesses that possess the potential to cause severe damage to crop productivity and jeopardize the availability of food resources. The proposed work endeavors to undertake a thorough investigation to tackle these issues by creating a resilient system for detecting diseases and classifying rice plants into multiple categories. Rice farming is faced with several frequent illnesses, each possessing distinct characteristics and exerting a specific impact on the health of the crop. The diseases encompassing rice blast, rice blight, hispa disease, and rice stem rot disease are widely recognized for their significant capacity to case extensive harm. Differentiating these illnesses from healthy rice plants is a procedure that requires significant labor and is susceptible to errors when conducted manually. To address these problems, the suggested study has carefully assembled a dataset consisting of high-resolution photos of rice plants. These images encompass a range of growth phases and indications of diseases. By utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) methodologies, the proposed work developed an advanced image processing model that exhibits the ability to classify rice plants into five discrete categories: healthy, rice blast, rice blight, hispa disease, and rice stem rot disease, without the need for manual intervention.

However, the tea industry, though, is confronted with numerous challenges, including unpredictable weather conditions, improper fertilizer application, pest and disease outbreaks, and suboptimal cultivation practices. These challenges are leading to lower yield and more losses. With the increasing unpredictability of weather patterns, it is challenging to determine the precise fertilizer application schedule and dosage. In terms of pest and diseases, effect of the Shot-hole borer, Tea Blister Blight and Stem and Branch Canker are more destructive to the tea plant. Therefore, accurate weather prediction and the early detection of those infections are crucial tasks in tea cultivation. This study presents a smart monitoring system for Sri Lankan tea crop that combines IoT, image processing, audio processing, and DL technologies to address such problems. The Smart Monitoring System gives growers a full toolkit by providing real-time weather insights, fertilizer delivery depending on weather conditions, early insect detection, disease identification, and damage quantification.

As a famous food production State in Brazil, there have been intensive agricultural activities in Mato Grosso State. The conversion of pasture to croplands has influenced the accumulation and distribution of SOC stocks in the State. This work aimed at determining the spatial variations in SOC stocks and its relationship with land use and environmental drivers in Mato Grosso, a high agricultural frontier State of Brazil. Data containing SOC content at the topsoil layer (0-30cm), land use, and environmental indicators data were collected and analyzed from both field and secondary sources including satellite images. The results revealed that SOC stores were higher in croplands (especially with dual or multi-crops) when compared with forests, pasture, and other land use. It was further observed that SOC had a positive correlation with land use (r = 0.64), elevation (r = 0.56), rainfall (r = 0.39), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (r = 0.40), bare soil index (BSI) (r = 0.40), and land surface temperature (LST) (r = 0.39). The adoption of low-carbon farming (such as crop-livestock forest, integrated crop-livestock, agroforestry, and other conservational agricultural practices) in Mato Grosso has crucial role in providing sustainable environmental and economic development of Mato Grosso, Brazil, and other regions. Thus, agricultural agendas focusing on climate-smart farming should be incorporated into the government's policy making schemes.

However, manual identification of leaf disease over large farms is time-consuming and requires human effort. Also, in several types of leaf disease, the specific type that occurs in the plant should be distinguished; thus, proper knowledge of farming is required. To simplify this and to know the type of disease, smart agricultural practices are followed worldwide. One of the intelligent techniques adopted in farming is leaf disease detection. By providing the filed image to a learning algorithm, the type of disease can be detected accurately without manual interventions. ML and DL are used in this smart agricultural practice.

This work aims to address this issue by use of cutting edge deep learning technologies. The paper examines how effectively various models identify plant diseases. Among the models it examines are VGG13, Squeezenet1_1, ResNet34, Inception_ v3, and DenseNet169. Information utilized includes a baseline class from the DAGS dataset and 38 distinct plant diseases from the PlantVillage dataset that was taken from Kaggle. The findings indicate that various designs and training methods function somewhat differently. AlexNet, for instance, reaches 99.24% accuracy after extensive retraining. When DenseNet169 is deep retrained, however, it does incredibly well, achieving 99.72% accuracy. To better comprehend the behavior of the models, the study involves visualization experiments in addition to accuracy measurements. Heat maps that graphically illustrate how various aspects of a picture impact the choices the computer program makes are displayed in the occlusion experiment. The saliency map experiment determines the most significant pixels using mathematical means. This clarifies the ways in which the model draws judgments. With AlexNet and VGG13, images of several plant diseases like Early Blight, Late Blight, and Septoria Leaf Spot are displayed. In conclusion, this paper presents key details concerning the operation of many deep learning models for identifying plant diseases. The outcomes facilitate the selection of the optimal models and training programs, therefore enhancing the development of reliable and robust automated systems for plant disease diagnosis. Using the newest technologies, this research is a crucial first step in introducing sophisticated disease detection to agriculture.","","979-8-3503-7700-2","10.1109/ICSPCRE62303.2024.10675064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10675064","Deep Learning;Plant Disease Detection;Convolutional Neural Networks;Occlusion Experiment;Saliency Map;PyTorch;Model Visualization;Interpretability;Agriculture","Deep learning;Training;Plant diseases;Visualization;Pathology;Accuracy;Computational modeling","","","","20","IEEE","25 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
