Utilizing drone imagery, we collected a dataset and proposed a customized model to achieve optimal performance. Our proposed model uses strategically modified backbone, neck, and head components, leveraging elements such as Ghost Convolution, BottleNeckCSP, and ECA (Efficient Channel Attention) layers. These modifications enhance the model's capability to discern intricate patterns in drone imagery, ultimately leading to improved precision in weed detection. We introduce a purposefully crafted dataset to complement the model's training, and our experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to the baseline models. Our model achieves a precision of 72.5%, recall of 68.0%, and mAP@0.5 of 73.9, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing detection accuracy. Leveraging a unique blend of feature extraction mechanisms, our model achieves remarkable accuracy in real-time soybean detection, outperforming established models like RT-DETR (Real-Time DEtection TransfoRmer) and YOLOv10. A detailed ablation study and comparative analysis with different YOLO versions and the transformer-based RT-DETR showcase the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements. Our work signifies a significant step towards advancing the field of precision agriculture, offering a model that is not only adaptive but also robust in identifying and localizing weeds in soybean fields. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Imaging; Agricultural Robotics; Agricultural Technology; Automated Weed Identification; Deep Learning For Crop Management; Drone Imagery; Precision Agriculture; Agricultural Imaging; Agricultural Robotics; Agricultural Technologies; Automated Weed Identification; Crop Managements; Deep Learning For Crop Management; Drone Imagery; Precision Agriculture; Weed Detection; Weed Identification","Agricultural imaging; Agricultural robotics; Agricultural technologies; Automated weed identification; Crop managements; Deep learning for crop management; Drone imagery; Precision Agriculture; Weed detection; Weed identification","","","This publication is based upon work supported by the Khalifa University of Science and Technology under Award No. CIRA-2021-085 , FSU-2021-019 , RC1-2018-KUCARS .

At present, the agricultural sector worldwide is rapidly pacing towards technology-driven Precision Agriculture (PA) approaches for enhancing crop protection and boosting productivity. Literature highlights the limitations of traditional approaches such as chances of human error in recognizing and counting pests, and require trained labor. Against such a backdrop, this paper proposes a smart IoT-based pest detection platform for integrated pest management, and monitoring crop field conditions that are of crucial help to farmers in real field environments. The proposed system comprises a physical prototype of a smart insect trap equipped with embedded computing to detect and classify pests. To this aim, a dataset was created featuring images of oriental fruit flies captured under varying illumination conditions in guava orchards. The size of the dataset is 1000+ images categorized into two groups: (1) fruit fly and (2) not fruit fly and a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier was trained based on the following features: (1) Haralick features (2) Histogram of oriented gradients (3) Hu moments and (4) Color histogram. The system achieved a recall value of 86.2% for real test images with Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 97.3%. Additionally, the proposed model has been compared with numerous machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based models to verify the efficacy of the proposed model. The comparative results indicated that the best performance was achieved by the proposed model with the highest accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and FNR with values of 97.5%, 92.82%, 98.92%, 95.00%, 95.90%, and 5.88% respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Internet Of Things; Machine Learning; Smart Insect Trap; Accuracy; Agricultural Worker; Article; Bullock; Classifier; Color; Controlled Study; Convolutional Neural Network; Crop Protection; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Drosophila Melanogaster; Food Insecurity; Guava; Histogram; Illumination; Integrated Pest Management; Internet Of Things; Machine Learning; Orchard; Pakistan; Pest Control; Precision Agriculture; Agriculture; Animal; Artificial Neural Network; Crop; Growth, Development And Aging; Human; Parasitology; Procedures; Psidium; Agriculture; Animals; Crops, Agricultural; Humans; Internet Of Things; Neural Networks, Computer; Pest Control","accuracy; agricultural worker; article; bullock; classifier; color; controlled study; convolutional neural network; crop protection; deep learning; diagnosis; Drosophila melanogaster; food insecurity; guava; histogram; illumination; integrated pest management; internet of things; machine learning; orchard; Pakistan; pest control; precision agriculture; agriculture; animal; artificial neural network; crop; growth, development and aging; human; parasitology; procedures; Psidium; Agriculture; Animals; Crops, Agricultural; Humans; Internet of Things; Neural Networks, Computer; Pest Control","","","The authors acknowledge the support from grant number PCC-Grant-202234 from the PMU Cyber security Center, Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University, Kingdom Saudi Arabia.

In this study, we first clarified the definition of field robots and review the different development stages of agricultural robots. Secondly, we searched and screened 678 relevant literature from electronic databases such as Science Direct, Web of Science, etc., and quantitatively analyzed all the literature in terms of three dimensions: year of publication, country, and keywords. Then, we systematically provided the current research status of ploughing-seeding, weeding, monitoring, harvesting, and information-gathering, crop protection and agricultural fly robots. Furthermore, the global development of field robots shows a trend of rapid growth and technology upgrading, and we proposed the common key technologies of field robots, including intelligent sensing, smart decision-making and control, dexterous arm and hand operation, autonomous and stable walking, and Cloud-Edge-End fusion intelligent operation. Finally, we summarized the challenges faced by robots, such as low sensing accuracy, poor operability, and low operating efficiency.

Plant biotic and abiotic stressors are primarily induced by climate change, resulting in a detrimental effect on worldwide agricultural productivity. These two components are closely interconnected. This paper presents an innovative approach in smart agriculture for climate change combining remote sensing and a deep learning algorithm. The input is obtained as a multispectral environmental image and then subjected to noise reduction and normalisation processing. The image has been retrieved using a primary convolutional component with a stacked encoder model. The retrieved features are identified using ResNet graph reinforcement neural networks. The resulting classification output displays environmental imagery depicting climate variations. The agriculture sector has been analysed based on the classified climate analysis. The experimental results have been conducted on diverse farm datasets related to climate change, evaluating the detection accuracy, recall, mean average precision, normalized correlation, and F-1 score. The proposed method achieved a detection accuracy of 98%, a normalised correlation of 95%, a mean average precision of 92%, a recall of 97%, and an F-MEASURE of 94%.

Timely and effective weed control is crucial in modern precision agriculture. However, the diversity and morphological differences of weeds, and visual similarities between symbiotic weeds and crops pose significant challenges to weed detection. With the development of deep learning, crop detection has accomplished remarkable achievements in precision agriculture. Introducing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms into the winter wheat weed detection task is expected to provide a meaningful decision-making basis for precision weed management. However, current deep learning-based winter wheat weed detection methods still suffer severe challenges in terms of accuracy and speed. This can be mainly attributed to two aspects: the lack of high-quality and large-capacity datasets and the insufficient adaptability of detection models to specific datasets. This study is dedicated to filling the gap in winter wheat weed detection research from both the aspects of datasets and deep learning algorithms. Firstly, we present a new high-quality winter wheat weed dataset (3W dataset), which contains 9,278 manually annotated RGB images of 8 common winter wheat weed species. Then, we verify the feasibility of the 3W dataset by reproducing some SOTA models, including R-CNN, YOLO, and Transformer series. Based on the comparison results, we used the YOLOv8 model with faster inference speed and the DINO model with the best detection accuracy as the baselines and introduced some mainstream improving strategies such as spatial attention mechanism (SAM), Non-local block (NLB) and deformable convolution network v2 (DCNv2) to further improve their performance. The results of ablation experiments show that NLB can effectively improve the performance of YOLOv8 and DINO by enhancing their global modeling capabilities. Compared with the original YOLOv8, the mAP of the YOLOv8_NLB model is increased from 85.8 % to 88.3 %, and the inference speed is 84.6 FPS. The mAP of our improved DINO_NLB increased from 88.6 % to 89.4 %, occupying the highest detection accuracy. However, its detection speed is only about one-third of YOLOv8_NLB. To sum up, for weed detection tasks with high-speed requirements, it is recommended to use the YOLOv8_NLB model, and for scenarios that pursue high accuracy, the DINO_NLB model is an ideal choice. Finally, we deployed the faster YOLOv8_NLB model on the TensorRT format and quantized it in Jetson Xavier NX. The TensorRT_FP16 model achieves a better balance between speed and accuracy, with an inference speed of 40.5 FPS and an mAP of 86.7 %, which is more suitable for real-world weeding tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Dino; Non-local Block (nlb); Winter Wheat Weed; Yolov8; Block Modeling; Deep Learning; Dino; Non-local Block; Nonlocal; Precision Agriculture; Weed Detection; Winter Wheat; Winter Wheat Weed; Yolov8; Algorithm; Precision; Precision Agriculture; Weed Control; Wheat; Winter","Block modeling; Deep learning; DINO; Non-local block; Nonlocal; Precision Agriculture; Weed detection; Winter wheat; Winter wheat weed; YOLOv8; algorithm; precision; precision agriculture; weed control; wheat; winter","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 32371992 ), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation ( 2024A1515011902 ), Shenzhen Science and Technology Program ( JCYJ20210324102401005 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 32001424 ), and Shenzhen Science and Technology Program ( JCYJ20220818100408018 )","Alirezazadeh, Pendar, A comparative analysis of deep learning methods for weed classification of high-resolution UAV images, Journal of Plant Diseases and Protection, 131, 1, pp. 227-236, (2024); Bakhshipour, Adel, Evaluation of support vector machine and artificial neural networks in weed detection using shape features, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 145, pp. 153-160, (2018); Bastos, Leonardo Mendes, Winter Wheat Yield Response to Plant Density as a Function of Yield Environment and Tillering Potential: A Review and Field Studies, Frontiers in Plant Science, 11, (2020); Wheat Breeding, (1987); undefined, (2019); Align Detr Improving Detr with Simple Iou Aware Bce Loss, (2023); Arxiv, (2020); Chen, Jiqing, Weed detection in sesame fields using a YOLO model with an enhanced attention mechanism and feature fusion, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 202, (2022); Christensen, Svend, Site-specific weed control technologies, Weed Research, 49, 3, pp. 233-241, (2009); Dai, Jifeng, Deformable Convolutional Networks, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2017-October, pp. 764-773, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01681699","","CEAGE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205426157"

This is particularly important in applications that utilise existing, though limited, computational and data communication infrastructures. Furthermore, rural communities have growing concerns regarding the privacy, security, and ownership of the data produced within their agricultural fields. Load distribution in rural edge devices can enhance agricultural practices by improving resource usage, decision-making, and addressing network connectivity challenges. Managing resource utilisation in this way also improves economic investments made in managing and deploying edge devices in rural environments. In this work, we propose SHIELD, a security-aware load balancing framework, primarily designed for edge-based systems in rural areas. For handling environments with limited connectivity, SHIELD efficiently manages tasks and computational resources by categorising them into restricted, public and private, shared respectively. It also allocates tasks considering key performance factors such as completion time, resource utilisation, failure rate, and security. The framework is evaluated on a weed detection scenario in precision agriculture, using three federated learning (FL) variants (local model training, global model aggregation, and model prediction) with the ResNet-50 model trained on the DeepWeeds image classification dataset. The proposed framework also integrates encryption and task replication techniques for data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Experimental results show that SHIELD demonstrates an average of 23% (using Parsl), 29% (using OpenWhisk) improvement in failure rate and 18 s (Parsl), 13 s (OpenWhisk) average improvement in makespan compared to other task allocation approaches, such as secure variants of random, round robin, and least loaded. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Distributed Systems; Edge Computing; Internet Of Things; Load Balancing; Precision Agriculture; Classification (of Information); Cryptography; Decision Making; Edge Computing; Internet Of Things; Rural Areas; Data Generation; Distributed Systems; Failure Rate; Integrated Environment; Load Distributions; Load-balancing; Load-balancing Algorithm; Precision Agriculture; Resources Utilizations; Failure Analysis","Classification (of information); Cryptography; Decision making; Edge computing; Internet of things; Rural areas; Data generation; Distributed systems; Failure rate; Integrated environment; Load distributions; Load-Balancing; Load-balancing algorithm; Precision Agriculture; Resources utilizations; Failure analysis","","","","Carrer, Marcelo José, Precision agriculture adoption and technical efficiency: An analysis of sugarcane farms in Brazil, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 177, (2022); Affordable Artificial Intelligence Augmenting Farmer Knowledge with AI, (2023); undefined; Dumont, René, TYPES OF RURAL ECONOMY: Studies in World Agriculture, pp. 1-556, (2023); Expert Syst, (2023); Balmos, Andrew D., ISOBlue Avena: A Framework for Agricultural Edge Computing and Data Sovereignty, IEEE Micro, 42, 1, pp. 78-86, (2022); Kalyani, Yogeswaranathan, A systematic survey on the role of cloud, fog, and edge computing combination in smart agriculture, Sensors, 21, 17, (2021); AlZubi, Ahmad Ali, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things for Sustainable Farming and Smart Agriculture, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 78686-78692, (2023); Digital Technologies in Agriculture and Rural Areas, (2019); Sah Tyagi, Sumarga Kumar, An Intelligent and Optimal Resource Allocation Approach in Sensor Networks for Smart Agri-IoT, IEEE Sensors Journal, 21, 16, pp. 17439-17446, (2021)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","0167739X","","FGCSE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199311129"

This has led to increased generation of large volumes of data about fields and their crop yields which could be used to increase the environmental and financial performance for farmers. However, survey results show that cost and adaptability have been issues for many farmers in the UK and Germany that have held back such adoption. The LINKDAPA (LINKing multi-source Data for Adoption of Precision Agriculture) project's approach sought to minimise both concerns by creating a customisable web platform that incorporates both GNSS and VRT into one, easy to use, affordable option for farmers. The project developed an online cloud-based decision support tool which takes into account different fertiliser strategies based on novel algorithms using soil, historic yield and satellite data. Co-created by researchers, farmers and agricultural technology firms, the LINKDAPA approach offers both economical and easy to implement solutions for farm management to mitigate resource loss-ratios such as in fertiliser use, provide financial performance analyses, and multi-year graphical imagery for soil mapping. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithm; Arable Farming; Data Set; Gnss; Optimization; Precision Agriculture; Germany; United Kingdom","algorithm; arable farming; data set; GNSS; optimization; precision agriculture; Germany; United Kingdom","","","The research project reported here received co-funding from EIT Food, part of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, a body of the European Union, under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, the EU Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation.

The availability of Remote Sensing (RS) datasets and Machine Learning (ML) approaches improved the prediction of sugarcane crop yield on the local and global scales, but an additional effort on the plot scale prediction is required. Challenges for plot-level prediction include a high ratooning capacity of the sugarcane crop, the lack of high spatial resolution data during the critical growth stages, and the non-linear complexation of yield data. The principal objective of the study is to analyse the potential of a time series of high-resolution multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery along with three advanced ML techniques, namely Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Artificial Neural Network (NARX ANN) as a solution to the plot-level sugarcane yield prediction. An experimental sugarcane field containing 48 plots was selected, and UAV imagery was collected during the three consecutive cropping seasons' early and middle crop growth stages. Each dataset per growth stage was analyzed separately to predict the sugarcane crop yield in an attempt to discover how early the prediction of pre-harvest yield can be achieved. The datasets of the first two cropping seasons were trained and tested using the three ML techniques, utilizing 10-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting. The third cropping season dataset was then used to evaluate the reliability of the developed prediction models. The results show that the correlation of Vegetation Indices (VIs) with crop yield in the middle stage outperforms the early stage in all three ML models. Moreover, comparing these models indicates that the NARX ANN method outperformed the others in the middle stage with the highest correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.96 and the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.92 t/ha. It was followed by the SVR (R2 = 0.52, RMSE of 14.85 t/ha), which performed similarly to the RFR method (R2 = 0.48, RMSE = 11.20 t/ha). In conclusion, the best-suited model for predicting sugarcane yields during the middle growth stage is a NARX ANN model employing the Normalized Difference RedEdge (NDRE), which demonstrates the feasibility of the ML approaches to predict the plot level sugarcane yield at a specific period of growth as they are less sensitive to the inconsistency of data collection times. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Artificial Neural Network (narx Ann); Random Forest Regression (rfr); Sugarcane Yield Prediction; Support Vector Machine (svm); Antennas; Crops; Food Supply; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning Systems; Mean Square Error; Random Forests; Remote Sensing; Support Vector Regression; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Vectors; Auto-regressive; Crop Yield; Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Artificial Neural Network; Random Forest Regression; Sugarcane Yield; Sugarcane Yield Prediction; Support Vector Machine; Support Vectors Machine; Yield Prediction; Neural Networks; Aerial Photography; Crop Yield; Experimental Study; Food Security; Machine Learning; Multispectral Image; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Spatial Resolution; Sugar; Support Vector Machine; Unmanned Vehicle; Australia; Bundaberg; Queensland","Antennas; Crops; Food supply; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Mean square error; Random forests; Remote sensing; Support vector regression; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vectors; Auto-regressive; Crop yield; Nonlinear autoregressive exogenous artificial neural network; Random forest regression; Sugarcane yield; Sugarcane yield prediction; Support vector machine; Support vectors machine; Yield prediction; Neural networks; aerial photography; crop yield; experimental study; food security; machine learning; multispectral image; precision agriculture; remote sensing; spatial resolution; sugar; support vector machine; unmanned vehicle; Australia; Bundaberg; Queensland","","","","undefined, (2021); Rahman, Muhammad Moshiur, Integrating landsat-8 and sentinel-2 time series data for yield prediction of sugarcane crops at the block level, Remote Sensing, 12, 8, (2020); Som-Ard, Jaturong, Pre-harvest Sugarcane Yield Estimation Using UAV-Based RGB Images and Ground Observation, Sugar Tech, 20, 6, pp. 645-657, (2018); Bégué, Agnès, Spatio-temporal variability of sugarcane fields and recommendations for yield forecast using NDVI, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 31, 20, pp. 5391-5407, (2010); Reynolds, Curt A., Estimating crop yields and production by integrating the FAO Crop Specific Water Balance model with real-time satellite data and ground-based ancillary data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 21, 18, pp. 3487-3508, (2000); Morel, Julien, Toward a satellite-based system of sugarcane yield estimation and forecasting in smallholder farming conditions: A case study on reunion island, Remote Sensing, 6, 7, pp. 6620-6635, (2014); Advances in Remote Sensing, (2016); Mulianga, Betty A., Forecasting regional sugarcane yield based on time integral and spatial aggregation of MODIS NDVI, Remote Sensing, 5, 5, pp. 2184-2199, (2013); Aghighi, Hossein, Machine Learning Regression Techniques for the Silage Maize Yield Prediction Using Time-Series Images of Landsat 8 OLI, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 11, 12, pp. 4563-4577, (2018); Xu, Jingxian, Estimation of sugarcane yield using a machine learning approach based on uav-lidar data, Remote Sensing, 12, 17, pp. 1-13, (2020)","","China Agricultural University","","","","","","20970153; 22143173","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170415324"

The advancement of deep learning algorithms in precision agriculture holds the key to enabling the early classification of plant diseases, thereby leading to enhanced crop yields and ultimately stabilizing food security. In the coarse-grained label discrimination task of weak supervision learning, high-quality semantic features contain abundant semantic description information, which plays a crucial role in constructing a precise description of plant disease discrimination in tanglesome field circumstances and directly influences the performance of neural networks. Thus, a multiattention IBN anti-aliasing neural network (MAIANet) was proposed to improve the classification accuracy of cassava leaf disease classification by improving the feature quality in the coarseness label classification task. The proposed MAIANet neural network includes two innovative approaches. First, the multiattention method was designed to scale the feature signals twice to adjust the angular frequency of the feature signals in the residual branch for optimal feature fitting within the residual unit. Second, the anti-aliasing block extracts the high-frequency component feature and optimizes the quantization result of the pooling operation to depress the aliasing signal in the down-sampled feature maps. When the proposed method was tested and validated on the cassava dataset, the results showed that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method significantly improved, with an accuracy of 95.83 %, a loss of 1.720, and an F1-score of 0.9585, outperforming V2-ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B5, RepVGG-B3g4, and AlexNet with significant margins. Based on the above experimental results, the proposed algorithm is suitable for classifying cassava leaf diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disease Classification; Feature Fitting Optimization; Multiattention; Quantization Optimization; Aliasing; Disease Classification; Feature Fitting Optimization; Leaf Disease; Multiattention; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Quantisation; Quantization Optimization; Cassava; Genetic Algorithm; Optimization; Precision Agriculture; Signal Processing","Aliasing; Disease classification; Feature fitting optimization; Leaf disease; Multiattention; Neural-networks; Optimisations; Quantisation; Quantization optimization; cassava; genetic algorithm; optimization; precision agriculture; signal processing","","","","Abadi, Martín, TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning, pp. 265-283, (2016); Abdullahi, Ismail, Effects of cassava genotype, climate and the Bemisia Tabaci vector population on the development of African cassava mosaic geminivirus (ACMV), Acta Agronomica Hungarica, 51, 1, pp. 37-46, (2003); Azeroual, Otmane, Data wrangling in database systems: Purging of dirty data, Data, 5, 2, pp. 1-9, (2020); undefined, (2022); Chang, Dongliang, The Devil is in the Channels: Mutual-Channel Loss for Fine-Grained Image Classification, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 29, pp. 4683-4695, (2020); Chen, Zhuohang, Imbalance fault diagnosis under long-tailed distribution: Challenges, solutions and prospects, Knowledge-Based Systems, 258, (2022); Chen, Junde, Weakly-supervised learning method for the recognition of potato leaf diseases, Artificial Intelligence Review, 56, 8, pp. 7985-8002, (2023); Chisenga, Shadrack Mubanga, Progress in research and applications of cassava flour and starch: a review, Journal of Food Science and Technology, 56, 6, pp. 2799-2813, (2019); Choi, Seokeon, Meta Batch-Instance Normalization for Generalizable Person Re-Identification, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3424-3434, (2021); Chollet, François, Xception: Deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017-January, pp. 1800-1807, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01681699","","CEAGE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201626889"

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods inevitably accumulate drift on exploratory trajectories and primarily rely on place revisiting and loop closing to keep a bounded global localization error. Loop closure techniques are significantly challenging in agricultural fields, as the local visual appearance of different views is very similar and might change easily due to weather effects. A suitable alternative in practice is to employ global sensor positioning systems jointly with the rest of the robot sensors. In this paper we propose and implement the fusion of global navigation satellite system (GNSS), stereo views, and inertial measurements for localization purposes. Specifically, we incorporate, in a tightly coupled manner, GNSS measurements into the stereo-inertial ORB-SLAM3 pipeline. We thoroughly evaluate our implementation in the sequences of the Rosario data set, recorded by an autonomous robot in soybean fields, and our own in-house data. Our data includes measurements from a conventional GNSS, rarely included in evaluations of state-of-the-art approaches. We characterize the performance of GNSS-stereo-inertial SLAM in this application case, reporting pose error reductions between 10% and 30% compared to visual–inertial and loosely coupled GNSS-stereo-inertial baselines. In addition to such analysis, we also release the code of our implementation as open source. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Robotics; Gnss-stereo-inertial Slam; Precision Agriculture; Agricultural Robots; Farms; Global Positioning System; Open Systems; Agricultural Robotics; Field Robot; Global Navigation Satellite System-stereo-inertial Simultaneous Localization And Mapping; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Highly Accurate; Localisation Systems; Localization Method; Precision Agriculture; Simultaneous Localization And Mapping; Task Demand; Precision Agriculture","Agricultural robots; Farms; Global positioning system; Open systems; Agricultural robotics; Field robot; Global navigation satellite system-stereo-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Highly accurate; Localisation Systems; Localization method; Precision Agriculture; Simultaneous localization and mapping; Task demand; Precision agriculture","","","This work was partially supported by CONICET (Argentina) (PUE 0015\u20102016), by the Santa Fe Province (Argentina) Government under Grant PEICID\u20102021\u2010170, by the Spanish Government under Grants PGC2018\u2010096367\u2010B\u2010I00 and PID2021\u2010127685NB\u2010I00, and by the Aragon Government under Grant DGA T45 17R/FSE.","Auat Cheein, Fernando, Agricultural robotics: Unmanned robotic service units in agricultural tasks, IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine, 7, 3, pp. 48-58, (2013); Bac, C.

Despite improvements in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they lack the granularity and efficiency needed for PA. Data-driven models offer a promising alternative by integrating predictive capabilities closer to IoT edge data sources, but their efficacy requires evaluation. Here, this paper evaluates six models from three data-driven eras (statistical, machine learning, and deep learning) using agrometeorological data from an Automatic Weather Station (AWS) in Sidi Rahal, East Marrakech, central Morocco, covering 2013–2020 at half-hour intervals, including air temperature, solar radiation, and relative humidity. First, the data is quality-controlled through imputation using ERA5-Land. Then, the dataset was split into training (2013–2019) and evaluation (2020) sets, with validation horizons of 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week. Statistical models generally perform well in air temperature forecasting, occasionally surpassing other models. However, the Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN) consistently demonstrates superior performance for challenging variables, balancing low RMSE and high R2 across various horizons, with some exceptions. Specifically, for relative humidity, the linear regression model achieves slightly lower RMSE (3,96% and 6,05%) compared to TCNN (4,00% and 6,79%) for 1 day and 3 days, respectively. Additionally, CatBoost outperforms TCNN for 1-week forecasts. In terms of training time, the Transformer requires the longest, followed by AutoARIMA and CatBoost. Uncertainty analysis of stochastic models using solar radiation showed the stable performance of TCNN with 0,80 and 0,01 for the RMSE and R2 standard deviations, respectively. Considering the trade-off between performance, training time, and capturing complex relationships, TCNN emerges as the optimal choice. ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD and Mann-Whitney U statistical tests also confirmed TCNN’s performance. Finally, a comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) reveals TCNN’s clear superiority in all metrics, particularly evident for the RMSE of 3 days air temperature forecasts (TCNN: 1,96 °C, GFS: 3,59 °C). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Statistical Modeling; Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks; Time Series Modeling; Transformer; Weather Forecasting; Benchmarking; Damage Detection; Data Quality; Decision Making; Deep Neural Networks; Electric Transformer Testing; Fertilizers; Linear Regression; Time Series; Air Temperature; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Performance; Precision Agriculture; Statistic Modeling; Temporal Convolutional Neural Network; Times Series Models; Training Time; Transformer; Weather Forecasting; Agricultural Management; Agricultural Practice; Architectural Design; Artificial Neural Network; Precision Agriculture; Statistical Analysis; Weather Forecasting; Marrakech [(cty) Marrakech-safi]; Marrakech-safi; Morocco","Benchmarking; Damage detection; Data quality; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Electric transformer testing; Fertilizers; Linear regression; Time series; Air temperature; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Performance; Precision Agriculture; Statistic modeling; Temporal convolutional neural network; Times series models; Training time; Transformer; Weather forecasting; agricultural management; agricultural practice; architectural design; artificial neural network; precision agriculture; statistical analysis; weather forecasting; Marrakech [(CTY) Marrakech-Safi]; Marrakech-Safi; Morocco","","","This study was supported by and conducted within the Center for Remote Sensing Applications (CRSA) ( https://crsa.um6p.ma ), at the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) in Morocco in the context of the FIRMA project.

In the field of path planning, the evaluation of planned trajectories is based on GPS data. However, due to the unstructured operating environment, the existing methods for evaluating the efficiency of actual operating trajectories are not yet fully developed. In the context of agricultural machinery GPS trajectories, headland turning of the field is considered a non-working segment, which related to evaluation standard for trajectory planning efficiency in many studies. This paper proposes a processing method that evaluates GPS trajectories efficiency. A turning extraction algorithm based on changes in the angle of the agricultural machine's driving direction is proposed. The turning parts of the raw GPS data are preliminarily extracted, and a method for constructing a turning extraction dataset is presented. Then a multi-layer perceptron model for straight-turn binary classification training using K-Fold cross validation is designed and applied, which can implement robust segmentation of agricultural machinery trajectory points in actual environment. Two methods for building different turning classification datasets are proposed, and turning classification is performed using two deep learning models. A convolutional neural network-based model classifies headland turnings by their normalized sequences’ visualization images, while a long short-term memory network-based model utilizes the trajectory point sequences. The CNN-based model performs relatively better than the LSTM-based model. Finally, some commonly used GPS trajectory efficiency evaluation standards in the field of agricultural machinery path planning are combined to evaluate the efficiency of actual GPS trajectories of agricultural machinery. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Network; Gps Trajectory Processing; Headland Turning Classification; Headland Turning Extraction; Long Short-term Memory Network; Multi-layer Perceptron; Agriculture; Brain; Classification (of Information); Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Efficiency; Extraction; Global Positioning System; Motion Planning; Multilayer Neural Networks; Network Layers; Trajectories; Trees (mathematics); Convolutional Neural Network; Evaluation Standard; Gps Data; Gps Trajectory Processing; Headland Turning Classification; Headland Turning Extraction; Long Short-term Memory Network; Memory Network; Multilayers Perceptrons; Trajectory Points; Long Short-term Memory; Algorithm; Artificial Neural Network; Gps; Machinery; Precision Agriculture; Visualization","Agriculture; Brain; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Efficiency; Extraction; Global positioning system; Motion planning; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Trajectories; Trees (mathematics); Convolutional neural network; Evaluation standard; GPS data; GPS trajectory processing; Headland turning classification; Headland turning extraction; Long short-term memory network; Memory network; Multilayers perceptrons; Trajectory points; Long short-term memory; algorithm; artificial neural network; GPS; machinery; precision agriculture; visualization","","","This work was supported by Key R & D projects in Zhejiang Province(2022C02048).","Abbaskhah, Ahmad, Optimization of horizontal axis wind turbine performance with the dimpled blades by using CNN and MLP models, Ocean Engineering, 276, (2023); Abriha, Dávid, Smaller is better?

One of the major concerns associated with Fusarium spp. is their ability to produce mycotoxins. Mycotoxin contamination in small grain cereals is a risk to human and animal health and leads to major economic losses. A reliable site-specific precise Fusarium spp. infection early warning model is, therefore, needed to ensure food and feed safety by the early detection of contamination hotspots, enabling effective and efficient fungicide applications, and providing FHB prevention management advice. Such precision farming techniques contribute to environmentally friendly production and sustainable agriculture. This study developed a predictive model, Sága, for on-site FHB detection in wheat using imaging spectroscopy and deep learning. Data were collected from an experimental field in 2021 including (1) an experimental field inoculated with Fusarium spp. (52.5 m × 3 m) and (2) a control field (52.5 m × 3 m) not inoculated with Fusarium spp. and sprayed with fungicides. Imaging spectroscopy data (hyperspectral images) were collected from both the experimental and control fields with the ground truth of Fusarium-infected ear and healthy ear, respectively. Deep learning approaches (pretrained YOLOv5 and DeepMAC on Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) dataset) were used to segment wheat ears and XGBoost was used to analyze the hyperspectral information related to the wheat ears and make predictions of Fusarium-infected wheat ear and healthy wheat ear. The results showed that deep learning methods can automatically detect and segment the ears of wheat by applying pretrained models. The predictive model can accurately detect infected areas in a wheat field, achieving mean accuracy and F1 scores exceeding 89%.

Leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles, we can efficiently acquire high-resolution spatiotemporal samples by utilizing remote sensors. However, non-linear relationships among data features, localized within specific subgroups, frequently emerge in agricultural data. Interpreting these complex patterns requires sophisticated analysis due to the presence of noise, high variability, and non-stationarity behavior in the collected samples. Here, we introduce Local Biplot, a methodological framework tailored for discerning meaningful data patterns in non-stationary contexts for precision agriculture. Local Biplot relies on the well-known uniform manifold approximation and projection method, such as UMAP, and local affine transformations to codify non-stationary and non-linear data patterns while maintaining interpretability. This lets us find important clusters for transformation and projection within a single global axis pair. Hence, our framework encompasses variable and observational contributions within individual clusters. At the same time, we provide a relevance analysis strategy to help explain why those clusters exist, facilitating the understanding of data dynamics while favoring interpretability. We demonstrated our method’s capabilities through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, covering scenarios involving grass and rice crops. Moreover, we use random forest and linear regression models to predict water status variables from our Local Biplot-based feature ranking and clusters. Our findings revealed enhanced clustering and prediction capability while emphasizing the importance of input features in precision agriculture. As a result, Local Biplot is a useful tool to visualize, analyze, and compare the intricate underlying patterns and internal structures of complex agricultural datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biplot; Precision Agriculture; Relevance Analysis; Remote Sensing; Umap; Antennas; Crops; Forestry; Linear Transformations; Metadata; Precision Agriculture; Regression Analysis; Aerial Vehicle; Biplots; Data Patterns; Interpretability; Nonstationary; Precision Agriculture; Relevance Analysis; Remote-sensing; Umap; Water Status; Remote Sensing","Antennas; Crops; Forestry; Linear transformations; Metadata; Precision agriculture; Regression analysis; Aerial vehicle; Biplots; Data patterns; Interpretability; Nonstationary; Precision Agriculture; Relevance analysis; Remote-sensing; UMAP; Water status; Remote sensing","","","","Arouna, Alfassassi, Water Management for Sustainable Irrigation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)

The United Nations highlights that only about 31 percent of the population is not characterized by water stress, meaning that the world's freshwater resources are unevenly distributed and unsustainably managed. This phenomenon is both natural and man-made, as the human footprint is linked to many disciplines, with the largest impact coming from the agricultural sector. Scientific literature highlights how 4.0 technologies are the key drivers to reduce this sector's impact on valuable resources, such as water and soil. Based on these premises, the proposed work aims at improving the irrigation management in agriculture by implementing a three-layer architecture system to optimize water consumption and prevent soil percolation, by avoiding situations where the soil moisture exceeds its capacity point. To achieve this, experimental activities allow the evaluation of the soil capacity point and thus the definition of a confidence interval to guide watering decisions. The latter interval, soil and environmental data, and three-day weather forecasts are aggregate to create a consistent dataset for training and testing three different machine learning algorithms based on a classification problem to predict the state of the irrigation network. As a result, the implemented multi-layer perceptron neural network, support vector machine, and k-neighbors classifier achieved an accuracy of nearly 99%. Despite this, the neural network produced superior decision region boundaries, resulting in fewer false predictions. A Monte Carlo simulation was then applied to evaluate the water and energy savings, which were up to 27 % and 57 %, respectively. In summary, the predictive algorithm-based irrigation management system is a cost-effective solution for optimizing water management in agriculture that it is truly scalable to any crop by assessing the appropriate soil capacity level. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Machine Learning; Precision Agriculture; Predictive Algorithm; Sustainable Farming; Water Management; Classification (of Information); Cost Effectiveness; Energy Conservation; Farms; Forecasting; Intelligent Systems; Irrigation; Learning Algorithms; Monte Carlo Methods; Precision Agriculture; Soil Moisture; Solvents; Statistical Tests; Support Vector Machines; Water Management; Global Issues; Irrigation Management Systems; Machine-learning; Precision Agriculture; Predictive Algorithms; Pressung; Sustainable Farming; Water Consumption; Water Scarcity; Waters Managements; Multilayer Neural Networks; Algorithm; Alternative Agriculture; Irrigation System; Machine Learning; Percolation; Precision Agriculture; Prediction; Resource Scarcity; Soil Moisture; Water Management; Water Use Efficiency; Argentina; Monaco; Monte; Monte Carlo","Classification (of information); Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Farms; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Irrigation; Learning algorithms; Monte Carlo methods; Precision agriculture; Soil moisture; Solvents; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Water management; Global issues; Irrigation management systems; Machine-learning; Precision Agriculture; Predictive algorithms; Pressung; Sustainable Farming; Water consumption; Water scarcity; Waters managements; Multilayer neural networks; algorithm; alternative agriculture; irrigation system; machine learning; percolation; precision agriculture; prediction; resource scarcity; soil moisture; water management; water use efficiency; Argentina; Monaco; Monte; Monte Carlo","","","This study was carried out within the Agritech National Research Center and received funding from the European Union Next-Generation EU (PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPRESA E RESILIENZA (PNRR) \u2013 MISSIONE 4 COMPONENTE 2, INVESTIMENTO 1.4 \u2013 D.D. 1032 17/06/2022, CN00000022).

Weeds compete fiercely for resources, which affects soybean yields. Because of the progressive enhancement of weed resistance to herbicides and the quickly increasing cost of manual weeding, mechanical weed control is becoming the preferred method of weed control. Mechanical weed control finds it difficult to remove intra-row weeds due to the lack of rapid and precise weed/soybean detection and location technology. Rhodamine B (Rh-B) is a systemic crop compound that can be absorbed by soybeans which fluoresces under a specific excitation light. The purpose of this study is to combine systemic crop compounds and computer vision technology for the identification and localization of soybeans in the field. The fluorescence distribution properties of systemic crop compounds in soybeans and their effects on plant growth were explored. The fluorescence was mainly concentrated in soybean cotyledons treated with Rh-B. After a comparison of soybean seedlings treated with nine groups of rhodamine B solutions at different concentrations ranging from 0 to 1440 ppm, the soybeans treated with 180 ppm Rh-B for 24 h received the recommended dosage, resulting in significant fluorescence that did not affect crop growth. Increasing the Rh-B solutions reduced crop biomass, while prolonged treatment times reduced seed germination. The fluorescence produced lasted for 20 days, ensuring a stable signal in the early stages of growth. Additionally, a precise inter-row soybean plant location system based on a fluorescence imaging system with a 96.7% identification accuracy, determined on 300 datasets, was proposed. This article further confirms the potential of crop signaling technology to assist machines in achieving crop identification and localization in the field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer Vision; Precision Agriculture; Rapid Plant Detection; System Crop Signal; Rhodamine B; Rhodamine B; Rhodamines; Computer Vision; Fluorescence Imaging; Herbicides; Precision Agriculture; Seed; Soybean Oil; Weed Control; Automatic Localization; Localisation; Mechanical; Multiview Imaging; Plant Detections; Precision Agriculture; Rapid Plant Detection; Rhodamine-b; Soybean Seedlings; System Crop Signal; Crops; Rhodamine; Rhodamine B; Chemistry; Crop; Drug Effect; Fluorescence; Germination; Growth, Development And Aging; Metabolism; Physiology; Seedling; Soybean; Weed; Crops, Agricultural; Fluorescence; Germination; Glycine Max; Plant Weeds; Rhodamines; Seedlings","Computer vision; Fluorescence imaging; Herbicides; Precision agriculture; Seed; Soybean oil; Weed control; Automatic localization; Localisation; Mechanical; Multiview imaging; Plant detections; Precision Agriculture; Rapid plant detection; Rhodamine-B; Soybean seedlings; System crop signal; Crops; rhodamine; rhodamine B; chemistry; crop; drug effect; fluorescence; germination; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiology; seedling; soybean; weed; Crops, Agricultural; Fluorescence; Germination; Glycine max; Plant Weeds; Rhodamines; Seedlings","","rhodamine B, 81-88-9; rhodamine B; Rhodamines","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 32101610.","Dos Santos Ferreira, Alessandro, Weed detection in soybean crops using ConvNets, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 143, pp. 314-324, (2017); Ahmed, Sharif I., Integrated weed management in transplanted rice: Options for addressing labor constraints and improving farmers' income in Bangladesh, Weed Technology, 35, 5, pp. 697-709, (2021); Bakhshipour, Adel, Weed segmentation using texture features extracted from wavelet sub-images, Biosystems Engineering, 157, pp. 1-12, (2017); Chang, Chungliang, Mechanical control with a deep learning method for precise weeding on a farm, Agriculture (Switzerland), 11, 11, (2021); Dai, Xiang, Analysis of the variability of pesticide concentration downstream of inline mixers for direct nozzle injection systems, Biosystems Engineering, 180, pp. 59-69, (2019); Fan, Xiangpeng, Deep learning based weed detection and target spraying robot system at seedling stage of cotton field, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 214, (2023); Fennimore, Steven A., Technology for automation of weed control in specialty crops, Weed Technology, 30, 4, pp. 823-837, (2016); Gaur, Manas, Semantics of the Black-Box: Can Knowledge Graphs Help Make Deep Learning Systems More Interpretable and Explainable?, IEEE Internet Computing, 25, 1, pp. 51-59, (2021); Grassini, Patricio, Soybean, pp. 282-319, (2020); Hasan, A.

In response to this issue, novel agricultural solutions are emerging, leveraging the synergy of deep learning and computer vision technique for early disease detection. Recently, researchers have embraced vision Transformers for plant disease identification. While this approach has shown promising results, it also presents challenges, such as high computational costs and low inductive bias for locality. In response to these challenges, we suggest a hybrid model with fewer trainable parameters, combining the power of vision Transformers with the capabilities of convolutional layers to extract relevant local features, thereby enhancing the performance of ViT. Additionally, we modify the ViT architecture to minimize the number of trainable parameters. We performed experiments on a public dataset of potatoes to assess the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid model. According to the experimental results obtained, the proposed model achieved a test accuracy of 98.27%, surpassing the original ViT and two leading CNN architectures, namely VGG16 and ResNet50. Our model has fewer parameters than the original ViT, with a reduction rate of 49%. This reduction helps to minimize the computational and memory costs of our model. Additionally, due to this parameter reduction, our proposed model requires half of training time compared to the original ViT. All these findings make our proposed model more adaptable for smart agriculture applications, particularly in real-time detection of plant diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer Vision; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Image Processing; Intelligent System; Machine Learning; Plant Disease Detection; Precision Agriculture; Smart Monitoring; Vision Transformers; Machine Vision; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Disease Detection; Images Processing; Machine-learning; Plant Disease; Plant Disease Detection; Precision Agriculture; Smart Monitoring; Vision Transformer; Distribution Transformers","Machine vision; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Disease detection; Images processing; Machine-learning; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; Precision Agriculture; Smart monitoring; Vision transformer; Distribution transformers","","","","Parez, Sana, Visual Intelligence in Precision Agriculture: Exploring Plant Disease Detection via Efficient Vision Transformers, Sensors, 23, 15, (2023); Thakur, Poornima Singh, Vision transformer meets convolutional neural network for plant disease classification, Ecological Informatics, 77, (2023); Li, Xiaopeng, Transformer helps identify kiwifruit diseases in complex natural environments, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 200, (2022); Salamai, Abdullah Ali, Lesion-aware visual transformer network for Paddy diseases detection in precision agriculture, European Journal of Agronomy, 148, (2023); Mohanty, Sharada Prasanna, Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection, Frontiers in Plant Science, 7, September, (2016); Türkoǧlu, Muammer, PlantDiseaseNet: convolutional neural network ensemble for plant disease and pest detection, Signal, Image and Video Processing, 16, 2, pp. 301-309, (2022); Biswas, Barsha, A Review of Convolutional Neural Network-based Approaches for Disease Detection in Plants, pp. 514-518, (2023); Nigam, Sapna, Deep transfer learning model for disease identification in wheat crop, Ecological Informatics, 75, (2023); Berka, Anas, CactiViT: Image-based smartphone application and transformer network for diagnosis of cactus cochineal, Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture, 9, pp. 12-21, (2023); Thai, Huy Tan, Artificial Cognition for Early Leaf Disease Detection using Vision Transformers, International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications, 2021-October, pp. 33-38, (2021)","","Association for Computing Machinery","","7th International Conference on Networking, Intelligent Systems and Security, NISS 2024","","Meknes","201803","","9798400709296; 9798400716805; 9798400708428; 9798400709579","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202617194"

Existing path planning approaches are constrained to a 2D plane, disregarding the impact of terrain factors on navigation tasks. Furthermore, these methods generate non-global paths, as evidenced by their inability to accommodate the headland turning area while performing path planning based on the actual crop growth in the farmland. Low-altitude remote sensing technology, characterized by its high spatial resolution, timely data acquisition, and strong terrain perception, holds great potential for application in autonomous navigation. This study aims to integrate low-altitude remote sensing technology with path-planning tasks for agricultural vehicles by constructing oblique photography models of fields. The objective is to achieve global 3D path planning leveraging advanced methodologies rooted in deep learning and image processing. Four main steps were included in the proposed method. Low-altitude remote sensing models of field blocks were constructed first. Secondly, the models were converted to image patches for dataset establishment. Thirdly, primary crop row identification was conducted by semantic segmentation. Finally, global 3D paths covering the farmland and headland areas were generated. Tea fields in hilly areas were used to test the algorithm. Experiments revealed that the proposed method could be adapted to different field shapes, row numbers, row spacing, and vehicle turning radii.

However, soil classification is time-consuming, laborious, and costly through the traditional methods. Recently, artificial intelligence-based methods, especially machine learning, have played a vigorous role in soil classification and its mapping. However, machine learning still makes exterior soil type classification and its mapping difficult due to various features and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. Therefore, the present study has tried to determine soil properties and sort accordingly using hyperspectral datasets and machine learning methods. We used field spectra generated by ASD Field Spec 4 device and satellite image. The proposed approach has identified three prominent soil types, Regur soil, Lateritic soil, and sand dunes according to soil taxonomy, with more than 95% success rate using satellite hyperspectral image and machine learning models. Thus, the outcome of the present study can be effectively utilized in healthy agricultural practices to increase global food production. In addition, the suggested strategy can be used in precision agriculture and environmental management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Machine Learning-enabled Soil Classification; Precision Farming; Regur Soil; Soil Analysis; Soil Spectral Library; Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning; Precision Agriculture; Soil Property; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Spectral Analysis","artificial intelligence; machine learning; precision agriculture; soil property; spatiotemporal analysis; spectral analysis","","","The authors would like to thank USGS for supplying the satellite data.","Anne, Naveen J.P., Modeling soil parameters using hyperspectral image reflectance insubtropical coastal wetlands, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 33, 1, pp. 47-56, (2014); Ground Water Information Aurangabad District Maharashtra Central Region Nagpur, (2013); Gene Tech Books, (2007); Barman, Utpal, Soil texture classification using multi class support vector machine, Information Processing in Agriculture, 7, 2, pp. 318-332, (2020); Methods Manual Soil Testing in India, (2011); Bernstein, Lawrence S., Quick atmospheric correction code: Algorithm description and recent upgrades, Optical Engineering, 51, 11, (2012); Bhat, Showkat Ahmad, Soil suitability classification for crop selection in precision agriculture using GBRT-based hybrid DNN surrogate models, Ecological Informatics, 75, (2023); Bhattacharya, Biswa, Machine learning in soil classification, Neural Networks, 19, 2, pp. 186-195, (2006); Applied and Environmental Soil Science, (2011); Geomatics Landmanagement and Landscape, (2022)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","18669298; 1866928X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181255563"

The combination of a CNN, which possesses knowledge, with an SVM greatly enhances its ability to detect root rot. It possesses great strength, exhibits high adaptability, and demonstrates exceptional speed in task execution. The test results indicate that Cotton, a significant component of global agriculture, is currently confronted with a persistent issue caused by detrimental root rot. The cause of this issue is Phymatotrichopsis omnivora, which has the potential to negatively impact productivity if not well managed. Effectively managing illnesses relies on meticulous and prompt attention to the severity of root rot. Executing this challenging undertaking requires innovative concepts to achieve success. This study used a mixed model as a response. The method combines the properties of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to develop a sophisticated approach for quantifying the severity of cotton root rot infections.

Nevertheless the agricultural sector encounters significant obstacles in the shape of many illnesses that possess the potential to cause severe damage to crop productivity and jeopardize the availability of food resources. The proposed work endeavors to undertake a thorough investigation to tackle these issues by creating a resilient system for detecting diseases and classifying rice plants into multiple categories. Rice farming is faced with several frequent illnesses, each possessing distinct characteristics and exerting a specific impact on the health of the crop. The diseases encompassing rice blast, rice blight, hispa disease, and rice stem rot disease are widely recognized for their significant capacity to case extensive harm. Differentiating these illnesses from healthy rice plants is a procedure that requires significant labor and is susceptible to errors when conducted manually. To address these problems, the suggested study has carefully assembled a dataset consisting of high-resolution photos of rice plants. These images encompass a range of growth phases and indications of diseases. By utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) methodologies, the proposed work developed an advanced image processing model that exhibits the ability to classify rice plants into five discrete categories: healthy, rice blast, rice blight, hispa disease, and rice stem rot disease, without the need for manual intervention. The presented research encompasses not only the construction of a precise classification model but also explores the practical consequences of early illness detection in the context of rice farming. The experimental findings yielded highly encouraging results, as our model had an exceptional accuracy rate of 97.21%. The practical implications of our research extend far beyond the boundaries of the laboratory.

The sophisticated classification model AppleDiseaseNet-B7, known for its efficiency and outstanding performance, was created using the EfficientNetB7 architecture and is presented in this paper. The model improves its feature extraction capabilities by utilizing pretrained weights from ImageNet, which makes it a good fit for differentiating between various apple leaf diseases. AppleDiseaseNet-B7 incorporates numerous unique layers intended to increase classification precision. A Global Average Pooling layer streamlines feature maps, complicated patterns are captured by a dense layer with ReLU activation, overfitting is reduced by a dropout layer, and class prediction is accomplished by a final dense layer with softmax activation. The model's resilience is further increased using thorough data preparation, and augmentation approaches from the PlantVillage and Kaggle Apple Leaf Disease datasets. A comprehensive comparison is made between AppleDiseaseNet-B7's performance and other well-known models, including DenseNet121, ResNet50, and AlexNet. The analysis shows that AppleDiseaseNet-B7 regularly performs better than comparable models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, among other criteria. This comparison demonstrates how well AppleDiseaseNet-B7 performs in classifying apple leaf diseases, providing a reliable and effective method for managing and detecting agricultural diseases.

The study suggests a new way to determine whether a farm is suitable for a given crop by combining several machine learning algorithms, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (RBMs). Our objective is to combine these models so that we can better understand the patterns in agricultural data that are influenced by multiple variables, including weather, soil, crop yields, and other environmental factors. For the purpose of handling consecutive data and predicting future climatic trends that affect farming suitability, our long short-term memory (LSTM) model is designed. By expertly analysing patterns in satellite pictures and other spatial data, the CNN component assesses land qualities. Lastly, important factors influencing agricultural production are extracted using the RBM's feature learning abilities. Our integrated model was trained using a massive dataset collected from various agro-climatic zones. How well the model projected, given both present and future conditions, whether a plot of land would be appropriate for a specific crop was used to evaluate its effectiveness. The results demonstrate that our technique can reliably forecast which farms would be the best fit.

This project looks forward to providing insights to maximize agricultural practices and allow data-driven decision-making in rice cultivation. This is in line with how well these disparate machine learning models can predict rice crop production when measured against precision, accuracy, recall, and F1 score. To some extent, this is evident, as this study found that the machine learning models can predict yield quite satisfactorily, of which the model Random Forest performs very well in terms of precision and accuracy. Among them were the exactitude of sensor data and the algorithm selection, along with subsequent model assessment, refinement, and the ingression of great datasets inclusive of a broader set of environmental characteristics and crop yields - that were considered to be crucial in improving the precision of yield prediction algorithms. Additionally, the use of machine learning in farming has a number of benefits, such as enabling farmers to make decisions about crop management, irrigation, and optimization of yield. Combining machine learning methodologies with sensor technology can optimize resource allocation, save water, and improve overall agricultural productivity.

It is the backbone of the global economy, and its success is contingent primarily on the availability of water. The growing population in coming decades is probably going to boost this demand. It is a must to use new strategies that optimizes the water quantity required for irrigation in order to meet this sustainable demand. However, only watering is not sufficient for optimal plant growth. For overall plant health monitoring a data monitoring and estimation for approximating the plant growth is required. With the aid of global and local control, crop productivity can be made and adaptive soil moisture (SM) prediction model can control the required water and nutrients to be supplied to it. Developing the perfect model for SM prediction can be difficult, though, because of the many structural features and climatic variables involved.

The experiments showed that such heterogeneous ensembles outperform other techniques and offer a high level of model flexibility. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Ensemble; Hyperspectral Imaging; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing; Soil Analysis; Adversarial Machine Learning; Contrastive Learning; Deep Learning; Federated Learning; Hyperspectral Imaging; Ensemble; Hyper-spectral Imageries; Hyperspectral; Machine Learning Models; Machine-learning; Precision Agriculture; Remote-sensing; Soil Analysis; Soil Parameters","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Deep learning; Federated learning; Hyperspectral imaging; Ensemble; Hyper-spectral imageries; HyperSpectral; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Precision Agriculture; Remote-sensing; Soil analysis; Soil parameters","","","","Talaviya, Tanha, Implementation of artificial intelligence in agriculture for optimisation of irrigation and application of pesticides and herbicides, Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture, 4, pp. 58-73, (2020); Di Gennaro, Salvatore Filippo, Spectral Comparison of UAV-Based Hyper and Multispectral Cameras for Precision Viticulture, Remote Sensing, 14, 3, (2022); Lu, Bing, Recent advances of hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture, Remote Sensing, 12, 16, (2020); Wang, Sheng, Using soil library hyperspectral reflectance and machine learning to predict soil organic carbon: Assessing potential of airborne and spaceborne optical soil sensing, Remote Sensing of Environment, 271, (2022); Sun, Weiwei, Hyperspectral band selection: A review, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine, 7, 2, pp. 118-139, (2019); Ribalta Lorenzo, Pablo, Hyperspectral Band Selection Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 42384-42403, (2020); Nalepa, Jakub, Transfer Learning for Segmenting Dimensionally Reduced Hyperspectral Images, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 17, 7, pp. 1228-1232, (2020); Jia, Sen, A survey: Deep learning for hyperspectral image classification with few labeled samples, Neurocomputing, 448, pp. 179-204, (2021); Hang, Renlong, Hyperspectral Image Classification with Attention-Aided CNNs, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 59, 3, pp. 2281-2293, (2021); Nalepa, Jakub, Training- And Test-Time Data Augmentation for Hyperspectral Image Segmentation, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 17, 2, pp. 292-296, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS)","2024 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS 2024","","Athens","202443","21537003; 21536996","1424412129; 0780312406; 9780780390508; 9798350320107; 9781728163741; 9781424495658; 9781665427920; 9781479911141; 9781479957750; 9781479979295","IGRSE","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208780756"

However, the fixed receptive field feature extraction adopted by current mainstream methods limits the dynamic focusing ability of the model, resulting in insufficient context information capture, which leads to small object submergence. Furthermore, the complex background and dense distribution of objects in remote sensing images also increase the difficulty of detection, making it vulnerable to noise and fuzzy boundary interference. Therefore, we propose a new arbitrary-oriented object detection (AOOD) network called composite perception and multiscale fusion network (CPMFNet). First, to aggregate different levels of context information of the object and effectively enhance the context modeling ability of the detector, we propose an adaptive spatial perception module (ASPM) and insert it into the residual network as a plug-and-play module to realize dynamic receptive field convolution. Second, we redesigned a feature pyramid network (FPN) equipped with a composite perception and context integration module (CPCIM) and detail noise balance filter (DNBF). CPCIM realizes cross-scale feature fusion, mines position and detail features of shallow networks, enhances global semantic expression, and weakens interference of background information. DNBF can effectively suppress the interference of noise and fuzzy boundaries and guide deep networks to alleviate the inundation of small objects. Experiments on four remote sensing benchmark datasets (DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, DIOR-R, and HRSC2016) show that CPMFNet (ours) achieves SOTA performance, in which the mean average precision (mAP) is 78.23% on the DOTA-v1.0 dataset, 70.85% on the DOTA-v1.5 dataset, and 67.58% and 98.61% on the DIOR-R and HRSC2016 datasets, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arbitrary-oriented Object Detection (aood); Feature Fusion; Multiscale Objects; Remote Sensing Image; Image Fusion; Object Detection; Object Recognition; Optical Remote Sensing; Arbitrary-oriented Object Detection; Background Information; Context Information; Features Fusions; Multiscale Fusion; Multiscale Object; Objects Detection; Receptive Fields; Remote Sensing Images; Small Objects; Proximity Sensors; Perception; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Satellite Data; Satellite Imagery","Image fusion; Object detection; Object recognition; Optical remote sensing; Arbitrary-oriented object detection; Background information; Context information; Features fusions; Multiscale fusion; Multiscale object; Objects detection; Receptive fields; Remote sensing images; Small objects; Proximity sensors; perception; precision agriculture; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41971365; in part by the Key Cooperation Project of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission of China under Grant HZ2021008; and in part by the Project of Key Laboratory of Tourism Multisource Data Perception and Decision, Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China, under Grant E020H202300.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41971365, Key Cooperation Project of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission of China under Grant HZ2021008, and Project of Key Laboratory of Tourism Multisource Data Perception and Decision, Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China under Grant E020H202300.

This is achieved by leveraging the capabilities of smart maps, artificial intelligence, and agricultural data analytics. Hence, farmers can benefit from it as it allows them to streamline resource utilization. This, in turn, leads to reduced inputs of fertilizers, labor, seeds, and water, while simultaneously amplifying crops. Therefore, this paper introduces a comprehensive system for advancing smart map agriculture, comprising five pivotal stages designed to yield accurate and meaningful results. Notable progress is achieved through meticulous data acquisition by employing the rice seedling and WeedNet datasets, coupled with feature extraction utilizing the MobileNet architecture. The classification stage is critical for distinguishing between rice and land in the first dataset and between crops and weeds in the second one. It further enhances the system's efficacy. Additionally, segmentation using K-means clustering to detect rice or crop is employed. Notably, the current approach exhibits promising performance levels. It results in 99.7%, 100%, 99.4%, and 99.72% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1_score, respectively, in the rice seedling dataset, as well as achieving 98.72%, 97.3%, 100%, and 98.63% in the WeedNet dataset. The primary contribution of this study lies in the integration of MobileNet and SVM architectures for feature extraction and classification in the agriculture field.

This study presents a novel approach to the classification of four major cotton leaf diseases: Employing an exclusive VGG16 fine-tuned deep learning model to diagnose and evaluate cotton plant diseases such as Cotton Bacterial Blight, Verticillium Wilt, Fusarium Wilt, and Cotton Leaf Curl Disease. We employed a leaf image dataset to span a vast spectrum of signs symptoms conditions to pre-train and fine-tune the model. By performing diligent pre-training involving image augmentation and model adjustment for the particular task of cotton leaf disease detection, we found that VGG16 architecture is flexible enough to apply to our case. The model's performance was subject to a thorough assessment with the help of a different testing dataset proving the accuracy of a total classification of 93.8%. Precision score, recall score, and F1 score metrics also enlighten us that the model can accurately detect and classify the disease. The study reflects the possibility of creating the medium for fine-tuned deep-learning models in agricultural areas that represent an integral and efficient instrument for early disease detection and management. The results illuminated the actual consequences, and pathway for improvement of farm monitoring, minimized economic losses, and suggested support for sustainable farming practices.

Traditional disease detection methods are often inefficient and error-prone. To address this issue, we propose the ECA-ViT model, which combines Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and Vision Transformers (ViT) to identify crop leaf diseases in cultivation environments. The ECA-ViT model uses adaptive 1D convolution kernels for rapid cross-channel interaction of local disease features in crop images, compensating for the Vision Transformer's lack of global context understanding and optimizing the model. This balanced approach enhances feature learning while maintaining computational efficiency without increasing model complexity.

Between-flock variability in the egg production curve is high, especially with layers in non-cage housing systems, due to environmental stressors, diseases and welfare issues. Lengthening the production period emphasizes the need to detect health and welfare issues early to prevent long-term effects on egg production and thereby retain profitable revenues. Current solutions for anomaly detection rely on comparing egg production data to inflexible, generic reference curves or on machine learning models with low confidence anomaly detection due to absence of expert feedback and model adaptability. The objective of this study is to develop an expert-in-the-loop algorithm for early problem detection and flock-specific prediction of egg production in layers. To identify anomalies in the egg production curve, the model compares daily acquired production data against an expert-defined adaptive reference trajectory. The model employs a one-class support vector machines that is continuously enhanced using feedback from the expert in case of low confidence anomalies. The proposed algorithm is trained using synthetic datasets and tested on real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed algorithm has high anomaly detection accuracy (96%) with an F1 score of 0.93. Ultimately, the proposed algorithm will facilitate predictive maintenance of egg production, thereby allowing for personalized support in decision-making. In the future, the algorithm could be adapted to detect anomalies in other age-dependent production parameters. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Anomaly Detection; Dynamic Time Warping; Egg Production Curve; Expert-in-the-loop; Flock-specific Modelling; Incremental One-class Smv; Fertilizers; Precision Agriculture; Support Vector Machines; Adaptive Anomaly Detection; Anomaly Detection; Dynamic Time Warping; Egg Production; Egg Production Curve; Expert-in-the-loop; Flock-specific Modeling; Incremental One-class Smv; Loop Algorithms; Production Curve; Predictive Maintenance","Fertilizers; Precision agriculture; Support vector machines; Adaptive anomaly detection; Anomaly detection; Dynamic time warping; Egg production; Egg production curve; Expert-in-the-loop; Flock-specific modeling; Incremental one-class SMV; Loop algorithms; Production curve; Predictive maintenance","","","","Aach, John Dennis, Aligning gene expression time series with time warping algorithms, Bioinformatics, 17, 6, pp. 495-508, (2001); Berckmans, Daniel, General introduction to precision livestock farming, Animal Frontiers, 7, 1, pp. 6-11, (2017); Neural Computation, (1995); Bumanis, Nikolajs, Hen Egg Production Forecasting: Capabilities of Machine Learning Models in Scenarios with Limited Data Sets, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 13, 13, (2023); Carletto, Calogero, Better data, higher impact: Improving agricultural data systems for societal change, European Review of Agricultural Economics, 48, 4, pp. 719-740, (2021); undefined, (2023); Grossman, Michael, A model for persistency of egg production, Poultry Science, 79, 12, pp. 1715-1724, (2000); Iwana, Brian Kenji, An empirical survey of data augmentation for time series classification with neural networks, PLOS ONE, 16, 7 July, (2021); Keogh, Eamonn J., Exact indexing of dynamic time warping, Knowledge and Information Systems, 7, 3, pp. 358-386, (2005); Kloska, Matej, Expert enhanced dynamic time warping based anomaly detection, Expert Systems with Applications, 225, (2023)","Berckmans, D.; Tassinari, P.; Torreggiani, D.","European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming","Boehringer Ingelheim; et al.; Granarolo; Granlatte; MSD Animal Health; Parmigiano Reggiano","11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming","","Bologna","202416","","9791221067361","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204952917"

By utilizing multispectral remote sensing data, our model leverages the spatial hierarchy of 3D-CNNs, the temporal sequencing capabilities of ConvLSTM, and the global context analysis of ViTs to capture complex patterns in agricultural datasets. The integration of these advanced methodologies allows for a comprehensive analysis of both spatial and temporal aspects of crop growth, enabling more accurate and robust predictions. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods, as evidenced by lower root mean square error and higher correlation coefficients. The 3D-CNN component effectively extracts spatial features from the multispectral images, while the ConvLSTM captures the temporal dynamics of crop development. The ViT further refines these features by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input data through self-attention mechanisms.

This research presents a novel Internet of Things (IoT)-driven crop management system, NeuroRF FarmSense, specifically designed for precision agriculture. By utilizing soil sensors and a robust IoT framework, this system enables effective data collection across vast and remote agricultural areas. The study utilizes an extensive Crop Recommendation Dataset obtained from Kaggle, which includes 2,200 entries and seven critical attributes essential for crop selection: phosphorus, humidity, potassium, temperature, nitrogen, pH, and rainfall. This dataset provides a detailed methodology for crop recommendations, revealing more than 22 alternative crops based on varying characteristics. For agricultural forecasting, the NeuroRF FarmSense system employs the NeuroRF Classifier, which integrates neural networks (NN) with the Random Forest Classifier, achieving an unprecedented accuracy of 99.82%, exceeding prior records. This integrative approach harnesses the advantages of NN's ReLU activation and dropout regularization alongside the robustness of RF. By utilizing NN predictions as input features for RF training and refining RF through grid search with cross-validation, the ensemble model produces highly precise predictions, facilitating strategic crop cultivation for optimal yields across diverse environmental conditions. This innovative methodology signifies a strong solution for classification challenges in precision agriculture. By merging IoT technology with machine learning algorithms, smart farming is poised to enter a transformative phase, providing a scalable response to the pressing issues of global food security.

Potato late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans is a serious threat to potato crops requiring fast and accurate detection methods to minimize losses. A new approach using deep learning was suggested in this study to spot this disease at an early stage. The study focused on developing and training a YOLOv8n model with a dataset of 14,150 images and annotations from Berkane, Morocco. This dataset was carefully chosen to cover a diverse range of symptoms and stages of potato blight under different environmental conditions to ensure the model’s reliability, robustness, and generalizability. The model is known for its suitable design for real-time decisions in agricultural settings due to its lightweight size. However, this experiment shows that YOLOv8n has a modest detection performance on complex and diverse datasets, making it an interesting opportunity for enhancing research towards early intervention against potato late blight using lightweight models - the potential of deep learning to improve farming methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer Vision; Crop Disease Detection; Deep Learning; Precision Agriculture; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Agricultural Practices; Crop Disease; Crop Disease Detection; Deep Learning; Detection Models; Disease Detection; Learning Approach; Potato Late Blights; Precision Agriculture; Single Stage; Plant Diseases","Deep reinforcement learning; Agricultural practices; Crop disease; Crop disease detection; Deep learning; Detection models; Disease detection; Learning approach; Potato late blights; Precision Agriculture; Single stage; Plant diseases","","","","Seif-Ennasr, Marieme, Gis-based land suitability and crop vulnerability assessment under climate change in chtouka ait baha, morocco, Atmosphere, 11, 11, (2020); Atlas Journal of Biology, (2017); Egyptian Journal of Agricultural Economics, (2022); Padhan, Bandana, Potential of Neglected and Underutilized Yams (Dioscorea spp.) for Improving Nutritional Security and Health Benefits, Frontiers in Pharmacology, 11, (2020); Subramanya, S.

Traditional wheat detection methods usually rely on hand-designed feature extractors and classifiers, but the ability and generalization of feature representations limit their performance. In contrast, deep learning-based methods can automatically learn feature representations and perform end-to-end training on large-scale datasets, with more vital representation ability and generalization. In this study, we propose a PVT-based detection method for wheat. PVT is a visual model combining a Transformer and feature pyramid, simultaneously capturing global and local information in images. The experimental results show that the PVT model is adaptable and can be generalized in wheat detection. It can provide accurate detection results of wheat ears and maintain stability when dealing with different light conditions and wheat growth cycles. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Computer Vision; Pvt; Wheat Detection; Detection Methods; Feature Classifiers; Feature Extractor; Feature Representation; Generalisation; Learning-based Methods; Performance; Plantings; Precision Agriculture; Wheat Detection; Livestock","Detection methods; Feature classifiers; Feature extractor; Feature representation; Generalisation; Learning-based methods; Performance; Plantings; Precision Agriculture; Wheat detection; Livestock","","","","Yolov4 Optimal Speed and Accuracy of Object Detection, (2020); Sparse R Cnn End to End Object Detection with Learnable Proposals, (2020); Lin, Tsungyi, Feature pyramid networks for object detection, 2017-January, pp. 936-944, (2017); Wang, Wenhai, Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Versatile Backbone for Dense Prediction without Convolutions, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 548-558, (2021); Feature Pyramid Grids, (2020); Vaswani, Ashish, Attention is all you need, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017-December, pp. 5999-6009, (2017); Liu, Ze, Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 9992-10002, (2021); Zhou, Qiong, A wheat spike detection method based on Transformer, Frontiers in Plant Science, 13, (2022); Girshick, Ross B., Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 580-587, (2014); Fast R Cnn, (2015)","Du, K.; Zain, A.B.M.","SPIE","Academic Exchange Information Centre (AEIC)","4th International Conference on Image Processing and Intelligent Control, IPIC 2024","","Kuala Lumpur","202151","0277786X; 1996756X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510688728; 9781510688629; 9781510692671; 9781510693326","PSISD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203106758"

Limited by accuracy and processing speed, traditional detection methods hinder effective disease management. We introduce USST, a novel cassava leaf disease detection approach to address this challenge. USST employs a synergistic combination of two attention mechanisms for enhanced feature learning: optimized self-guided attention (SGA) captures global disease patterns. In contrast, a simple and efficient attention mechanism (simAM) precisely identifies disease-related regions in cassava leaf images. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that USST's comprehensive integration of global and local perspectives is highly effective for cassava leaf disease identification, especially in real plant environments. This approach surpasses previous methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On the Cassava Leaf Diseases Dataset, USST achieved an industry-leading accuracy of 88.48%, significantly outperforming established methodologies. This automated disease identification method presents an effective solution for farmers, with the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cassava Protection; Deep Learning; Precision Agriculture; Sga; Simam; Deep Learning; Food Supply; Plants (botany); Precision Agriculture; Attention Mechanisms; Cassavum Protection; Crop Quality; Crop Yield; Disease Classification; Leaf Disease; Precision Agriculture; Self-guided Attention; Simam; Cultivation","Deep learning; Food supply; Plants (botany); Precision agriculture; Attention mechanisms; Cassavum protection; Crop quality; Crop yield; Disease classification; Leaf disease; Precision Agriculture; Self-guided attention; SimAM; Cultivation","","","This work is supported by the Department of Education of Guangdong Province 2022 \u201CSpecial Project in Key Areas\u201D (No. 2022ZDZX1055) and the Department of Education of Guangdong Province 2021 \u201CFeatured Innovation Project\u201D (No. 2021KTSCX218).","Amelework, Assefa Beyene, Adoption and Promotion of Resilient Crops for Climate Risk Mitigation and Import Substitution: A Case Analysis of Cassava for South African Agriculture, Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, 5, (2021); Plant Pathology, (2023); Latif, Sajid, Potential of cassava leaves in human nutrition: A review, Trends in Food Science and Technology, 44, 2, pp. 147-158, (2015); Chikoti, Patrick Chiza, Cassava mosaic disease: a review of a threat to cassava production in Zambia, Journal of Plant Pathology, 101, 3, pp. 467-477, (2019); Boulent, Justine, Convolutional Neural Networks for the Automatic Identification of Plant Diseases, Frontiers in Plant Science, 10, (2019); Patil, Basavaprabhu L., Cassava brown streak disease: A threat to food security in Africa, Journal of General Virology, 96, 5, pp. 956-968, (2015); Maryum, Alina, Cassava Leaf Disease Classification using Deep Neural Networks, pp. 32-37, (2021); Sambasivam, G., A predictive machine learning application in agriculture: Cassava disease detection and classification with imbalanced dataset using convolutional neural networks, Egyptian Informatics Journal, 22, 1, pp. 27-34, (2021); Paiva-Peredo, Ernesto Alonso, Deep Learning for the Classification of Cassava Leaf Diseases in Unbalanced Field Data Set, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1798 CCIS, pp. 101-114, (2023); J Supercomputing, (2023)","Huang, D.-S.; Si, Z.; Chen, W.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","20th International Conference on Intelligent Computing, ICIC 2024","","Tianjin","316369","16113349; 03029743","9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201188410"

The study proposes a robust classification model using CNN and SVM. The table displays the model's high F1-Score, accuracy, and recall across several illness classes. Recall and accuracy scores between 92.86% and 95.17% indicate how effectively the model finds acceptable instances and makes excellent predictions. F1-score, which ranges from 92.99% to 94.85%, indicates the model can distinguish circumstances. It works for 655 to 725 instances of each illness class, according to support figures. Our classifier can discover numerous potato illnesses with 98% accuracy. The wide, weighted, and micro means, which range from 94.24% to 94.26% across categories, further aid the model. The model's sickness detection accuracy and agricultural potential are shown using modern machine learning approaches. This precise model can distinguish healthy leaves from rust, Powdery Scab, Leaf Roll Virus, Late Blight, and Early Dying Syndrome. The model is reliable and constant among parameters, making it useful for potato disease detection. This breakthrough improves precision agriculture by helping farmers identify ill potato crops early. It reduces production costs and promotes environmentally friendly farming. For each illness class, 655-725 instances demonstrate the model's cross-dataset performance. With 98% accuracy, the classification model can identify potato illnesses. Global, weighted, and micro means, which vary from 94.24% to 94.26% depending on the measure, improve the model. Combining contemporary machine learning algorithms illustrates how precise the model can be for identifying diseases and farming. Model performance distinguishes rust, late blight, early blight, leaf roll virus, powdery scab, and early dying syndrome. The model consistently satisfies several variables, making it an excellent potato disease detection tool. This discovery helps us detect potato crop illnesses early and accurately, advancing precision agriculture. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Innovative; Research; Sustainable; Technology; Agricultural Technology; Diseases; Farms; Learning Algorithms; Precision Agriculture; Support Vector Machines; Viruses; Classification Models; Cnn Models; Disease Classification; Disease Detection; F1 Scores; Innovative; Late Blight; Precision Agriculture; Sustainable; Technology; Crops","Agricultural technology; Diseases; Farms; Learning algorithms; Precision agriculture; Support vector machines; Viruses; Classification models; CNN models; Disease classification; Disease detection; F1 scores; Innovative; Late blight; Precision Agriculture; Sustainable; Technology; Crops","","","","Tiwari, Divyansh, Potato Leaf Diseases Detection Using Deep Learning, pp. 461-466, (2020); Rozaqi, Abdul Jalil, Identification of Disease in Potato Leaves Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Algorithm, pp. 72-76, (2020); Islam, Monzurul, Detection of potato diseases using image segmentation and multiclass support vector machine, Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, (2017); Lee, Trong Yen, High Efficiency Disease Detection for Potato Leaf with Convolutional Neural Network, SN Computer Science, 2, 4, (2021); Asif, Md Khalid Rayhan, CNN based disease detection approach on potato leaves, pp. 428-432, (2020); Singh, Aditi, Potato plant leaves disease detection and classification using machine learning methodologies, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 1022, 1, (2021); Liu, Fuquan, Disease Spots Identification of Potato Leaves in Hyperspectral Based on Locally Adaptive 1D-CNN, pp. 355-358, (2020); Kibriya, Hareem, Plant Disease Identification and Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network and SVM., pp. 264-268, (2021); Bangari, Sindhuja, A Survey on Disease Detection of a potato Leaf Using CNN, pp. 144-149, (2022); Sholihati, Rizqi Amaliatus, Potato Leaf Disease Classification Using Deep Learning Approach, pp. 392-397, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE","5th IEEE International Conference for Emerging Technology, INCET 2024","","Belgaum; Jain College of Engineering","201275","","9798350361155","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201017455"

However, very small studies shed light on the capabilities of grape disease detection. Grape is an important fruit worldwide, and early diagnosis and detection of grape diseases are crucial for ensuring plant health and preventing yield and quality reductions in the grape-growing industry. To fill the gap, this study developed a vision transformer model for the diagnosis of grape leaf disease. To provide a comprehensive understanding of ViT, in this study, the experiments were conducted with different image sizes and patch sizes of grape leaf images. Moreover, to extend the capabilities, both augmented and non-augmented datasets were used in the experiment configurations on two types of datasets, and the proposed model can provide quite similar output for both data (augmented and without augmented) in classifying grape disease, with approximately 98–99% validation and testing accuracy. This achievement highlights the potential of integrating advanced deep learning tools into the nation’s agricultural practices. As worldwide fruit demands are increasing, this study provides a foundation for how machine learning techniques can be implemented to increase fruit production by identifying diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","F1 Score; Loss Function; Precision; Training Time; Vision Transformers; Classification (of Information); Deep Learning; Fruits; Learning Systems; Down-stream; F1 Scores; Grape Leaves; Leaf Disease; Loss Functions; Precision; Precision Agriculture; Training Time; Transformer Modeling; Vision Transformer; Diagnosis","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Fruits; Learning systems; Down-stream; F1 scores; Grape leaves; Leaf disease; Loss functions; Precision; Precision Agriculture; Training time; Transformer modeling; Vision transformer; Diagnosis","","","","Zhou, Zenan, Diagnosis of retinal diseases using the vision transformer model based on optical coherence tomography images, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 12601, (2023); Dutta, Pramit, Conv-ViT: A Convolution and Vision Transformer-Based Hybrid Feature Extraction Method for Retinal Disease Detection, Journal of Imaging, 9, 7, (2023); An Image is Worth 16x16 Words Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale, (2020); Lu, Xiangyu, A hybrid model of ghost-convolution enlightened transformer for effective diagnosis of grape leaf disease and pest, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 34, 5, pp. 1755-1767, (2022); Explainable Vision Transformer Enabled Convolutional Neural Network for Plant Disease Identification Plantxvit, (2022); Advancements in Deep Learning for Accurate Classification of Grape Leaves and Diagnosis of Grape Diseases, (2023); Thai, Huy Tan, Artificial Cognition for Early Leaf Disease Detection using Vision Transformers, International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications, 2021-October, pp. 33-38, (2021); Li, Cheng, Identification Method of Grape Leaf Diseases Based on Improved CCT Model, International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, 36, 11, (2022); Jaisakthi, S.

It sparks debates about its usage, but despite the contradictions that arise, there are many benefits to applying it in various areas. In this paper, the authors investigate the possibilities of implementing machine learning algorithms to help optimize crop management for precision agriculture. Meeting current food demands becomes an increasingly challenging task as the population grows. Applying machine learning using IoT data analytics in the agricultural sector will bring forth additional advantages, increasing not only the quantity but also the quality of production from crop fields to meet the rising food demands. The main objective of the paper is to employ various machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling and subsequently develop a robust model capable of making accurate predictions on unseen agricultural data. The research methodology involves preprocessing the acquired dataset, including data cleaning and feature engineering to enhance model performance. The authors systematically apply a range of machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic regression, Decision trees, Naïve Bayes, and k-nearest Neighbor, to identify the most effective approach for crop yield prediction. For better model performance, boosting techniques of machine learning are also implemented.

Precision agriculture, driven by on-site data collected from various sensors, plays a pivotal role in optimizing irrigation, fertilization, and enhancing plant health and crop yield. However, the manual process of in-filed chlorophyll measurement, which is a key metric for guiding agricultural decisions, is very cumbersome and poses significant challenges. This paper explores the transformative potential of multispectral imaging data to automate plant measuring and monitoring tasks, thereby reducing labor and time costs while improving the quality of data available for making informed agricultural decisions. We present a deep-learning model for instance segmentation of plants, trained on the Growliflower dataset of RGB and multispectral image cubes of cauliflower plants. The proposed algorithm uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to leverage both the spectral information and and its spatial context to locate individual plants. We introduce a novel band-selection algorithm for determining the most significant multispectral features for use in the convolutional network: this reduces model complexity while ensuring accurate results. Our model’s ability to generalize across varying growth stages, soil conditions, and varieties of crops in the training dataset demonstrates its suitability for real-world agricultural applications.

These platforms captured high-resolution multi-spectral (MS) image data during extensive field trials, enabling concurrent evaluation of thousands of plots with diverse seed varieties and management practices. However, breeders still relied on manual and intricate data extraction, processing, and analysis of high-resolution imagery for drawing results. A significant challenge was identifying plot locations within MS imagery, delineating plot boundaries, and providing spatial references to each plot. Therefore, the study was conducted to develop an automated methodology for creating multiple polygon shape files with unique identifiers for overlaying drone imagery data with centimeter-level accuracy for obtaining zonal statistics of each phenotype plot. The goal was to develop a pipeline without assuming field uniformity, plot spacing, size, or quantity, minimizing the need for manual adjustments. The proposed method used a high-accuracy planter-logged Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) and georeferenced MS-UAV imagery. This process automatically generated plot boundaries by converting RTK-GPS points to polygons representing each planted plot. The resulting pipeline automatically produced maps of Vegetative Indices (VI), multi-polygon shape files, and CSV files of plot boundaries for external software and downstream analysis. Notably, the polygon shape file consistently aligned with plot boundaries within the image and even across temporal data sets with the least manual adjustments. This approach provided an efficient, adaptable, and replicable automated solution, minimizing time, labor, and user involvement while facilitating zonal statistics extraction of each phenotype plot from MS imagery. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Delineating Plot Boundaries; High-throughput Phenotyping; Multispectral Uav Imagery; Rtk-gps Coordinates; Antennas; Automation; Data Handling; Extraction; Geometry; Global Positioning System; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Aerial Vehicle; Delineating Plot Boundary; High-throughput Phenotyping; Multi-spectral; Multispectral Imagery; Multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Imagery; Precision Agriculture; Real-time Kinematic Global Positioning System Coordinate; Real-time Kinematic Global Positioning Systems; Zonal Statistics; Pipelines","Antennas; Automation; Data handling; Extraction; Geometry; Global positioning system; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Delineating plot boundary; High-throughput phenotyping; Multi-spectral; Multispectral imagery; Multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle imagery; Precision Agriculture; Real-time kinematic global positioning system coordinate; Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning Systems; Zonal statistics; Pipelines","","","The authors thank Carl and Melinda Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering and Department of Agronomy of Kansas State University for their support.

Early detection also minimises the usage of chemical substances and pesticides and hinders the spread of the disease to healthy crops. On a broader scale, it aids in halting the global spread of diseases. Thus, it ultimately promotes healthier rice crops and increased yield. In this survey paper, we present a thorough exploration of deep learning (DL) models for the classification of paddy diseases. Our paper delves into the motivation behind this research study, reveals different paddy diseases and their associated symptoms, and unravels various deep-learning models employed for disease detection.

In a learning process characterized by interconnectedness, collaboration, and data protection and confidentiality maintenance, the five participants (xc_1 to xc_5) have applied different data representations to the model. The summary explains our approach to analytical matters, citing the influence of global and local data analyzed via the trained AI model using federated averaging. The most considerable average accuracy was observed for all clients at xc_5, 95.71%, whereas the first version was much lower at xc_1, only 88.76%. It demonstrated clear progress from the eventual to the initial stages of the model learning without bias towards certain classes. Weighted averages are essential to the analysis of the datasets where there are imbalances. With xc_1, the weighted average starts at 89.15 and reaches the top with xc_5 of 95.72. The fact that it is more accurate and adaptable when categorizing common diseases is demonstrated by the improved precision that is illustrated in general. The micro average is the resultant average that depicts the general model accuracy, while the weight averages are the averages based on the weight. To be specific, the accuracy for sample 1 reached 89.13%, and sample 5 overviewed the accuracy level and reached 95.72%. The core of the work is federated averaging, which transforms the world's local neighborhood analytics into a universal understanding of the world.

The study presents a new categorization scheme for leaf diseases that uses four severity levels based on the distribution of a dataset through 4 different clients. It aimed to exploit the decentralized nature of FL to improve data privacy while benefiting from powerful image classification potentials offered by CNNs. Two of the four clients in our study, fq1 to fq4, provided local data combined via Federated Averaging into a global model. The result analysis applied three key metrics: macro, micro, and weighted averages that portray the model's local and international performance. The results from every client indicated a steady increase in classification accuracy. The Macro Average at approximately even treatment of all the classes increased steadily from fq-1 (96.35%) until fq-4 (99.11%). Similarly, the Weighted Average that considers class representation began at 96.45% for f q-1 and ended at 99.10 % table for fq-4. The same pattern was obtained with the Micro Average in which contributions from all classes are summed up to have this average increased markedly, that is, 96.44% for fq-1 and sharply rises to a total of 99.10%% it reached its peak at time f: When computing based on percentages correctly assigned, the assumption made right before Class These averages show the overall balanced performance of the model for different severity classes regardless whether they appear more often in a dataset or not. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cauliflower Leaves; Cnn; Disease Bifurcations; Distributed Learning; Severity Analysis; Convolutional Neural Networks; Data Privacy; Statistical Methods; Cauliflower Leaves; Convolutional Neural Network; Disease Bifurcation; Distributed Learning; Leaf Disease; New Approaches; Performance; Precision Agriculture; Severity Analysis; Weighted Averages; Image Enhancement","Convolutional neural networks; Data privacy; Statistical methods; Cauliflower leaves; Convolutional neural network; Disease bifurcation; Distributed learning; Leaf disease; New approaches; Performance; Precision Agriculture; Severity analysis; Weighted averages; Image enhancement","","","","Jiang, Feng, Image recognition of four rice leaf diseases based on deep learning and support vector machine, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 179, (2020); Mehta, Shiva, Heritage Coin Identification using Convolutional Neural Networks: A Multi-Classification Approach for Numismatic Research, pp. 1-6, (2023); Mehta, Shiva, Empowering Farmers with AI: Federated Learning of CNNs for Wheat Diseases Multi-Classification, (2023); Mehta, Shiva, Agriculture Breakthrough: Federated ConvNets for Unprecedented Maize Disease Detection and Severity Estimation, pp. 375-380, (2023); Service Industries Journal, (2022); Mehta, Shiva, Improving Crop Health Management: Federated Learning CNN for Spinach Leaf Disease Detection, (2023); Dandotiya, Ravi, An examination of tourists’ national identity, place attachment and loyalty at a dark tourist destination, Kybernetes, 52, 12, pp. 6063-6077, (2023); Mehta, Shiva, Next-Generation Wheat Disease Monitoring: Leveraging Federated Convolutional Neural Networks for Severity Estimation, (2023); Kumar, Deepak, Deep learning in wheat diseases classification: A systematic review, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 81, 7, pp. 10143-10187, (2022); Kukreja, Vinay, Deep learning in Human Gait Recognition: An Overview, pp. 9-13, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference for Innovation in Technology, INOCON 2024","","Bangalore; Sai Vidya Institute of Technology","199351","","9798350381931","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193610655"

Mobile operators cannot afford comprehensive coverage assessments conducted through drive testing to provide coverage maps, hindering a wider adoption of IoT solutions for precision agriculture. However, system integrators and farmers could conduct on-demand field coverage assessments to evaluate the feasibility of embracing cellular as a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) communication technology in their production units if an affordable tool were accessible. This work proposes an open-source tool for cellular IoT coverage analysis. The system comprises a low-cost, portable, and autonomous device with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) chip and a cellular modem. Constructed using affordable, interconnectable kits (Arduino Zero and a Quectel BG96 modem board) powered by a power bank, it offers several hours of energy autonomy. The device collects network information and transmits it in georeferenced form via MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) to a server for storage and user-friendly visualization. The server side is composed of four open-source systems. Eclipse Mosquitto serves as the system's core, implementing the MQTT protocol. Telegraf, a server-based agent, subscribes to Mosquitto topics, extracts data from JSON-formatted messages, and sends it to InfluxDB, a time-series database, for storage. Finally, Grafana serves as a powerful web-based data visualization system, retrieving and displaying InfluxDB data through a color-coded map. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional potential and effectiveness of the proposed solution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Internet Of Things; Open-source Tool; Precision Agriculture; Data Visualization; Global Positioning System; Internet Of Things; Low Power Electronics; Modems; Open Systems; Precision Agriculture; Visualization; Wide Area Networks; Cellulars; Coverage Map; Data Collection System; Geographical Variations; Mobile Operators; Open Source Tools; Open-source; Precision Agriculture; Remote Rural Areas; System Integrators; Digital Storage","Data visualization; Global positioning system; Internet of things; Low power electronics; Modems; Open systems; Precision agriculture; Visualization; Wide area networks; Cellulars; Coverage map; Data collection system; Geographical variations; Mobile operators; Open source tools; Open-source; Precision Agriculture; Remote rural areas; System integrators; Digital storage","","","","Avşar, Ercan, Wireless communication protocols in smart agriculture: A review on applications, challenges and future trends, Ad Hoc Networks, 136, (2022); Krasniqi, Fidel, Performance analysis of mobile 4G/LTE networks, (2018); John Dian, F.

This research introduces an innovative approach for automating the detection of cassava leaf diseases. We propose the use of an Enhanced Canny Edge Detector (ECED) in conjunction with Stacked Autoencoders (SAE) and Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Networks (DS-CNN) as a novel technique. The ECED is designed to enhance edge detection accuracy by addressing certain limitations of the traditional Canny edge detector. It incorporates adaptive thresholding, and noise reduction methods to generate more accurate and robust edge maps. The methodology consists of three essential components: DS-CNN for efficient feature extraction and classification, SAE for improved feature representation learning, and ECED for precise edge feature extraction. This combination harnesses both texture and structural information to enhance disease detection accuracy.

It poses a threat to both the quantity and quality of the rice they obtain. Our work proposes a novel approach utilizing a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning (DL) model to accurately assess the severity of a rice panicle blast. This facilitates the resolution of the issue. This novel approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches to illness diagnosis. These methods are frequently incorrect and inefficient due to their requirement for extensive effort. For this research, we developed and meticulously trained a hybrid model utilizing a robust dataset of over 15,000 distinctly labeled images. These photographs depicted several stages and issues related to blast illness in rice panicles. Our model is unique due to its utilization of the salient features of CNN for spatial localization in images, and LSTM networks for efficient temporal information processing. This union creates a powerful tool for accurately categorizing illnesses. The CNN-LSTM model achieved a high accuracy rate of 97.97% in correctly predicting the severity of a disease within the range of one to five levels. The model maintained a consistently high level of accuracy, recall, and F1-score across all groups. This demonstrates the robustness and reliability of it. Our model surpasses traditional methods. It remains consistent and precise, demonstrating significant advancements in the field of agricultural disease categorization. This study not only provides an effective method for testing rice panicle blast, but also opens up new opportunities for the utilization of intelligent machinery in agriculture. This approach demonstrates the efficacy of DL techniques in enhancing disease management, resulting in increased agricultural yield and environmentally sustainable farming practices. Subsequent research endeavors may endeavor to employ this approach on a broader range of plant species and diseases.

Wheat, a staple crop worldwide, requires accurate and prompt prediction of its output for global food security. Traditionally, the development of empirical models for crop yield forecasting has relied on climate data, satellite data, or a combination of both. Despite the enhanced performance achieved by integrating satellite and climate data, the contributions from various sources (Climate, Soil, Socioeconomic, and Remote sensing) remain unclear. The lack of well-defined comparisons between the performance of regression-based approaches and different Machine Learning (ML) methods in yield prediction necessitates further investigation. This study addresses the gaps by combining data from multiple sources to forecast wheat yield in the Multan region in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The findings are compared to the benchmark provided by Crop Report Services (CRS) Punjab, with three widely used ML techniques (support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)) by integrating publicly available data within the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform, including climate, satellite, soil properties, and spatial information data to develop alternative empirical models for yield prediction using data from 2017 to 2022, selecting the best attribute subset related to crop output. The district-level simulated yield data set was analyzed with three ML models (SVM, RF, and LASSO) as a function of seasonal weather, satellite, and soil. The results indicate that combining all datasets using three ML algorithms achieves better yield prediction performance (R2: 0.74-0.88). Incorporating spatial information and other properties into benchmark models can improve the prediction from 0.08 to 0.12. Random forest outperformed the competitor models with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.05 q/ha and R2 of 0.88. Comparative analysis shows that random forest with 97% and SVM with 93% yielded better results in the study area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cnn; Crop Yield Prediction; Lasso; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing; Rf; Svm; Climate Change; Climate Models; Crops; Data Fusion; Data Integration; Earth (planet); Food Supply; Forestry; Learning Algorithms; Mean Square Error; Population Statistics; Rain; Regression Analysis; Remote Sensing; Satellites; Soils; Weather Forecasting; Benchmark Testing; Crop Yield; Crop Yield Prediction; Least Absolute Shrinkage And Selection Operators; Machine-learning; Precision Agriculture; Predictive Models; Random Forests; Remote-sensing; Satellite Images; Spatial Database; Support Vectors Machine; Yield Prediction; Support Vector Machines","Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Data fusion; Data integration; Earth (planet); Food supply; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Population statistics; Rain; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soils; Weather forecasting; Benchmark testing; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Machine-learning; Precision Agriculture; Predictive models; Random forests; Remote-sensing; Satellite images; Spatial database; Support vectors machine; Yield prediction; Support vector machines","","","","Marszalek, Michael, Prediction of multi-year winter wheat yields at the field level with satellite and climatological data, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 194, (2022); Jhajharia, Kavita, Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques, Procedia Computer Science, 218, pp. 406-417, (2022); Johnson, Michael D., Crop yield forecasting on the Canadian Prairies by remotely sensed vegetation indices and machine learning methods, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 218-219, pp. 74-84, (2016); Tanabe, Ryoya, Winter wheat yield prediction using convolutional neural networks and UAV-based multispectral imagery, Field Crops Research, 291, (2023); Dempewolf, Jan, Wheat production forecasting for Pakistan from satellite data, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), pp. 3239-3242, (2013); Sadad, Tariq, Detection of Cardiovascular Disease Based on PPG Signals Using Machine Learning with Cloud Computing, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2022, (2022); Badshah, Afzal, Towards Smart Education through Internet of Things: A Survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 56, 2, (2024); Di, Yan, A New Framework for Winter Wheat Yield Prediction Integrating Deep Learning and Bayesian Optimization, Agronomy, 12, 12, (2022); Ahmed, Moiz Uddin, Prediction of Wheat Production Using Machine Learning Algorithms in northern areas of Pakistan, Telecommunications Policy, 46, 6, (2022); Land Use Atlas of Pakistan, (1974)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188440011"

A system for accurately identifying crops and weeds in images is crucial component of automated weeding equipment. However, in the field environment, crops and weeds grow intertwined, and weeds are very similar to sugarcane leaves, making it difficult to accurately segment crops, weeds, and their boundaries from images. In this paper, we proposed a novel network that fully utilizes low-level semantic information to accurately segment crops and weeds in images, improving the accuracy of crop and weed segmentation while reducing the need for training weight parameters and improving speed in the prediction stage. Specifically, we made three important modifications for crop and weed identification. First, a Multi-scale Feature Extraction and Fusion module (MFEF) was designed to capture abundant low-level semantic feature information. Afterward, we introduce a Global Response Normalization (GRN) block to select more useful feature information. Finally, a series of residual attention transformer layers are designed to transmit the long-range dependency information extracted between layers. Numerous experimental results confirmed that our proposed network achieved excellent performance in segmenting sugarcane and weed images. Specifically, (1) the mean accuracy and, Mean Intersection of Union (MIoU) reached 96.97% and 94.13%, respectively, (2) the training parameters of the model have been reduced by more than 25%, improving the Frames Per Second (FPS) value of the prediction process, and (3) is also effective on the publicly available BoniRob Dataset, indicating that the proposed model has considerable generalization ability. This study provides an accurate weed identification map and has reference significance for subsequent systems as mechanical weeding equipment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Precision Agriculture; Segformer; Semantic Segmentation; Transformer; Weeds Identification; Convolution; Crops; Extraction; Image Enhancement; Precision Agriculture; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Computational Modelling; Feature Information; Features Extraction; Images Segmentations; Precision Agriculture; Segformer; Semantic Segmentation; Transformer; Weed Identification; Feature Extraction","Convolution; Crops; Extraction; Image enhancement; Precision agriculture; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Computational modelling; Feature information; Features extraction; Images segmentations; Precision Agriculture; Segformer; Semantic segmentation; Transformer; Weed identification; Feature extraction","","","","Cisternas, Isabel, Systematic literature review of implementations of precision agriculture, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 176, (2020); Herrera, Pedro Javier, A novel approach for weed type classification based on shape descriptors and a fuzzy decision-making method, Sensors, 14, 8, pp. 15304-15324, (2014); Ou, Yinggang, Mechanization technology: The key to sugarcane production in China, International Journal of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, 6, 1, (2013); Arroyo, Javier, An instance-based learning approach for thresholding in crop images under different outdoor conditions, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 127, pp. 669-679, (2016); Zahra, Unber, An Integrated Framework of Two-Stream Deep Learning Models Optimal Information Fusion for Fruits Disease Recognition, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 17, pp. 3038-3052, (2024); Li, Dongming, Research on segmentation methods of weed and soil background under HSI color model, pp. 628-631, (2009); Lavania, Shubham, Novel method for weed classification in maize field using OTSU and PCA implementation, pp. 534-537, (2015); Lin, Fengfang, Detection of corn and weed species by the combination of spectral, shape and textural features, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 8, (2017); Li, Yong, Key technologies of machine vision for weeding robots: A review and benchmark, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 196, (2022); Wu, Yanjuan, Field Crop Extraction Based on Machine Vision, pp. 531-536, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186107014"

The early and accurate detection and classification of these diseases are fundamental for fostering healthy crop production. In recent years, smart agricultural systems have garnered significant attention due to their capability to enhance efficiency by deploying sensor networks and Internet of Things (IoT) devices that collect and analyze environmental data. However, traditional plant disease detection methods are manual, time-consuming, and often need help handling the data's complexity and dynamism. These manual methods do not use heterogeneous data to make better decisions. Corn holds significant importance yet it faces numerous diseases that include main three diseases such as blight, common rust, and grey leaf spot. The advancement of computer technology has led to a pivotal focus on corn leaf diseases classification application based on deep learning. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revealed remarkable achievements within Precision Agriculture (PA) due to their ability to enhance information. To this end, this work introduces a CNN-based architecture, the Multi-Model Fusion Network (MMF-Net). Its primary objective is to classify diseases within the realm of PA. MMF-Net integrates multi-contextual features using RL-block and PL-blocks 1 & 2, thus effectively combining different model streams trained on heterogeneous data. The RL-block uses spatial range to process coarse grained images to convolve the local context, while PL-block 1 extracts fine-grained global context by expanding the perceptual area of images. PL-block 2 deals with real-life environmental parameters as features. The extracted features are syndicated using multiple classifiers that ensemble three individual blocks at the decision level to improve the accuracy. After fusion, it uses adaptively the majority voting scheme to generate the final decision probability score of the base model. Multiple experiments are conducted involving the corn leaf diseases dataset and a real-life numerical dataset, generating an impressive 99.23% accuracy in the classification of corn leaf diseases. Overall, MMF-Net provides a promising and smart solution to identify plant leaf diseases in PA effectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alexnet; Cnn; Corn Disease; Decision Level Fusion; Heterogeneous Data; Multi-context; Multi-model; Pest Control; Precision Agriculture; Resnext; Sensors; Vgg-16; Classification (of Information); Cultivation; Data Handling; Data Mining; Deep Learning; Disease Control; Feature Extraction; Heterogeneous Networks; Image Processing; Internet Of Things; Neural Networks; Precision Agriculture; Sensor Networks; Alexnet; Convolutional Neural Network; Corn Disease; Decision Level Fusion; Features Extraction; Heterogeneous Data; Multi-context; Multi-modelling; Plant (biology); Plant Biology; Precision Agriculture; Resnext; Smart Agricultures; Vgg-16; Crops","Classification (of information); Cultivation; Data handling; Data mining; Deep learning; Disease control; Feature extraction; Heterogeneous networks; Image processing; Internet of things; Neural networks; Precision agriculture; Sensor networks; Alexnet; Convolutional neural network; Corn disease; Decision level fusion; Features extraction; Heterogeneous data; Multi-context; Multi-modelling; Plant (biology); Plant biology; Precision Agriculture; Resnext; Smart agricultures; VGG-16; Crops","","","","Fan, Xijian, Leaf image based plant disease identification using transfer learning and feature fusion, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 196, (2022); Patil, Rutuja Rajendra, Rice-Fusion: A Multimodality Data Fusion Framework for Rice Disease Diagnosis, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 5207-5222, (2022); Feng, Leib, Investigation on Data Fusion of Multisource Spectral Data for Rice Leaf Diseases Identification Using Machine Learning Methods, Frontiers in Plant Science, 11, (2020); Masood, Fahad, AI-Enabled Traffic Control Prioritization in Software-Defined IoT Networks for Smart Agriculture, Sensors, 23, 19, (2023); Sun, Cuimin, SE-VisionTransformer: Hybrid Network for Diagnosing Sugarcane Leaf Diseases Based on Attention Mechanism, Sensors, 23, 20, (2023); Patil, Manoj A., Smartphone and IoT based system for integrated farm monitoring, 1 1, pp. 471-478, (2020); Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2012); Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition, (2014); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016); Xie, Saining, Aggregated residual transformations for deep neural networks, 2017-January, pp. 5987-5995, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184002114"

This paper provides a focused review of recent advancements in deep learning-enabled computer vision techniques tailored specifically for greenhouse environments. First, deep learning and computer vision fundamentals are briefly introduced. Over 100 studies from 2020 to date are then comprehensively reviewed in which these technologies were applied within greenhouses for growth monitoring, disease detection, yield estimation, and other tasks. The techniques, datasets, models, and overall performance results reported in the literature are analyzed. Tables and figures showcase real-world implementations and results synthesized from current research. Key challenges are also outlined related to aspects like model adaptability, lack of sufficient labeled greenhouse data, computational constraints, the need for multi-modal sensor fusion, and other areas needing further investigation. Future trends and prospects are discussed to provide guidance for researchers exploring computer vision in the niche greenhouse domain.

In this work, an Internet of Drones architecture was firstly presented for low altitude scenarios. Within the presented framework, each drone can communicate with each other and the ground base stations while traveling along a fixed route. Since anomalous activities can significantly affect the normal operation of the Internet of Drones, it becomes critical to differentiate the normal surroundings from the abnormal surroundings around the drones. On the other hand, the vision transformer-based deep learning models have exhibited their superiority even over the convolutional neural network-based architectures due to the adoption of global receptive field. Bearing the above-mentioned issue in mind, we propose a novel deep learning pipeline by leveraging the vision transformer model for anomaly detection in the low altitude context. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1 score of the proposed approach on a manually-collected dataset are 91.2%, 92.5%, 92.2%, and 93.7%, respectively.

Its healthy cultivation not only concerns national food security but also profoundly affects the regulation and trade patterns of international food resources. To assess wheat planting density and predict yields, this study designs a lightweight wheat detection network based on NanoDet. The network encoding process incorporates Ghost convolution, which introduces more feature maps during the convolution process using fewer parameters and computing resources, thereby enhancing the network's computational efficiency and operational speed. Additionally, a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is employed to optimize the information transfer and fusion between feature layers, enhancing the model's capability to process multi-scale features, and further improving performance and efficiency. Experiments conducted on the public Global Wheat Head Dataset (GWHD) show that the model improves detection accuracy and speed without significantly increasing the size of the weight model file. The average detection precision of wheat heads reached 84.3%, with a detection speed of up to 14.3ms per frame, and the weight model file size is approximately 4.3MB. This rapid inference speed and minimal model size provide significant support for embedded devices, offering robust backing for the field application of intelligent agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Intelligent Agriculture; Lightweight; Nanodet; Wheat Ear Detection; Convolution; Cultivation; Food Security; Food Supply; Network Security; Networks (circuits); Smart Agriculture; Detection Networks; Detection Speed; Feature Pyramid; Global Population; Intelligent Agriculture; Lightweight; Nanodet; Pyramid Network; Staple Crops; Wheat Ear Detection; Computational Efficiency","Convolution; Cultivation; Food security; Food supply; Network security; Networks (circuits); Smart agriculture; Detection networks; Detection speed; Feature pyramid; Global population; Intelligent agriculture; Lightweight; Nanodet; Pyramid network; Staple crops; Wheat ear detection; Computational efficiency","","","This work is granted by The Major Project of Scientific and Technological Innovation 2030 (2021ZD0113603).","Shen, Xiaojun, A lightweight network for improving wheat ears detection and counting based on YOLOv5s, Frontiers in Plant Science, 14, (2023); Li, Jingbo, Wheat ear recognition based on retinanet and transfer learning, Sensors, 21, 14, (2021); Study on Wheat Ear Detection Method Based on Convolution Neural Network J, (2023); Sun, Jun, Method for the multiscale perceptual counting of wheat ears based on UAV images, Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering, 37, 23, pp. 136-144, (2021); Miao, Di, Foreign Object Detection Method of Conveyor Belt Based on Improved Nanodet, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 23046-23052, (2023); Chen, Jun, EFFECTIVE FEATURE FUSION NETWORK IN BIFPN FOR SMALL OBJECT DETECTION, Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP, 2021-September, pp. 699-703, (2021); Han, Kai, GhostNet: More features from cheap operations, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1577-1586, (2020); Liu, Lizhao, An improved YOLOv5-based algorithm for small wheat spikes detection, Signal, Image and Video Processing, 17, 8, pp. 4485-4493, (2023); Wang, Meng, Wheat ear detection using anchor-free ObjectBox model with attention mechanism, Signal, Image and Video Processing, 17, 7, pp. 3425-3432, (2023); Yu, Chushi, SAR ship detection based on improved YOLOv5 and BiFPN, ICT Express, 10, 1, pp. 28-33, (2024)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","8th Asian Conference on Artificial Intelligence Technology, ACAIT 2024","","Fuzhou","209481","","9798331517090","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009107389"

However, in southern regions, the parcels tend to be small, structurally complex, and fragmented, posing challenges for precise extraction using existing convolutional neural network (CNNs) based on deep learning. To address these issues, we introduced a novel neural network model, i.e., CLCFormer, which combines CNN and Swin-Transformer. This model leverages the strengths of CNN in capturing fine-grained spatial details and the ability of Transformer in extracting global semantic features. We introduced three distinct modules to refine the learning of spatial features, enhance the accuracy of parcel extraction in mountainous and hilly regions, and mitigate the boundary blurriness caused by occluded objects. Finally, we employed a post-processing method to achieve regularized parcel extraction. Our study was tested on GF-2 high-resolution remote sensing datasets from Nanping and Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China. Our proposed method achieved a prediction precision of 86.68% and a recall rate of 85.3% on the Nanping test set, and maintaining a transfer precision of 85.67% on the Fuzhou dataset. Compared to other advanced parcel extraction models, our method demonstrates the highest performance. Moreover, the extracted parcels have the highest consistency with the actual distribution patterns of agricultural parcels.

A big obstacle to increasing agricultural outputs is the inefficiency of conventional methods and the absence of accurate instruments for predicting crop yields. While various machine learning techniques have been used by several researchers to forecast yields, the difficulty lies in developing models that adequately account for regional nuances. To overcome this problem, this study proposed a novel machine learning-based approach for crop yield prediction focused on the Sylhet region, Bangladesh with a large unique dataset named ""EcoRiceDynamics (1971-2021).""Four models - Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted, and K-Nearest Neighbors are evaluated to improve forecast precision. Performance was measured using the R2 value and error reduction metrics. Our results show that the Gradient Boosted model achieved the highest R2 value of 95% and MAE 6.71%, indicating its superior fit to the dataset.

If untreated, these illnesses can lead to substantial yield losses and negatively impact agricultural output. Conventional disease diagnosis methods, which frequently depend on expert manual inspection, are both time-consuming and labor-intensive, as well as prone to human errors. Recent improvements in deep learning-based image classification approaches have shown considerable potential in automating the identification of plant diseases, offering a scalable and more dependable alternative to manual inspections. In this research, we proposed a Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning methodology for the classification of potato leaf diseases using two publicly available potato leaf datasets.

This project seeks to increase agricultural productivity and efficiency through the application of modern deep-learning algorithms. The methodology begins with the preprocessing of a comprehensive dataset of maize crop images. These images are resized to 224x224 pixels to ensure uniformity and standardization across the dataset, which is crucial for the effective training of the CNN. Pixel values are also standardized to optimize the model's preparation phase. Transfer learning is employed, utilizing pre-trained ImageNet weights, which facilitates faster convergence and improves predictive accuracy by leveraging the vast amount of knowledge already embedded in the EfficientNetB0 model. EfficientNetB0 serves as the foundational architecture due to its balanced trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. The model's design includes dropout regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting, which is essential for maintaining generalizability to unseen data. Dense layers are incorporated for hierarchical feature extraction, while global average pooling is used for feature aggregation, reducing the risk of overfitting and maintaining model efficiency. Batch normalization is used to provide consistent learning rates across all layers of the model and to expedite and stabilize the training process. TensorFlow and Keras, powerful deep learning frameworks, are utilized to build and train the model. The classification results demonstrate the model's capability to accurately distinguish between different growth stages of maize crops based solely on images. This accuracy is validated through various benchmarks that assess the model's performance during both the training and validation phases, focusing on metrics such as loss and accuracy. The model's proficiency in accurately predicting maize crop growth stages is further evidenced by its performance on an unseen test set, showcasing its potential for scaling in agricultural monitoring systems. By integrating advanced deep learning techniques, this research contributes significantly to the field of agricultural technology, optimizing production management practices and enhancing yield prediction accuracy. While the primary focus has been on maize, the model shows promise for application to a broader range of crops. Future improvements may include refining the dataset and developing more sophisticated neural networks to achieve even higher accuracy across diverse crops and agricultural environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Network; Crop Growth Stages; Efficientnetb0; Image Classification; Maize Crop; Precision Agriculture; Grain (agricultural Product); Information Management; Project Management; Seed; Convolutional Neural Network; Crop Growth; Crop Growth Stage; Efficientnetb0; Growth Stages; Images Classification; Learning Approach; Maize Crop; Overfitting; Precision Agriculture; Agricultural Robots","Grain (agricultural product); Information management; Project management; Seed; Convolutional neural network; Crop growth; Crop growth stage; Efficientnetb0; Growth stages; Images classification; Learning approach; Maize crop; Overfitting; Precision Agriculture; Agricultural robots","","","","Krizhevsky, Alex, ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2, pp. 1097-1105, (2012); Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition, (2014); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016); Efficientnet Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks, (2019); Sandler, Mark, MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4510-4520, (2018); Huang, Gao, Densely connected convolutional networks, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017-January, pp. 2261-2269, (2017); Pan, Sinno Jialin, A survey on transfer learning, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 22, 10, pp. 1345-1359, (2010); Yosinski, Jason, How transferable are features in deep neural networks?, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 4, January, pp. 3320-3328, (2014); Chollet, François, Xception: Deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017-January, pp. 1800-1807, (2017); Russakovsky, Olga, ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, International Journal of Computer Vision, 115, 3, pp. 211-252, (2015)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Trends and Pattern Recognition, ICAITPR 2024","","Hyderabad","208317","","9798350368000","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004408076"

Conventional techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest Classifier (RFC) have constraints in accurately identifying early blight, which can lead to inadequate use of fungicides. In order to address these restrictions, this study suggests a structure that combines the Internet of Things (IoT) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is improved by using a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). The CNN-CBAM model, trained on Kaggle datasets, attained a precision of 0.95, an F1 score of 0.93, and a recall of 0.94, surpassing the accuracy rates of the SVM and RFC models, which were 0.87 and 0.89, respectively. The suggested method improves the early identification of early blight and the use of fungicides, hence enhancing crop management. It provides enhanced precision and dependability compared to current techniques, rendering it a useful asset for contemporary agriculture and a basis for future investigations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Technology; Convolutional Neural Network - Convolutional Block Attention Module (cnn-cbam); Crop Yield Optimization; Deep Learning; Disease Management; Early Blight Detection; Fungicide Application; Internet Of Things (iot); Kaggle Datasets; Machine Learning; Potato Crops; Precision Agriculture; Random Forest Classifier; Support Vector Machine; Tomato Crops; Convolutional Neural Networks; Decision Trees; Deep Learning; Fungicides; Random Forests; Support Vector Machines; Agricultural Technologies; Convolutional Neural Network; Convolutional Neural Network - Convolutional Block Attention Module; Crop Yield; Crop Yield Optimization; Disease Management; Early Blight Detection; Fungicide Application; Internet Of Thing; Kaggle Dataset; Machine-learning; Potato Crop; Precision Agriculture; Random Forest Classifier; Support Vectors Machine; Tomato Crops; Yield Optimization; Fruits","Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Deep learning; Fungicides; Random forests; Support vector machines; Agricultural technologies; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network - convolutional block attention module; Crop yield; Crop yield optimization; Disease management; Early blight detection; Fungicide application; Internet of thing; Kaggle dataset; Machine-learning; Potato crop; Precision Agriculture; Random forest classifier; Support vectors machine; Tomato crops; Yield optimization; Fruits","","","","Foolad, Majid R., Genetics, genomics and breeding of late blight and early blight resistance in tomato, Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences, 27, 2, pp. 75-107, (2008); Nowicki, Marcin, Late blight of Tomato, pp. 241-265, (2013); Afr J Microbiol Res, (2014); Bessadat, Nabahat, Alternaria species associated with early blight epidemics on tomato and other Solanaceae crops in northwestern Algeria, European Journal of Plant Pathology, 148, 1, pp. 181-197, (2017); Chaerani, R., Tomato early blight (Alternaria solani): The pathogen, genetics, and breeding for resistance, Journal of General Plant Pathology, 72, 6, pp. 335-347, (2006); Atherton, Daniel, Hyperspectral remote sensing for advanced detection of early blight (Alternaria solani) disease in potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants prior to visual disease symptoms, (2017); Prabhakar, Maheswari, Deep learning based assessment of disease severity for early blight in tomato crop, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 79, 39-40, pp. 28773-28784, (2020); Zhao, Jichun, The study and application of the IOT technology in agriculture, 2, pp. 462-465, (2010); Kanupuru, Priyanka, Survey on IoT and its applications in agriculture, (2018); Quy, Vu Khanh, IoT-Enabled Smart Agriculture: Architecture, Applications, and Challenges, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 7, (2022)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2024 International Conference on Distributed Systems, Computer Networks and Cybersecurity, ICDSCNC 2024","","Bengaluru; Sri Krishna Institute of Technology (SKIT)","207996","","9798350375442","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002900123"

This project aims at developing a system of wheat diseases diagnosis based on the integration of CapsNet into IoT. This dataset includes the images of different types of wheat diseases to include STB, stem rust, Septoria, tannin spot and powdery mildew, that affects Tunisia. Pre-processing and data augmentation bring in conformity to methods of training and improving the non uniformity and a diversified type of the dataset. CapsNet also has the feature called affiliative invariance which helps to solve the problem of varying camera angles and increases the model's accuracy. Even deeper capabilities can be achieved in transfer learning within hyperparameter tuning of the pre-trained CapsNets models. Applications of IoT empowers a continuous monitoring of the disease that affects crops, extensive and efficient spraying of biopesticides in agriculture. Wheat grains that are transformed into sensors are able to track changes in their environment; on the other hand, cameras of specific functions capture image data. Prompts and advisories from time to time assist farmers in preventing such challenges; hence, enhancing the productions and qualities.

Through a systematic literature review of 13 relevant studies, we examined various trap designs and attractant combinations used for CBB detection. Additionally, we developed a prototype device equipped with an ESP32-CAM microcontroller and solar power capability for continuous field monitoring. The device captures high-resolution images at 15-minute intervals. A preliminary database of 500 images was created. Our findings suggest that effective trap placement typically ranges from 1.2 to 1.5 meters above ground, with a 3:1 methanol-ethanol mixture serving as the optimal attractant.

In developing countries, nearly 86% of farmers rely on small plots of land, contributing to low yields due to traditional farming methods. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an architecture that connects Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for reliable data acquisition, alongside a deep learning model for efficient pest classification, aimed at improving the productivity and sustainability of smallholder farms. The proposed solution integrates IoT and WSN to create an efficient system for collecting real-time environmental parameters, such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and pest activity, using sensors deployed across farmlands. A comprehensive dataset is then used to train a deep learning model for predictive pest classification. The model, based on EfficientNetB4, achieved an impressive accuracy of 90.17%, with precision, recall, and F1-score values of 90.10%, 90.17%, and 90.02%, respectively, demonstrating the efficacy of deep learning in pest detection. This paper highlights the role of deep learning in enhancing pest classification and presents a sustainable architecture for data acquisition, enabling farmers to gain valuable insights into pest activity and optimize their practices. This approach not only contributes to the ""United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal Number 2: Zero Hunger"", promoting sustainable agriculture, but also significantly improves food security and farming resilience, revolutionizing smallholder agriculture to meet global food production demands. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Efficientnet; Internet Of Things; Machine Learning; Pest Classification; Transfer Learning; Wireless Sensor Networks; Federated Learning; Soil Moisture; Deep Learning; Efficientnet; Global Population; Learning Models; Machine-learning; Network Frameworks; Pest Classification; Sensors Network; Transfer Learning; Wireless Sensor; Smart Agriculture","Federated learning; Soil moisture; Deep learning; Efficientnet; Global population; Learning models; Machine-learning; Network frameworks; Pest classification; Sensors network; Transfer learning; Wireless sensor; Smart agriculture","","","","Agnihotri, Vivek Kumar, Machine Learning based Pest Identification in Paddy Plants, pp. 246-250, (2019); Mekonnen, Yemeserach, Review - Machine Learning Techniques in Wireless Sensor Network Based Precision Agriculture, Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 167, 3, (2020); Haseeb, Khalid, An energy efficient and secure IoT-based WSN framework: An application to smart agriculture, Sensors, 20, 7, (2020); Plant Disease Detection Using Cnn, (2020); Marković, Dušan, Prediction of pest insect appearance using sensors and machine learning, Sensors, 21, 14, (2021); Bayih, Amsale Zelalem, Utilization of Internet of Things and Wireless Sensor Networks for Sustainable Smallholder Agriculture, Sensors, 22, 9, (2022); Udham Singh, Kamred Udham, An Artificial Neural Network-Based Pest Identification and Control in Smart Agriculture Using Wireless Sensor Networks, Journal of Food Quality, 2022, (2022); Domingues, Tiago, Machine Learning for Detection and Prediction of Crop Diseases and Pests: A Comprehensive Survey, Agriculture (Switzerland), 12, 9, (2022); Chithambarathanu, M., Survey on crop pest detection using deep learning and machine learning approaches, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 82, 27, pp. 42277-42310, (2023); Kaggle, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd IEEE International Conference on Emerging Research in Computational Science, ICERCS 2024","","Coimbatore; Karpagam Academy of Higher Education (Deemed to be University)","207277","","9798331534950","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000701764"

The limitations of traditional manual inspection methods-marked by inefficiency and a lack of scalability-are particularly pronounced across extensive agricultural landscapes. In response, this study explores the cutting-edge integration of remote sensing techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) in pest detection, positioning these technologies as transformative tools in modern agriculture. Advanced remote sensing systems, including satellite imagery, aerial drones, and ground-based sensors, equipped with multispectral, hyperspectral, and thermal imaging capabilities, provide a nuanced understanding of crop health and pest vulnerability, enabling early and precise detection of infestations. Concurrently, AI's capacity for rapid and accurate analysis of vast datasets facilitates real-time monitoring and predictive analytics, offering a proactive approach to pest management. The synergistic application of these technologies promises to revolutionize pest control, significantly reducing reliance on chemical pesticides and mitigating environmental impacts. However, challenges persist, particularly in ensuring the robustness of data acquisition and the adaptability of AI models across diverse agro-ecological zones.

Recent studies of using Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) to retrieve SM have shown that the joint use of data and models is an effective method. However, data and models are often accompanied by two types of uncertainties (i.e., data uncertainty and model uncertainty), which can lead to retrieved results with high uncertainty resulting in false reliability. In this study, we propose a new Bayesian neural network (BNN) framework composed of two techniques: Monte-Carlo (MC)-dropout and Deep Ensembles. It quantifies the uncertainty and feeds it back to the framework to ultimately reduce the uncertainty in the retrieved results and improve accuracy. To verify the proposed framework, we conduct experiments using in situ data sets and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data sets respectively. The results show that MC-dropout can improve the correlation coefficient (R) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 8%∼21% and 7%∼20%, compared to basic multilayer perceptron (MLP). Deep Ensembles can improve the R and RMSE by 9%∼36% and 11%∼25%. Concerning uncertainty, MC-dropout and Deep Ensembles can decrease the uncertainty by 37%∼60% and 82%∼84% relative to maximum a posteriori (MAP), respectively.

Existing models face significant challenges in balancing lightweight requirements and precise classification of rice disease types due to the noisy background and scattered distribution of disease symptoms in real-world environments. To address the above issues, this study proposes DGLNet, a novel lightweight and highly accurate network for rice disease identification. DGLNet includes two low-complexity modules, the global attention module (GAM) and the dynamic representation module (DRM). The GAM is designed to capture key information in complex noisy scenes, thus improving the generalization ability of the model. Meanwhile, the self-developed four-dimensional flexible convolution (4D-FConv) in the DRM can dynamically generate adaptive convolutional kernel parameters from four dimensions. This allows DRM to maintain diversity among different sample inputs to enhance the model's ability to fit complex functions. As a result, DRM enhances feature representation without the need for additional network layers and channels. The proposed method achieves 99.82% and 99.71% recognition accuracy on two real plant disease datasets, outperforming current popular methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is not only computationally lightweight, but also capable of accurately identifying rice diseases in real-life scenarios. Furthermore, this study provides robust technical support for disease identification and control and offers guidance for the implementation of agricultural intelligence and precision farming. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Network; Dynamic Convolution; Lightweight; Rice Disease Identification; Artificial Neural Network; Crop Yield; Food Quality; Precision Agriculture; Rice","artificial neural network; crop yield; food quality; precision agriculture; rice","","","This work is supported by the Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China ( 2021JJ50074 , 2022JJ50016 , 2023JJ50096 ), the Science and Technology Plan Project of Hunan Province ( 2016TP1020 ), the 14th Five-Year Plan Key Disciplines and Application-oriented Special Disciplines of Hunan Province (Xiangjiaotong [2022] 351 ), and the Innovation Platform Open Fund of Hengyang Normal University ( 2021HSKFJJ039 ).","Asibi, Aziiba Emmanuel, Rice blast: A disease with implications for global food security, Agronomy, 9, 8, (2019); Baser, Preeti, TomConv: An Improved CNN Model for Diagnosis of Diseases in Tomato Plant Leaves, Procedia Computer Science, 218, pp. 1825-1833, (2023); Cvpr, (2019); Chen, Junde, Identification of plant disease images via a squeeze-and-excitation MobileNet model and twice transfer learning, IET Image Processing, 15, 5, pp. 1115-1127, (2021); Chen, Junde, Identification of rice plant diseases using lightweight attention networks, Expert Systems with Applications, 169, (2021); Xception Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions, (2017); Arxiv, (2021); Gandhi, Rutu, Plant disease detection using CNNs and GANs as an augmentative approach, pp. 1-5, (2018); Guo, Yuzhi, Deep Ensemble Learning with Atrous Spatial Pyramid Networks for Protein Secondary Structure Prediction, Biomolecules, 12, 6, (2022); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","15749541","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173449518"

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of statistical and machine learning methods to explain and predict crop yield across thousands of farmers’ fields in contrasting farming systems worldwide. Methods: A large database of 10,940 field-year combinations from three countries in different stages of agricultural intensification was analyzed. Random effects models were used to partition crop yield variability and random forest models were used to explain and predict crop yield within a cross-validation scheme with data re-sampling over space and time. Results: Yield variability in relative terms was smallest for wheat and barley in the Netherlands and for wheat in Ethiopia, intermediate for rice in the Philippines, and greatest for maize in Ethiopia. Random forest models comprising a total of 87 variables explained a maximum of 65 % of cereal yield variability in the Netherlands and less than 45 % of cereal yield variability in Ethiopia and in the Philippines. Crop management related variables were important to explain and predict cereal yields in Ethiopia, while predictive (i.e., known before the growing season) climatic variables and explanatory (i.e., known during or after the growing season) climatic variables were most important to explain and predict cereal yield variability in the Philippines and in the Netherlands, respectively. Finally, model cross-validation for regions or years not seen during model training reduced the R2 considerably for most crop x country combinations, while for wheat in the Netherlands this was model dependent. Conclusion: Big data from farmers’ fields is useful to explain on-farm yield variability to some extent, but not to predict it across time and space. Significance: The results call for moderate expectations towards big data and machine learning in agronomic studies, particularly for smallholder farms in the tropics where model performance was poorest independently of the variables considered and the cross-validation scheme used. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Linear Mixed Models; Machine Learning; Model Accuracy; Model Precision; Sustainable Intensification; Agricultural Intensification; Agricultural Modeling; Agronomy; Alternative Agriculture; Crop Plant; Crop Yield; Precision Agriculture; Smallholder; Ethiopia; Netherlands; Philippines","agricultural intensification; agricultural modeling; agronomy; alternative agriculture; crop plant; crop yield; precision agriculture; smallholder; Ethiopia; Netherlands; Philippines","","","Funding text 1: We thank Banchayehu Assefa (WUR/CIMMYT) and Moti Jaleta (CIMMYT) for helping with the preparation of the data sets used in the analysis for maize and wheat in Ethiopia, and Ma.

It is alarming to note that India's agriculture rate is declining steeply. Climate change, environmental pollution, and soil erosion are well-known factors affecting crop productivity. The increasing prevalence of plant diseases is also a significant factor affecting agriculture. Early disease detection and mitigation actions based on identified conditions in the plants are critical in increasing crop productivity. This study considers a machine learning model for detecting disease in cashew leaves. This work concentrates on Anthracnose disease, which leads to severe yield loss when it affects the cashew plant. In this regard, cashew leaves are collected and used to train various machine learning classifiers to identify and classify the disease. This work focuses on the segmentation and classification of leaves using multiple Machine Learning models. Basic segmentation approaches like Global Threshold, Adaptive Gaussian, Adaptive Mean, Otsu, Canny, Sobel, and K-Means, and Machine Learning models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifiers are employed. The final classification employs a Hard and Soft voting classifier and the Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers. Finally, we observe that K-Means segmentation with Random Forest outperforms other classifiers. The accuracy obtained from the Random Forest classifier is 96.7% for the CCDDB dataset, and the accuracy obtained from the Random Forest classifier is 99.7% for the PDDB dataset. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anthracnose Disease; Leaf Image Segmentation; Machine Learning Techniques; Precision Agriculture; Classification (of Information); Climate Change; Crops; Decision Trees; Disease Control; Forestry; Gaussian Distribution; Image Enhancement; K-means Clustering; Learning Systems; Plants (botany); Random Forests; Anthracnose Disease; Crop Productivity; Gaussians; Images Segmentations; Leaf Image Segmentation; Leaf Images; Machine Learning Models; Machine Learning Techniques; Precision Agriculture; Image Segmentation","Classification (of information); Climate change; Crops; Decision trees; Disease control; Forestry; Gaussian distribution; Image enhancement; K-means clustering; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Random forests; Anthracnose disease; Crop productivity; Gaussians; Images segmentations; Leaf image segmentation; Leaf images; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Precision Agriculture; Image segmentation","","","We are grateful to Dr. Jeyalakshmi C, Professor, Plant Pathology, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru College of Agriculture and Research, Karaikal- 609603, UT of Puducherry, India., for validation of our Cashew Crop Disease DataBase (CCDDB).","Kumar, Munish Praveen, Plant Species Recognition Using Morphological Features and Adaptive Boosting Methodology, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 163912-163918, (2019); International Journal of Biosciences, (2017); Adv Plants Agric Res, (2017); International Journal of Computer Applications, (2021); Singh, Vijai, Sunflower leaf diseases detection using image segmentation based on particle swarm optimization, Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture, 3, pp. 62-68, (2019); Bendib, Mohamed Mokhtar, Automatic segmentation of brain MRI through stationary wavelet transform and random forests, Pattern Analysis and Applications, 18, 4, pp. 829-843, (2015); Acar, Emrullah, Automatic identification of cassava leaf diseases utilizing morphological hidden patterns and multi-feature textures with a distributed structure-based classification approach, Journal of Plant Diseases and Protection, 129, 3, pp. 605-621, (2022); Karlekar, Aditya, SoyNet: Soybean leaf diseases classification, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 172, (2020); Bhagwat, Radhika, Comprehensive Multilayer Convolutional Neural Network for Plant Disease Detection, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 12, 1, pp. 204-211, (2021); Barbedo, Jayme G.A., Annotated plant pathology databases for image-based detection and recognition of diseases, IEEE Latin America Transactions, 16, 6, pp. 1749-1757, (2018)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","18631703; 18631711","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160231336"

While vertical farming methods are not well-suited for fruit cultivation, substrate-based cultivation is commonly practiced. Vertical farming methods use no soil for cultivation of the plants, and the cultivation is done in vertically stacked layers. Therefore, smaller herbs are best suited for such cultivation, whereas, the majority of the fruit trees are big and woody. Therefore, vertical farming methods are not well suited for fruit trees. However, to maximize fruit production, smarter substrate cultivation methods are needed. Utilizing remote sensing techniques, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, agriculture sensors, and cloud computing, allows for precision agriculture and smart farming in autonomous systems. Nevertheless, a lack of understanding of fruit nutrient requirements, growing conditions, and soil health conditions can result in reduced fruit production. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an intelligent model based on machine learning that recommends the best fruit to grow based on prevailing soil and climatic conditions. The system is trained on a dataset that includes details on eleven different fruits, such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The model takes into account the soil type and nutrient contents to recommend the most suitable fruit to grow in the prevailing climate. To enhance the model's efficiency, two novel techniques, Gradient-based Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB), have been incorporated. The results show that the proposed system has achieved 99% accuracy in recommending the right fruit based on the given environmental conditions. As a result, this system has the potential to significantly improve the profitability of the pomology industry and boost national economies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Productivity; Cloud Computing; Internet Of Things; Machine Learning; Pomology; Precision Agriculture; Cloud Computing; Cultivation; Forestry; Internet Of Things; Machine Learning; Nutrients; Orchards; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Soils; Substrates; Agricultural Productivity; Cloud-computing; Cultivation Substrates; Fruit Production; Fruit Trees; Machine-learning; Pomology; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing Techniques; Stacked Layer; Fruits","Cloud computing; Cultivation; Forestry; Internet of things; Machine learning; Nutrients; Orchards; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Soils; Substrates; Agricultural productivity; Cloud-computing; Cultivation substrates; Fruit production; Fruit trees; Machine-learning; Pomology; Precision Agriculture; Remote sensing techniques; Stacked layer; Fruits","","","","de Alwis, Sandya, A survey on smart farming data, applications and techniques, Computers in Industry, 138, (2022); Kumar Trivedi, Naresh Kumar, Early detection and classification of tomato leaf disease using high-performance deep neural network, Sensors, 21, 23, (2021); Amiri-Zarandi, Mohammad, A Platform Approach to Smart Farm Information Processing, Agriculture (Switzerland), 12, 6, (2022); Rakhra, Manik, Implementing Machine Learning for Smart Farming to Forecast Farmers' Interest in Hiring Equipment, Journal of Food Quality, 2022, (2022); Shaikh, Tawseef Ayoub, Towards leveraging the role of machine learning and artificial intelligence in precision agriculture and smart farming, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 198, (2022); Castells, Pablo, Novelty and Diversity in Recommender Systems, pp. 603-646, (2022); Gunawardana, Asela, Evaluating Recommender Systems, pp. 547-601, (2022); Hui, Bei, Personalized recommendation system based on knowledge embedding and historical behavior, Applied Intelligence, 52, 1, pp. 954-966, (2022); Cravero, A.

Paddy diseases have significant detrimental effects on crop yield and quality, necessitating timely and accurate detection for effective disease management. Deep learning has shown promise in identifying plant diseases from leaf images, including those in paddy crops. However, the presence of slight variations among different types of paddy diseases poses a significant generalizability challenge. In this study, for the first time, we introduce a lesion-aware visual transformer for accurate and reliable detection of paddy leaf diseases through identifying discriminatory lesion features. A Novel multi-scale contextual feature extraction network is presented to enable capturing a contextual local and global representation of disease features at different scales and channels. Then, a weakly supervised Paddy Lesion Localization (PLL) unit was presented to locate distinctive lesions in paddy leaves that provide the model with discriminative leaf regions that can guide the final classification decision.

It is important for farmers to understand which crops are suitable for different soil types based on their characteristics. Due to the vast variety of soil types worldwide, farmers often struggle to choose the most profitable crop for their land. To improve crop yields, a crop selection system has been developed using GBRT-based deep learning surrogate models. Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT) has been combined with a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to determine the most optimal hyperparameters for the deep neural network. The optimized hyperparameters are then applied during the testing phase. Further, the impact of each input parameter on the individual outputs is evaluated using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The crop recommendation system comprises data preparation, classification, and performance evaluation modules. A classification method based on confusion matrices and performance matrices, as well as feature analysis using density plots and correlation plots, follows. The crop selection system categorizes the experimental dataset into 12 classes, with three for each of the four crops. The dataset includes soil-specific physical and chemical features such as sand, silt, clay, pH, electric conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). The developed surrogate model is highly accurate, precise, and reliable, with an F1-Score of 1.0 for all classes in the dataset, indicating exact accuracy and recall. The DNN-based classification model achieves an average classification accuracy of 1.00. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian Optimization; Crop Recommendation System; Deep Learning; Precision Agriculture; Soil Suitability Analysis; Agricultural Soil; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Network; Optimization; Organic Carbon; Precision Agriculture; Soil Nutrient","agricultural soil; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; optimization; organic carbon; precision agriculture; soil nutrient","","","This work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology ( MOST 111-2221-E-007-063-MY3 , 111-2622-8-007-008-TE2 , and 110-2923-E-007-008 -) and the Ministry of Education (subsidy for talentCultivation in international competition—College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science—5G-AloT Technology and Application Research Center) in Taiwan.","undefined, (2021); Babu, Satish, A software model for precision agriculture for small and marginal farmers, pp. 352-355, (2013); Bagherzadeh, Ali, Modeling land suitability evaluation for wheat production by parametric and TOPSIS approaches using GIS, northeast of Iran, Modeling Earth Systems and Environment, 2, 3, (2016); International Journal of Computer Applications, (2020); Cah Options Mediterr, (1993); Bhat, Showkat Ahmad, Big Data and AI Revolution in Precision Agriculture: Survey and Challenges, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 110209-110222, (2021); Bhat, Showkat Ahmad, On the classification of a greenhouse environment for a rose crop based on ai-based surrogate models, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 21, (2021); Bhat, Showkat Ahmad, Correlating the Ambient Conditions and Performance Indicators of the LoRaWAN via Surrogate Gaussian Process-Based Bidirectional LSTM Stacked Autoencoder, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 20, 3, pp. 3413-3427, (2023); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Capinha, César, Deep learning for supervised classification of temporal data in ecology, Ecological Informatics, 61, (2021)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","15749541","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153627290"

Benefiting from local spatial perception, deep learning based object extraction methods have achieved satisfactory performances in extracting geo-objects. However, they fail to work for large-scale greenhouse extraction since the objects are sparsely distributed in the background and densely distributed in the foreground, where the local spatial perception causes redundant computation and false detection problems. In this paper, we propose a layout attention network (LANet) framework for large-scale greenhouse extraction using remote sensing imagery, which replaces the local spatial perception with spatial layout perception, i.e., a sparse global layout to identify the sparse background and a dense local layout to identify the dense foreground. To address the shortcoming of the sparse background, which leads to redundant computation, a sparse global layout awareness module is formulated as a scene classifier. This accommodates the global layout attention map of the global scene features by adopting a layout-shared convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone for generating class-agnostic layout priors and global channel attention for aggregating discriminative global layout features, ensuring robust sparse background identification. Then, to alleviate the problem of the dense foreground, which causes false detection, a dense local layout awareness module is proposed to incorporate the local layout attention map and rotated region of interest (RRoI) features. The RRoI features are then further embedded to guide the initial RRoIs for object location refinement by aligning the initial RRoI locations in a layout-sensitive attention mechanism and achieving semantic enhancement by taking the local layout density as a semantic prior to assign a reliable class score map. The experimental results obtained on an agricultural greenhouse benchmark dataset and a large-scale agricultural greenhouse extraction dataset illustrate that the proposed framework can outperform the state-of-the-art object extraction methods in both speed and accuracy, and has a high generalization ability for large-scale dense object extraction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dense Foreground; Large-scale Greenhouse Extraction; Layout Attention; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing Imagery; Sparse Background; Deep Learning; Greenhouses; Large Dataset; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Agricultural Greenhouse; Dense Foreground; Large-scale Greenhouse Extraction; Large-scales; Layout Attention; Object Extraction; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing Imagery; Sparse Background; Spatial Perception; Extraction; Data Set; Greenhouse Ecosystem; Imagery; Numerical Method; Perception; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; China","Deep learning; Greenhouses; Large dataset; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Agricultural greenhouse; Dense foreground; Large-scale greenhouse extraction; Large-scales; Layout attention; Object extraction; Precision Agriculture; Remote sensing imagery; Sparse background; Spatial perception; Extraction; data set; greenhouse ecosystem; imagery; numerical method; perception; precision agriculture; remote sensing; China","","","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No. 2022YFB3903404 , in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 42171336 , and U22A20567 .","Agüera-Vega, Francisco, Using texture analysis to improve per-pixel classification of very high resolution images for mapping plastic greenhouses, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 63, 6, pp. 635-646, (2008); Aguilar, Manuel Ángel, Optimizing multiresolution segmentation for extracting plastic greenhouses from worldview-3 imagery, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 76, pp. 31-40, (2018); Chen, Dingyuan, Urban road mapping based on an end-to-end road vectorization mapping network framework, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 178, pp. 345-365, (2021); Chen, Liangchieh, Encoder-decoder with atrous separable convolution for semantic image segmentation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11211 LNCS, pp. 833-851, (2018); Cheng, Gong, Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification: Benchmark and State of the Art, Proceedings of the IEEE, 105, 10, pp. 1865-1883, (2017); Cheng, Gong, Anchor-Free Oriented Proposal Generator for Object Detection, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 60, (2022); Cheng, Gong, Dual-Aligned Oriented Detector, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 60, (2022); Deng, Jia, ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database, pp. 248-255, (2009); undefined, (2019); Druzhkov, Pavel N., A survey of deep learning methods and software tools for image classification and object detection, Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis, 26, 1, pp. 9-15, (2016)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09242716","","IRSEE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159113918"

Since NUE-related soil characteristics such as water holding capacity and organic matter are likely to vary at small scales (< 1 ha), understanding the influence of soil characteristics on NUE at the subfield scale (< 32 ha) could increase fertilizer NUE. Here, we quantify NUE in four conventionally managed dryland winter-wheat fields in Montana following multiple years of sub-field scale variation in experimental N fertilizer applications. To inform farmer decisions that incorporates NUE, we developed a generalizable model to predict subfield scale NUE by comparing six candidate models, using ecological and biogeochemical data gathered from open-source data repositories and from normal farm operations, including yield and protein monitoring data. While NUE varied across fields and years, efficiency was highest in areas of fields with low N availability from both fertilizer and estimated mineralization of soil organic N (SON). At low levels of applied N, distinct responses among fields suggest distinct capacities to supply non-fertilizer plant-available N, suggesting that mineralization supplies more available N in locations with higher total N, reducing efficiency for any applied rate. Comparing modelling approaches, a random forest regression model of NUE provided predictions with the least error relative to observed NUE. Subfield scale predictive models of NUE can help to optimize efficiency in agronomic systems, maximizing both economic net return and NUE, which provides a valuable approach for optimization of nitrogen fertilizer use. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision Making; Nitrogen Use Efficiency; Optimization Modeling; Precision Agriculture; Soil Nitrogen Analysis; Winter Wheat; Decision Making; Fertilizer Application; Nitrogen; Nutrient Use Efficiency; Optimization; Precision Agriculture; Soil Nitrogen; Spatial Variation; Wheat; Montana; United States","decision making; fertilizer application; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency; optimization; precision agriculture; soil nitrogen; spatial variation; wheat; Montana; United States","","","This study was funded by a WSARE Graduate Student Fellowship titled \u201CNitrogen Fertilizer Management Based on Site-Specific Maximized Profit and Minimized Pollution\u201D (Award Number GW19-190); a USDA-NIFA-AFRI Food Security Program Coordinated Agricultural Project, titled \u201CUsing Precision Technology in On-farm Field Trials to Enable Data-Intensive Fertilizer Management\u201D (Accession Number 2016-68004-24769); the USDA-NRCS Conservation Innovation Grant from the On-farm Trials Program, titled \u201CImproving the Economic and Ecological Sustainability of US Crop Production through On-Farm Precision Experimentation\u201D (Award Number NR213A7500013G021); the Montana Fertilizer Advisory Committee from 2016 to 2021; and the Consortium for Research on Environmental Water Systems (CREWS) National Science Foundation EPSCoR Cooperative Agreement OIA-1757351.","Allaire, Maura C., National trends in drinking water quality violations, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 115, 9, pp. 2078-2083, (2018); Andersson, Allan, Nitrogen redistribution from the roots in post-anthesis plants of spring wheat, Plant and Soil, 269, 1-2, pp. 321-332, (2005); Araya, Sofanit, Phenologic metrics derived from MODIS NDVI as indicators for Plant Available Water-holding Capacity, Ecological Indicators, 60, pp. 1263-1272, (2016); Arnall, D.

While agronomic practices have successfully controlled many dicot weeds among narrow-leafed lupins, the closely related sandplain lupin (Lupinus cosentinii) has proven difficult to control, reducing yield and harvest quality. Here, we successfully trained a segmentation model to detect sandplain lupins and differentiate them from narrow-leafed lupins under field conditions. The deep learning model was trained using 9171 images collected from a field site in the Western Australian grain belt. Images were collected using an unoccupied aerial vehicle at heights of 4, 10, and 20 m. The dataset was supplemented with images sourced from the WeedAI database, which were collected at 1.5 m. The resultant model had an average precision of 0.86, intersection over union of 0.60, and F1 score of 0.70 for segmenting the narrow-leafed and sandplain lupins across the multiple datasets. Images collected at a closer range and showing plants at an early developmental stage had significantly higher precision and recall scores (p-value < 0.05), indicating image collection methods and plant developmental stages play a substantial role in the model performance. Nonetheless, the model identified 80.3% of the sandplain lupins on average, with a low variation (±6.13%) in performance across the 5 datasets. The results presented in this study contribute to the development of precision weed management systems within morphologically similar crops, particularly for sandplain lupin detection, supporting future narrow-leafed lupin grain yield and quality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Herbicide Application; Image Segmentation; Lupinus Angustifolius; Lupinus Cosentinii; Narrow-leafed Lupin; Precision Agriculture; Sandplain Lupin; Weed Management; Antennas; Crops; Deep Learning; Grain (agricultural Product); Plants (botany); Precision Agriculture; Quality Control; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Water Quality; Weed Control; Herbicide Application; Images Segmentations; Lupinu Cosentinii; Lupinus Angustifolius; Narrow-leafed Lupinu Angustifoliu; Precision Agriculture; Sandplain Lupinu Angustifoliu; Weed Management; Image Segmentation","Antennas; Crops; Deep learning; Grain (agricultural product); Plants (botany); Precision agriculture; Quality control; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Water quality; Weed control; Herbicide application; Images segmentations; Lupinu cosentinii; Lupinus angustifolius; Narrow-leafed lupinu angustifoliu; Precision Agriculture; Sandplain lupinu angustifoliu; Weed management; Image segmentation","","","The authors would like to thank the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre for computation resources.

The existing CNN-based object detection methods provide feasible strategies for pest detection; however, their low accuracy and speed have restricted the deployment and application in actual agricultural scenarios. In this paper, an improved YOLOv5 model for real-time and effective agricultural pest detection is proposed. First, a lightweight feature extraction network GhostNet is adopted as the backbone, and an efficient channel attention mechanism is introduced to enhance feature extraction. Then, high-resolution feature maps are added to the bidirectional feature pyramid network to enhance the data flow path of the neck, which enriches semantic information and highlights small pests. Furthermore, to assign dynamic weights to features at different receptive fields and highlight the unequal contributions of different receptive fields to global information, feature fusion with attentional multi-receptive fields is proposed.

This will lead to an increase in the cost of seeds and potential yield losses. In this paper, an automatic section control (ASC) system for corn precision planters was proposed to address above problems, the working principle of the system is to build a database of planted areas (DAPA) by collecting coordinates of the planted area during planting, and constantly query whether the coordinates of the seed tube egress point (STC) of each row unit is in DAPA, finally control the start-stop state of the corresponding brushless DC motors (BLDCM) according to the query results. A mathematical model calculating STC of each row unit in real-time according to coordinates acquired by GPS receivers is established. In addition, the system adopts controller area network (CAN) bus distributed control mode, which makes independent control of the row unit possible and offers good extensibility. Algorithms including Geohash algorithm, algorithm of discarding the same prefix, and dynamic trie data structure for improving the efficiency and performance of the ASC systems were proposed. Laboratory experiments were conducted at five Geohash string quantities (7410, 37040, 74070, 111110, and 148,150 Geohash strings), the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms have high efficiency and are basically not affected by the increase of DAPA scale: time consumed (t) of retrieving and inserting a Geohash string from the dynamic trie is less than 36.51 ms and 62.99 ms, respectively, and there is no significant difference in t under various Geohash string quantities (P greater than 0.05). Field experiments were conducted at three positioning frequencies (f<inf>GPS</inf>) (2, 5, and 10 Hz) and three field shape complexity (pa) (0.08, 0.10, and 0.12). The results showed that the dp value could be decreased immensely when the ASC function was turned on: under the ASC function turned off, the corresponding dp values under the pa values of 0.08, 0.1, and 0.12 are 9.17 %, 7.71 %, and 10.74 %, respectively, while once the ASC function is enabled, the dp values under all experiments conditions do not exceed 1.63 %, and the change of pa has no significant effect on the dp. As the f<inf>GPS</inf> increases from 2 Hz to 5 Hz, dp value of field 1–3 decreased significantly by 0.56, 0.39, and 0.52 percentage points, respectively. Due to the influence of processor performance, the fluctuation of dp value is not obvious when f<inf>GPS</inf> increases from 5 Hz to 10 Hz. In conclusion, the proposed ASC system has a good performance in reducing OPA and can be employed on corn precision planters to save seeds and improve yield. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automatic Section Control; Can Bus; Corn Precision Planter; Dynamic Trie; Gps; Brushless Dc Motors; Closed Loop Control Systems; Controllers; Digital Storage; Efficiency; Electric Machine Control; Query Processing; Seed; Automatic Section Control; Complete Coverages; Control Functions; Controller-area-network Bus; Corn Precision Planter; Dynamic Trie; Performances Evaluation; Planted Areas; Plantings; Section Control; Global Positioning System; Control System; Database; Genetic Algorithm; Gps; Maize; Precision; Precision Agriculture; Yield Response","Brushless DC motors; Closed loop control systems; Controllers; Digital storage; Efficiency; Electric machine control; Query processing; Seed; Automatic section control; Complete coverages; Control functions; Controller-area-network bus; Corn precision planter; Dynamic trie; Performances evaluation; Planted areas; Plantings; Section control; Global positioning system; control system; database; genetic algorithm; GPS; maize; precision; precision agriculture; yield response","","","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2021YFD2000404 ).

Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have been widely used to predict crop types according to UAV remote sensing imagery, which has excellent local feature extraction capabilities. However, its receptive field limits the capture of global contextual information. To solve this issue, this study introduced the self-attention-based transformer that obtained long-term feature dependencies of remote sensing imagery as supplementary to local details for accurate crop-type segmentation in UAV remote sensing imagery and proposed an end-to-end CNN–transformer feature-fused network (CTFuseNet). The proposed CTFuseNet first provided a parallel structure of CNN and transformer branches in the encoder to extract both local and global semantic features from the imagery. A new feature-fusion module was designed to flexibly aggregate the multi-scale global and local features from the two branches. Finally, the FPNHead of feature pyramid network served as the decoder for the improved adaptation to the multi-scale fused features and output the crop-type segmentation results. Our comprehensive experiments indicated that the proposed CTFuseNet achieved a higher crop-type-segmentation accuracy, with a mean intersection over union of 85.33% and a pixel accuracy of 92.46% on the benchmark remote sensing dataset and outperformed the state-of-the-art networks, including U-Net, PSPNet, DeepLabV3+, DANet, OCRNet, SETR, and SegFormer. Therefore, the proposed CTFuseNet was beneficial for crop-type segmentation, revealing the advantage of fusing the features found by the CNN and the transformer. Further work is needed to promote accuracy and efficiency of this approach, as well as to assess the model transferability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cnn; Deep Learning; Feature Fusion; Precision Agriculture; Semantic Segmentation; Transformer; Uav Remote Sensing; Antennas; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Deep Learning; Remote Sensing; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Aerial Vehicle; Convolutional Neural Network; Features Fusions; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing Imagery; Remote-sensing; Semantic Segmentation; Transformer; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing; Precision Agriculture","Antennas; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Remote sensing; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Convolutional neural network; Features fusions; Precision Agriculture; Remote sensing imagery; Remote-sensing; Semantic segmentation; Transformer; Unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing; Precision agriculture","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 41901376, and in part by the Open Research Project of The Hubei Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing KLIGIP-2022-B08.","Annual Report, (2017); Yi, Zhiwei, Crop classification using multi-temporal sentinel-2 data in the Shiyang river basin of China, Remote Sensing, 12, 24, pp. 1-21, (2020); Mulla, David J., Twenty five years of remote sensing in precision agriculture: Key advances and remaining knowledge gaps, Biosystems Engineering, 114, 4, pp. 358-371, (2013); Liu, Jia, Boost precision agriculture with unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing and edge intelligence: A survey, Remote Sensing, 13, 21, (2021); Valente, João, DETECTING RUMEX OBTUSIFOLIUS WEED PLANTS in GRASSLANDS from UAV RGB IMAGERY USING DEEP LEARNING, ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 4, 2/W5, pp. 179-185, (2019); Furuya, Danielle Elis Garcia, Prediction of insect-herbivory-damage and insect-type attack in maize plants using hyperspectral data, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 105, (2021); Abdulridha, Jaafar J., UAV-based remote sensing technique to detect citrus canker disease utilizing hyperspectral imaging and machine learning, Remote Sensing, 11, 11, (2019); Apolo-Apolo, Orly Enrique, Deep learning techniques for estimation of the yield and size of citrus fruits using a UAV, European Journal of Agronomy, 115, (2020); Feng, Siwen, Crop Type Identification and Mapping Using Machine Learning Algorithms and Sentinel-2 Time Series Data, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 12, 9, pp. 3295-3306, (2019); Useya, Juliana, Comparative Performance Evaluation of Pixel-Level and Decision-Level Data Fusion of Landsat 8 OLI, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Sentinel-2 MSI for Crop Ensemble Classification, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 11, 11, pp. 4441-4451, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","20724292","9780891814184; 0891814183; 9780123694072","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149229390"

This paper explores the use of Machine Learning (ML) in crop selection and cultivation to address these challenges. Traditional methods are often inadequate given the increasing population and shifting climate patterns. Machine Learning, with its data-driven and predictive approach, has the potential to revolutionize crop management. The study investigates various ML algorithms like neural networks, decision trees, and ensemble models to analyze datasets covering factors such as soil quality, climate conditions, and historical crop performance. By using these algorithms, the goal is to optimize crop selection for specific regions, leading to higher yields and reduced environmental impact. The paper also explores real-time data acquisition methods like IoT sensors and satellite imagery to gain a comprehensive understanding of agricultural landscapes. Furthermore, the paper discusses how ML algorithms can be used in precision agriculture, enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. By analyzing extensive datasets, these algorithms can predict the best cultivation practices, reducing resource wastage and improving efficiency. The integration of Machine Learning not only provides a data-driven approach to crop selection but also promotes sustainable agriculture, contributing to food security and environmental conservation. This research encourages the adoption of Machine Learning in agriculture, highlighting its transformative potential in global food production systems.

Due to a broad range of rice varieties, each of which has specific properties and characteristics, accurate categorization of rice variations is essential for agricultural practices, commerce, and culinary uses. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an excellent option for tackling the difficulties of rice variety categorization since they have become a potent deep-learning technique. A CNN model for the precise and efficient categorization of rice types is presented in this study. An extensive set of 75,000 images from five different types of rice (Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag) was assembled for model training and assessment. To facilitate unbiased performance measurement, the dataset was partitioned at random into a training batch of 60,000 images and a test batch of 15,000 images. CNNs can learn hierarchical representations of visual input, allowing them to recognize complex patterns and connections within images, making them ideally suited for computer vision applications, notably image classification. This skill is essential for classifying rice varieties since it allows for detecting minute variations across rice kinds. The research's findings are encouraging because the proposed CNN model had a remarkable accuracy on the test set of 97.31%. This high degree of precision supports the model's outstanding capacity to distinguish between the five annotated classes of rice varieties, demonstrating the promise of deep learning methods in solving complex agricultural problems. The efficacy of this CNN-based strategy will significantly impact the agriculture industry. Accurate rice variety identification gives farmers the flexibility to modify growing techniques per particular needs while maintaining the purity and legitimacy of the final product for the food business. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cnn; Image Classification; Precision Agriculture; Rice Varieties; Sustainable Food Production; Complex Networks; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Food Supply; Learning Systems; Neural Network Models; Precision Agriculture; Statistical Tests; Convolutional Neural Network; Food Production; Food Security; Images Classification; Network-based Approach; Neural Network Model; Precision Agriculture; Rice Variety; Staple Crops; Sustainable Food Production; Image Classification","Complex networks; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Food supply; Learning systems; Neural network models; Precision agriculture; Statistical tests; Convolutional neural network; Food production; Food security; Images classification; Network-based approach; Neural network model; Precision Agriculture; Rice variety; Staple crops; Sustainable food production; Image classification","","","","Almansour, Saleh Hamad Sajaan, A Convolution Neural Network Design for Knee Osteoarthritis Diagnosis Using X-ray Images, International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering, 19, 7, pp. 125-141, (2023); Anand, Vatsala, Fusion of U-Net and CNN model for segmentation and classification of skin lesion from dermoscopy images, Expert Systems with Applications, 213, (2023); Shandilya, Gunjan, Extraction of Facial Features using an Efficient Convolution Siamese Network on Customized Dataset, pp. 503-508, (2023); Anand, Vatsala, An Enhanced Transfer Learning Based Classification for Diagnosis of Skin Cancer, Diagnostics, 12, 7, (2022); Pogil Activity Clearinghouse, (2022); Sharma, Neha, Siamese Convolutional Neural Network-Based Twin Structure Model for Independent Offline Signature Verification, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 18, (2022); Ruslan, Rashidah, Weedy Rice Classification Using Image Processing and a Machine Learning Approach, Agriculture (Switzerland), 12, 5, (2022); Tasci, Mustafa, An Efficient Classification of Rice Variety with Quantized Neural Networks, Electronics (Switzerland), 12, 10, (2023); Weng, Shizhuang, Hyperspectral imaging for accurate determination of rice variety using a deep learning network with multi-feature fusion, Spectrochimica Acta - Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy, 234, (2020); Koklu, Murat, Classification of rice varieties with deep learning methods, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 187, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE","2nd IEEE International Conference on Futuristic Technologies, INCOFT 2023","","Belagavi, Karnataka; SSET�s S.

Using a novel combination of Federated Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), this study sets out on a cutting-edge quest to assess the subtle severity levels of strawberry leaf illnesses. The research explores four well-defined severity levels using datasets from six clients, each capturing various aspects of the disease's course. While CNN design is optimized to identify even the most delicate morphological signs of the illness, the decentralized nature of Federated Learning guarantees data privacy. The resulting Federated Averaging CNN model displays excellent performance metrics. Macro averages range from 78.64% for the hardest client datasets to 92.04% for the pickiest ones. Weighted averages range from 78.89% to 92.02%, whereas micro standards, which vary from 78.90% to 92.01%, demonstrate a comparable level of performance. The model's clever ability to categorize the severity of strawberry leaf ailments is shown by these measures alone and together. This study represents a breakthrough in plant disease identification by bringing a practical, scalable, and effective solution to strawberry growers worldwide while simultaneously breaking new ground in machine learning and agronomy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cnn; Diseases Bifurcations; Distributed Learning; Severity Analysis; Strawberry Leaves; Convolutional Neural Networks; Data Privacy; Fruits; Plants (botany); Convolutional Neural Network; Cutting Edges; Disease Bifurcation; Disease Severity; Distributed Learning; Learning Neural Networks; Plant Disease; Precision Agriculture; Severity Analysis; Strawberry Leaf; Diseases","Convolutional neural networks; Data privacy; Fruits; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Cutting edges; Disease bifurcation; Disease severity; Distributed learning; Learning neural networks; Plant disease; Precision Agriculture; Severity analysis; Strawberry leaf; Diseases","","","","Aggarwal, Meenakshi, Lightweight Federated Learning for Rice Leaf Disease Classification Using Non Independent and Identically Distributed Images, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 16, (2023); Mehta, Shiva, Spinach Leaf Disease Detection and Severity Analysis: Breaking New Ground with Federated Learning and CNN, (2023); Tran, Nguyen H., Federated Learning over Wireless Networks: Optimization Model Design and Analysis, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 2019-April, pp. 1387-1395, (2019); Mehta, Shiva, Exploring the Potential of Convolutional Neural Networks in Automatic Diagnosis of Dragon Fruit Diseases from Plant Photographs, pp. 536-540, (2023); Mantri, Archana, Design and evaluation of a PBL-based course in analog electronics, IEEE Transactions on Education, 51, 4, pp. 432-438, (2008); Arora, Gurpreet, Formulation and evaluation of controlled release matrix mucoadhesive tablets of domperidone using Salvia plebeian gum, Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology and Research, 2, 3, pp. 163-169, (2011); Mehta, Shiva, Advanced Mango Leaf Disease Detection and Severity Analysis with Federated Learning and CNN, (2023); Kukreja, Vinay, Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS approaches to prioritize teaching solutions for Intellect Errors, Journal of Engineering Education Transformations, 35, 4, pp. 50-58, (2022); Mehta, Shiva, Revolutionizing Maize Disease Management with Federated Learning CNNs: A Decentralized and Privacy-Sensitive Approach, (2023); Kukreja, Vinay, Deep learning in Human Gait Recognition: An Overview, pp. 9-13, (2021)","Dwivedi, R.K.; Saxena, A.Kr.; Sharma, R.; Bhardwaj, S.; Khattri, V.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Teerthanker Mahaveer University","12th International Conference on System Modeling and Advancement in Research Trends, SMART 2023","","Moradabad","197420","","9798350369861","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186749034"

This study follows the footsteps of machine learning experts by introducing the state-of-the-art Yolov8 technology into the field of plant science. Moreover, we made some simple yet effective improvements. The integration of shallow-level information into the Path Aggregation Network (PANet) served to counterbalance the resolution loss stemming from the expanded receptive field. The enhancement of upsampled features was accomplished through combining the lightweight up-sampling operator Content-Aware ReAssembly of Features (CARAFE) with the Multi-Efficient Channel Attention (Mlt-ECA) technique to optimize the precision of upsampled features. This collective approach markedly amplified the discernment of small objects in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images, naming it Yolov8-UAV. Our evaluation is based on datasets containing four different plant species. Experimental results demonstrate the strong competitiveness of our proposed method even when compared to the most advanced counting techniques, and it possesses sufficient robustness. In order to advance the cross-disciplinary research of computer vision and plant science, we also release a new cotton boll dataset with detailed annotated bounding box information. What's more, we address previous oversights in existing wheat ear datasets by providing updated labels consistent with global research advancements. Overall, this research offers practitioners a powerful solution for addressing real-world application challenges. For UAV scenarios, recommend using the specialized Yolov8-UAV, while Yolov8-N is a wise choice for general scenes due to its sufficient accuracy and speed in the majority of cases. Furthermore, we contribute two meaningful datasets that have research significance, effectively promoting the application of data resources in the field of plant science. In short, our contribution is to improve the use of Yolov8 in UAV scenarios and open two datasets with bounding boxes.

Rapid diagnosis and accurate identification of these disorders are critical for effective disease control and prevention. In this research, we offer an extensive evaluation and contrast of three state -of-art CNN models- VGG19, DenseNet121 and ResNet50-in order to identify and forecast potato leaf diseases. Our study employed a sizable dataset of potato leaf images, containing diverse healthy and afflicted specimens, to train and assess the performance of the chosen CNN models. Extensive data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the dataset’s diversity and generalization capabilities. We evaluated the models considering their accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and computational efficiency to determine the most fitting model for real-life applications. The results demonstrate that all three CNN models achieved high performance in identifying and predicting potato leaf diseases, with VGG19 emerging as the top performer followed closely by DenseNet121 and ResNet50.Our findings provide valuable insights into the efficacy of DL approaches for potato leaf ailment identification and offer a foundation for future research and deployment of these models in precision agriculture systems.

They may severely damage crop yield, leading to detrimental effects on global food security. The timely and precise detection of leaf diseases is thus crucial for preventing their spread and ensuring the sustainability of agricultural production. In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based leaf disease detection model, namely FormerLeaf along with two optimization methods to enhance the model performance. In more detail, we propose the Least Important Attention Pruning (LeIAP) algorithm to select the most important attention heads of each layer in the Transformer model. It could reduce the model size up to 28% and accelerate the evaluation speed by 15% with about 3% accuracy enhancement. In addition, we employ the sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) to calculate matrix correlation in the model. This reduces the model's complexity from O(n2) to [Formula presented], resulting in lowering training time by 10% while keeping a similar performance. The evaluation results on the Cassava Leaf Disease Dataset show that our proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art models in most cases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Efficient Vision Transformer; Image Classification; Leaf Disease Detection; Precision Agriculture; Deep Learning; Food Supply; Global Warming; Matrix Algebra; Plants (botany); Precision Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Crop Yield; Efficient Vision Transformer; Global Food Security; Images Classification; Leaf Disease; Leaf Disease Detections; Outdoor Air; Precision Agriculture; Image Classification; Accuracy Assessment; Algorithm; Complexity; Correlation; Global Warming; Image Classification; Machine Learning; Optimization; Precision Agriculture; Sustainability; Training","Deep learning; Food supply; Global warming; Matrix algebra; Plants (botany); Precision agriculture; Air pollutants; Crop yield; Efficient vision transformer; Global food security; Images classification; Leaf disease; Leaf disease detections; Outdoor air; Precision Agriculture; Image classification; accuracy assessment; algorithm; complexity; correlation; global warming; image classification; machine learning; optimization; precision agriculture; sustainability; training","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the VNUHCM-University of Information Technology's Scientific Research Support Fund.; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the VNUHCM-University of Information Technology’s Scientific Research Support Fund .","Abbas, Amreen, Tomato plant disease detection using transfer learning with C-GAN synthetic images, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 187, (2021); Agrawal, Nitesh, Grape leaf disease detection and classification using multi-class support vector machine, 2018-January, pp. 238-244, (2018); El-Nouby, Alaaeldin, XCiT: Cross-Covariance Image Transformers, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 24, pp. 20014-20027, (2021); Datenbanksysteme Fur Business Technologie Und Web Btw 2017 Workshopband, (2017); Indiakisan Net Expert Advisory System, (2007); Employment in Agriculture of Total Employment Modeled Ilo Estimate, (2021); Barbedo, Jayme G.A., A review on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles and imaging sensors for monitoring and assessing plant stresses, Drones, 3, 2, pp. 1-27, (2019); Bi, Chongke, MobileNet Based Apple Leaf Diseases Identification, Mobile Networks and Applications, 27, 1, pp. 172-180, (2022); Regionvit Regional to Local Attention for Vision Transformers, (2021); Generating Long Sequences with Sparse Transformers, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01681699","","CEAGE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145564178"

The definition of ADSS is usually broad enough to include any computer based system for collating, analysing and displaying data in a way that supports farm decision making (Zhai et al., 2020; Talari et al., 2021). However, advances in remote sensing and information technology mean that effective modern ADSS are expected to support dynamic data (e.g. \u2018real-time\u2019 data on climate or crop condition), the ability to interactively explore alternative management options via \u201Cwhat-if\u201D modelling, and intuitive, multi-scale graphical user interfaces, often supported by open webGIS (Terribile et al., 2015). A key development that has driven the development of many recent ADSS is the uptake of \u2018precision agriculture\u2019. Precision agriculture implies the use of technology to collect and supply data on spatial and temporal variability in agricultural production, on which to base agricultural management decisions (Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-Deboer, 2004; McBratney et al., 2005). The fine spatial and temporal resolution of precision agriculture data enables targeting and application of management at the sub-field scale. However, this creates very large volumes of data that must be presented in a way that farmers can access and interpret to inform management decisions (Rose et al., 2018b), hence the need for ADSS.The development of this tool was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under research programme NE/N018125/1 ASSIST \u2013 Achieving Sustainable Agricultural Systems www.assist.ceh.ac.uk.

Therefore, weed control with minimal environmental damage is a global concern. Traditional weed control methods are not cost-effective. Hence, precision agriculture proposes variable flow herbicide technology through regional weed management to distinguish weed and crop. In the present study, we employed the U-Net architecture, as a deep encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) for pixel-wise semantic segmentation of sugar beet, weed, and soil. We trained the U-Net architecture with ResNet50 as the encoder block using 1385 RGB images collected under different conditions and various heights. We utilized the combination of the dice and focal losses as a custom linear loss function to overcome imbalanced data and small area segmentation challenges. The structure of the dataset for the training process and using the custom loss function led to a model with the accuracy and intersection over union (IoU) score of 0.9606 and 0.8423, respectively. The results showed that using the image dataset with proper distribution and custom loss function can improve segmentation accuracy, especially in small regions. Furthermore, in an autonomous weed control robot, CNN-based automatic weed detection can be integrated into selective herbicide applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Semantic Segmentation; Sugar Beet; Weed Detection; Convolutional Neural Networks; Cost Effectiveness; Crops; Deep Learning; Herbicides; Image Enhancement; Network Architecture; Precision Agriculture; Semantics; Signal Encoding; Sugar Beets; Weed Control; Convolutional Neural Network; Loss Functions; Major Factors; Net Architecture; Precision Agriculture; Semantic Segmentation; Sugar Beet Fields; Weed Detection; Weed Recognition; Semantic Segmentation","Convolutional neural networks; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Deep learning; Herbicides; Image enhancement; Network architecture; Precision agriculture; Semantics; Signal encoding; Sugar beets; Weed control; Convolutional neural network; Loss functions; Major factors; NET architecture; Precision Agriculture; Semantic segmentation; Sugar beet fields; Weed detection; Weed recognition; Semantic Segmentation","","","The authors would like to thank University of Tehran (Iran) for their financial supports and contributions to this study.","Int J Eng Trends Technol, (2017); Agricultural Reviews, (2015); Tohidyan Far, Somayeh, Impacts of the precision agricultural technologies in Iran: An analysis experts’ perception & their determinants, Information Processing in Agriculture, 5, 1, pp. 173-184, (2018); Asad, Muhammad Hamza, Weed detection in canola fields using maximum likelihood classification and deep convolutional neural network, Information Processing in Agriculture, 7, 4, pp. 535-545, (2020); Berge, Therese With, Towards machine vision based site-specific weed management in cereals, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 81, pp. 79-86, (2012); Wang, Aichen, Semantic Segmentation of Crop and Weed using an Encoder-Decoder Network and Image Enhancement Method under Uncontrolled Outdoor Illumination, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 81724-81734, (2020); Taghadomi-Saberi, Saeedeh, Improving field management by machine vision – A review, Agricultural Engineering International: CIGR Journal, 17, 3, pp. 92-111, (2015); Wang, Aichen, A review on weed detection using ground-based machine vision and image processing techniques, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 158, pp. 226-240, (2019); López-Granados, F., Weed detection for site-specific weed management: Mapping and real-time approaches, Weed Research, 51, 1, pp. 1-11, (2011); Romeo, Juan, A new Expert System for greenness identification in agricultural images, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, 6, pp. 2275-2286, (2013)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","22105379","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131099205"

In total, 151 studies were identified and categorised. Seventy-six percent of N recommendation systems are empirical and based on spatialised vegetation indices (73% of them); 21% are based on mechanistic crop simulation models with limited use of spatialized data (26% of them); 3% are based on machine learning techniques with the integration of spatialised and non-spatialised data. Recommendation systems appeared worldwide in 2000; they were often applied in the exact location where calibration had been carried out. Thirty percent of the studies use advanced recommendation techniques, such as sensor/approach fusion (44%), algorithm add-ons (30%), estimation of environmental benefits (13%), and omme multi-objective decisions (13%). However, some limitations have been identified. For example, empirical systems need specific calibrations for each site, species, and sensor, rarely using soil, veg-etation, and weather data together, while mechanistic systems need large input data sets, often non-spatialised. We conclude that N recommendation systems can be improved by better data and the integration of algorithms. l use only. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Fusion; Empirical Models; Fertilisation; Fertiliser Amount; Mechanistic Models; Sensors; Algorithm; Calibration; Fertilization (reproduction); Machine Learning; Precision Agriculture; Vegetation","algorithm; calibration; fertilization (reproduction); machine learning; precision agriculture; vegetation","","","","Adamchuk, Viacheslav I., Theoretical basis for sensor-based in-season nitrogen management, pp. 403-410, (2013); Advances in Animal Biosciences, (2017); Argento, Francesco, Site-specific nitrogen management in winter wheat supported by low-altitude remote sensing and soil data, Precision Agriculture, 22, 2, pp. 364-386, (2021); Arnall, D.

Almost 70 percent of the Indian population is directly or indirectly related to agriculture. The practice of conventional agriculture nowadays has become inefficient due to various factors such as climate change and global warming. Climate change has negatively affected the crop production cycle and hence reduced crop yield. But the advancement in other technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning has proved wonders in other sectors and inculcating such techniques in farming is also a great step. To anticipate agricultural yield, statistical models are typically used, which takes time and is laborious. A significant development in the field is the rise of deep learning and machine learning trends.

It is crucial in making decisions at global, regional, and field levels. Numerous factors such as genotype, environment, and their interactions decide a mosaic trait such as crop yield prediction. Faultless yield prediction demands elementary understanding of the relationship between yield and the associated factors. Comprehensive datasets and powerful algorithms are required to reveal the connection between the associated factors. Machine learning is an indispensable tool for crop yield prediction, which helps in making decisions with regard to the type of crops to be grown during the season and what to be done during the growing season of crops. An accurate crop prediction model helps farmers in deciding the financial investment and forecast the returns on the investment. The proposed solution aims to create a heaped model consisting of linear models. In order to achieve the solution, data from the period of 1995-2010 were collected, coming from official varietal experiments carried out in India. The solution consists of a random forest regressor, decision tree regressor, KNN regressor and XGB regressor. For validation of the model, four forecast error metrics were used: i.e., mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), R2-SCORE and Accuracy. As a result of the conducted experiments, the models individually provided an accuracy ranging from 63% to 85% and the stacked model provided an accuracy of 94%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Bagging; Boosting; Crop Yield Prediction; Hybrid Model; Hybrid Model; Machine Learning; Adaptive Boosting; Decision Trees; Errors; Forecasting; Machine Learning; Mean Square Error; Precision Agriculture; Bagging; Boosting; Crop Yield; Crop Yield Prediction; Hybrid Model; Machine-learning; Making Decision; Precision Agriculture; Yield Prediction; Crops","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Errors; Forecasting; Machine learning; Mean square error; Precision agriculture; Bagging; Boosting; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Hybrid model; Machine-learning; Making decision; Precision Agriculture; Yield prediction; Crops","","","","Technology, (2020); Elavarasan, Dhivya, A reinforced random forest model for enhanced crop yield prediction by integrating agrarian parameters, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 12, 11, pp. 10009-10022, (2021); Guruprasad, Ranjini B., Machine learning methodologies for paddy yield estimation in India: A case study, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2019-January, pp. 7254-7257, (2019); Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research, (2020); Problems of Poverty and Motivation of Workers to Labour in the Field of Agriculture as Effects of Stagnant Economy, (2018); Crop Yield Prediction Using Different Machine Learning Techniques, (2021); Mupangwa, Walter T., Evaluating machine learning algorithms for predicting maize yield under conservation agriculture in Eastern and Southern Africa, SN Applied Sciences, 2, 5, (2020); Nichols, James A., Machine learning: applications of artificial intelligence to imaging and diagnosis, Biophysical Reviews, 11, 1, pp. 111-118, (2019); Location Based Crop Prediction Using Data Mining and Machine Learning, (2020); Crop Yield Fore Casting Using Machine Learning, (2022)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Networks and Wireless Communications, ICMNWC 2022","","Virtual, Online; IEEE STB Sri Siddhartha Institute of Technology","186590","","9781665491112","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148302675"

This paper investigates the use of multi-task learning methods to delineate agricultural fields from very high-resolution satellite images. In this study, we introduce a new boundary-aware multi-task neural network, i.e., BDA-Net, and combined with an edge detection model Richer Convolutional Features (RCF) for agricultural fields delineation. More specifically, BDA-Net learns three tasks, a core task for mask prediction, two auxiliary tasks are boundary prediction and distance maps estimation. The auxiliary tasks are contributing to capturing the boundary and shape of the fields to produce a smooth mask. We conducted experiments on two different areas in the Yongxing town and Shuibei Jie town of Fujian province, China. We acquired two GF-2 PMS satellite images with 0.8m spatial resolution for the Shuibei Jie and Yongxing areas. We compared BDA-Net with the existing UNet and evaluated the obtained results in terms of object-based evaluation measures. Our results show that BDA-Net has the lowest global total error (0.302) compared with UNet for the Yongxing datasets and it can also apply to the Shuibei Jie area. Moreover, BDA-Net obtained closed fields boundary in one segmentation and thus avoiding post-processing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Fields Delineation; Bda-net; Multi-task Learning; Rcf; Very High-resolution Satellite Images; Agriculture; Computer Vision; Satellites; Agricultural Field Delineation; Agricultural Fields; Bda-net; Multi Tasks; Multitask Learning; Neural-networks; Precision Agriculture; Rich Convolutional Feature; Spatial Informations; Very High Resolution Satellite Images; Learning Systems","Agriculture; Computer vision; Satellites; Agricultural field delineation; Agricultural fields; BDA-net; Multi tasks; Multitask learning; Neural-networks; Precision Agriculture; Rich convolutional feature; Spatial informations; Very high resolution satellite images; Learning systems","","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) with Grant No. 42001283, and the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China, with Grant No. 2021J01630.","Debats, Stephanie R., A generalized computer vision approach to mapping crop fields in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes, Remote Sensing of Environment, 179, pp. 210-221, (2016); Matton, Nicolas, An automated method for annual cropland mapping along the season for various globally-distributed agrosystems using high spatial and temporal resolution time series, Remote Sensing, 7, 10, pp. 13208-13232, (2015); García-Pedrero, Ángel M., A machine learning approach for agricultural parcel delineation through agglomerative segmentation, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 38, 7, pp. 1809-1819, (2017); Graesser, Jordan, Detection of cropland field parcels from Landsat imagery, Remote Sensing of Environment, 201, pp. 165-180, (2017); Belgiu, Mariana, Sentinel-2 cropland mapping using pixel-based and object-based time-weighted dynamic time warping analysis, Remote Sensing of Environment, 204, pp. 509-523, (2018); Evans, Carolyn J., Segmenting multispectral landsat TM images into field units, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 40, 5, pp. 1054-1064, (2002); Martin, David R., Learning to detect natural image boundaries using local brightness, color, and texture cues, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 26, 5, pp. 530-549, (2004); Ronneberger, Olaf, U-net: Convolutional networks for biomedical image segmentation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9351, pp. 234-241, (2015); Persello, Claudio, Delineation of agricultural fields in smallholder farms from satellite images using fully convolutional networks and combinatorial grouping, Remote Sensing of Environment, 231, (2019); Taravat, Alireza, Advanced fully convolutional networks for agricultural field boundary detection, Remote Sensing, 13, 4, pp. 1-12, (2021)","Hu, S.; Ye, X.; Lin, H.; Gao, S.; Zheng, X.; Zhang, C.","IEEE Computer Society","","29th International Conference on Geoinformatics, Geoinformatics 2022","","Beijing","184844","21610258; 2161024X","9781538622667; 9798350344240; 9781467362283; 9798350309881; 9781467376631; 9781538676196; 9781509062140","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143889574"

An SM estimation model is developed using a random forest (RF) machine-learning (ML) algorithm by combining features obtained from reflected GPS signals (collected by smartphones and commercial off-the-shelf receivers) in conjunction with ancillary vegetation indices from the multispectral camera data. The proposed ML algorithm uses in situ SM measurements acquired via SM probes as labels. A preliminary field experiment was conducted on 210 by 110 m (2.31 ha) crop fields (corn and cotton) in 2020 (from January to November, including crop planting through senescence time period) at Mississippi State University (MSU)'s the heavily instrumented North Farm to acquire data needed for the ML model to train and test. Our results showed that both fields could be covered by GPS reflectometry measurements with about 13 min of flight time at a 15-m altitude, and SM can be mapped with 5 × 5 m spatial resolution (corresponding to the elongated first Fresnel zone). The model is trained with and validated against eight in situ SM station datasets via tenfold and leave-one-probe-out cross-validation techniques. Overall, root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.013 m 3 m-3 volumetric SM and R-value of 0.95 [-] are obtained for tenfold cross validation. The proposed model reached an RMSE of 0.033 m3 m-3 and an R-value of 0.5 [-] in leave-one-probe-out cross validation. While having limited data, the results indicate that high-resolution SM measurement can be achieved with a low-cost GPS reflectometry system onboard a small UAS platform for use in precision agriculture applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (cygnss); Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (gnss-r); Precision Agriculture (pa); Reflectometry; Soil Moisture (sm); Unmanned Aircraft System (uas); Agricultural Technology; Bayesian Networks; Cameras; Crops; Decision Trees; Estimation; Fighter Aircraft; Image Resolution; Learning Systems; Mean Square Error; Precision Agriculture; Probes; Reflection; Reflectometers; Remote Sensing; Soil Moisture; Soil Surveys; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Vegetation Mapping; Cygnss; Gnss-r; Land Surface; Precision Agriculture; Reflectometry; Remote-sensing; Sea Measurements; Small Unmanned Aircrafts; Unmanned Aircraft System; Global Positioning System; Crop; Gnss; Gps; Imagery; Multispectral Image; Precision Agriculture; Reflectometry; Soil Moisture; Unmanned Vehicle","Agricultural technology; Bayesian networks; Cameras; Crops; Decision trees; Estimation; Fighter aircraft; Image resolution; Learning systems; Mean square error; Precision agriculture; Probes; Reflection; Reflectometers; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation mapping; CYGNSS; GNSS-R; Land surface; Precision Agriculture; Reflectometry; Remote-sensing; Sea measurements; Small unmanned aircrafts; Unmanned aircraft system; Global positioning system; crop; GNSS; GPS; imagery; multispectral image; precision agriculture; reflectometry; soil moisture; unmanned vehicle","","","This work was supported in part by USDA-ARS under Award NACA 58-6064-9-007 and in part by National Science Foundation under Grant 2142218.","Susha Lekshmi, S.

Agriculture provides a means of subsistence for a huge proportion of the global population. It also provides a large number of work opportunities for the locals. Poor yields are a consequence of farmers' desire to rely on old-fashioned farming methods. The long-term development and success of the economy will continue to depend on agricultural and related industries. Crop monitoring and tracking, disease identification and management, and other such issues are among agriculture's most difficult difficulties. In many cases, smart farming is a viable answer. The internet of things and machine learning methods has made it feasible to implement smart agriculture. This article presents a framework for real-time picture categorization in agriculture. Everything from IoT cameras to mobile applications to machine learning methods is featured. Arduino Uno, sensors, and Wi-Fi devices make up the hardware. Computers may ""learn"" from previous examples and detect patterns from noisy or complicated data sets using Machine learning, a technique that uses a variety of statistical, probabilistic, and optimization methodologies to allow computers to ""learn."" Because of this, machine learning algorithms are increasingly being utilized to classify photos. Real-time photos linked to smart agriculture were classified using a combination of SVM, K-nearest neighbors, and probabilistic neural network classifiers. Real-time picture classification will assist in the diagnosis of leaf disease, the monitoring of farm staff, the classification of crops, and the tracking of farm product progress. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Internet Of Things; Machine Learning; Precision Agriculture; Real Time Image Classification; Smart Agriculture; Computer Aided Diagnosis; Crops; Internet Of Things; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Nearest Neighbor Search; Neural Networks; Precision Agriculture; Support Vector Machines; Images Classification; Learn+; Machine Learning Methods; Machine-learning; Precision Agriculture; Real Time Image Classification; Real Time Images; Real Time Pictures; Real-time Images; Smart Agricultures; Image Classification","Computer aided diagnosis; Crops; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Precision agriculture; Support vector machines; Images classification; Learn+; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Precision Agriculture; Real time image classification; Real time images; Real time pictures; Real-time images; Smart agricultures; Image classification","","","","Barrow Books, (2018); Giechaskiel, Ilias, When the crypto in cryptocurrencies breaks: Bitcoin security under broken primitives, IEEE Security and Privacy, 16, 4, pp. 46-56, (2018); Liang, Wei, Secure Data Storage and Recovery in Industrial Blockchain Network Environments, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 16, 10, pp. 6543-6552, (2020); Zhao, Bo, Y-DWMS: A digital watermark management system based on smart contracts, Sensors, 19, 14, (2019); Patil, Ganesh Gopalrao, Techniques of Deep Learning for Image Recognition, (2019); Khan, Rimsha, Evaluating machine learning techniques on human activity recognition using accelerometer data, (2020); Sharma, Abhinav, Machine Learning Applications for Precision Agriculture: A Comprehensive Review, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 4843-4873, (2021); Nandhini, S., Performance Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Email Spam Detection, (2020); Suneera, C.

Global warming and the adoption of conventional farming practices have adversely affected the overall habitat of the plants. Lack of knowledge regarding what a single plant species can serve makes them more prone to get worse affected due to adverse human activities. Plants have been used for curing the most deadly diseases and to make medicines from them. There are still a huge number of plant species yet to be discovered. With the introduction of technology in the field of agriculture such as the Internet of Things and Precision Agriculture, there lies a huge possibility of providing solutions to major issues such as those arising out of the conventional farming practices, plant pathological issues. To support and serve this cause, we have made a database of some of the plants that grow in the Kashmir region of the Jammu and Kashmir, Union Territory (UT) of India. While Kashmir is having a moderate climate, Jammu is a nearby subtropical region with a hot climate, whereas Ladakh, on the other hand, has a cold desert-like environment. In this work, a database of eight different plants namely: Apple, Walnut, Cherry, Grapes, Peach, Pear, Cranberry, and Apricot have been created. These plants have both commercial and medicinal usage and can be a major asset for the development of precision agriculture frameworks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Image Recognition; Machine Learning; Plant Disease Detection; Plant Pathology; Precision Agriculture; Database Systems; Fruits; Global Warming; Machine Learning; Precision Agriculture; Disease Detection; Farming Practices; Jammu And Kashmir; Leaf Database; Native Plants; Plant Disease; Plant Disease Detection; Plant Pathology; Plant Species; Precision Agriculture; Image Recognition","Database systems; Fruits; Global warming; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Disease detection; Farming practices; Jammu and Kashmir; Leaf database; Native plants; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; Plant pathology; Plant species; Precision Agriculture; Image recognition","","","","Heywood, Vernon Hilton, Plant conservation in the Anthropocene – Challenges and future prospects, Plant Diversity, 39, 6, pp. 314-330, (2017); Liu, Udayangani, A multicriteria decision making approach to prioritise vascular plants for species-based conservation, Biological Conservation, 234, pp. 221-240, (2019); Chemeris, Elena V., The conservation of aquatic vascular plants in Asian Russia, Aquatic Botany, 157, pp. 42-54, (2019); Volis, Sergei, Securing a future for China's plant biodiversity through an integrated conservation approach, Plant Diversity, 40, 3, pp. 91-105, (2018); Ecol Indic, (2018); Stokes, Alexia, Desirable Plant root traits for protecting natural and engineered slopes against landslides, Plant and Soil, 324, 1, pp. 1-30, (2009); Min, Xiaobo, Study on the Ecological Farming Control System Based on the Internet of Things, Wireless Personal Communications, 102, 4, pp. 2955-2967, (2018); Ubudi, Rihla, Automation system for controlling and monitoring ornamental plants using fuzzy logic method, 2017-January, pp. 196-201, (2017); Kapoor, Ayush, Implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) and Image processing in smart agriculture, pp. 21-26, (2016); Yimwadsana, Boonsit, An IoT controlled system for plant growth, (2018)","Singh, P.K.; Singh, Y.; Kolekar, M.H.; Kar, A.K.; Gonçalves, P.J.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","4th International Conference on Recent Innovations in Computing, ICRIC 2021","","Jammu","274749","18761119; 18761100","9789819680023; 9789819658473; 9789819600571; 9789819644292; 9789819637577; 9783319030135; 9783642363283; 9789819648115; 9783642384653; 9789819920914","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127019068"

As a result, remote sensing (RS) can be seen as an innovation for the fast generation of reliable information for agricultural management. Near real-time processed RS data can be used as a tool for decision making on multiple scales, from subplot to the global level. This high potential is not yet fully applied, due to often limited access to ground truth information, which is crucial for the development of transferable applications and acceptance. In this study we present a digital workflow for the acquisition, processing and dissemination of agroecological information based on proprietary and open-source software tools with state-of-the-art web-mapping technologies. Data is processed in near real-time and thus can be used as ground truth information to enhance quality and performance of RS-based products. Data is disseminated by easy-to-understand visualizations and download functionalities for specific application levels to serve specific user needs. It thus can increase expert knowledge and can be used for decision support at the same time. The fully digital workflow underpins the great potential to facilitate quality enhancement of future RS products in the context of precision agriculture by safeguarding data quality.

High accuracy and execution speed of navigation tasks are needed for the escalating field machine implementations in a significantly unstructured and irregular field environment, contributing to the difficulty and urgency of achieving a field navigation solution with high navigation accuracy while maintaining proper execution speed. In our study, the row anchor selection classification method (RASCM) is presented to track early-stage crop rows, and the early corn seedling dataset (E-dataset) and LRC-dataset are developed for the measurement of the experimental results. RASCM is divided into three parts, including a row anchor selection method (RasM), a lightweight deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) network GhostNet, and a combined loss function (C-loss). It is suggested that RASCM has achieved good results in terms of calculation speed and accuracy by comparing the end-to-end regression operation based on the steering wheel angle (E2Er) and crop row pixel segmentation (SeG) approaches with RASCM on the LRC-dataset, which can be effectively applied in actual projects. Finally, a class activation map (CAM) is used to visualize the internal working mechanism of GhostNet, and the demonstrated effectiveness of GhostNet is not limited to the RasM labeling area. In contrast, broad global features are learned, and the previous noise is highly mitigated. Strong generalization performance for different environments is displayed by using RACSM, contributing to the effectiveness of early-stage crop row-following. The main contribution of our paper is the proposal of RASCM, which is a novel method in the field of early-stage crop row-following and can be used as a basic reference for subsequent work in this research field. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture Robotics; Lightweight Dcnn; Row Anchor Classification; Row Anchor Selection; Visual-based Navigation; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Deep Neural Networks; Navigation; Robotics; Robots; Anchor Selection; Classification Methods; Crop Rows; Ghostnet; Lightweight Deep Convolutional Neural Network; Navigation Tasks; Row Anchor Classification; Row Anchor Selection; Row Following; Visual-based Navigation; Classification (of Information); Accuracy Assessment; Agricultural Policy; Classification; Data Set; Experimental Study; Precision Agriculture; Robotics; Seedling","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep neural networks; Navigation; Robotics; Robots; Anchor selection; Classification methods; Crop rows; Ghostnet; Lightweight deep convolutional neural network; Navigation tasks; Row anchor classification; Row anchor selection; Row following; Visual-based navigation; Classification (of information); accuracy assessment; agricultural policy; classification; data set; experimental study; precision agriculture; robotics; seedling","","","The authors gratefully appreciate the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52075092) and the Provincial Postdoctoral Landing Project (LBH-Q19007).","Adhikari, Shyam Prasad, Learning Semantic Graphics Using Convolutional Encoder–Decoder Network for Autonomous Weeding in Paddy, Frontiers in Plant Science, 10, (2019); Andersen, Richard A., Encoding of spatial location by posterior parietal neurons, Science, 230, 4724, pp. 456-458, (1985); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2017); García-Santillán, Iván D., Automatic detection of curved and straight crop rows from images in maize fields, Biosystems Engineering, 156, pp. 61-79, (2017); Giusti, Alessandro, A Machine Learning Approach to Visual Perception of Forest Trails for Mobile Robots, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 1, 2, pp. 661-667, (2016); undefined, (2020); Journal of Northwest University Nat Sci Ed, (2011); undefined, (2017); Huang, Shuangping, Deep localization model for intra-row crop detection in paddy field, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 169, (2020)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01681699","","CEAGE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120463362"

Through the thoughtful utilization of modern computer vision techniques, it is possible to achieve positive financial and environmental results for these tasks. This work introduces an automation framework that attempts to address the three main drawbacks of existing approaches: 1) lack of generality (methods are tuned for specific data sets); 2) difficulty to apply in variable field conditions; and 3) lack of tool sophistication that limits their applicability. The cultivation of corn lies in the core of the American and global economy with 81.7 million acres harvested only in the USA for the year 2018. The ubiquity of its cultivation makes it an ideal candidate to highlight the large economic benefits from even a small improvement in nutrient deficiency detection. The proposed methodology utilizes drone collected images to detect nitrogen (N) deficiencies in maize fields and assess their severity using low-cost RGB sensors. The proposed methodology is twofold. A low complexity recommendation scheme identifies candidate plants exhibiting N deficiency and, with minimal interaction, assists the annotator in the creation of a training data set that is then used to train an object detection deep neural network. Results on data from experimental fields support the merits of the proposed methodology with mean average precision for the detection of N-deficient leaves reaching 82.3%. Note to Practitioners - The motivation behind this article is the problem of inefficient fertilizer application in corn fields throughout the cultivation season. Current widely spread techniques to counter plant malnutrition suggest the application of excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer prior to seeding or the uniform application during the plant growth. These practices result in financial losses and have severe environmental consequences, e.g., the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. We propose an automation framework that automatically detects corn nitrogen deficiencies in the field during the plants' growth, and to achieve our goal, we employ low-cost robotic platforms and RGB sensors. The framework that we developed is able to detect the characteristic pattern of nitrogen deficiency on corn leaves and provide an estimation of the in-field spatial variability of the deficiency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automation In Agriculture; Nitrogen Deficiency; Plant Deficiency; Precision Agriculture (pa); Remote Sensing (rs); Automation; Costs; Deep Neural Networks; Losses; Nitrogen Fertilizers; Object Detection; Plants (botany); Precision Agriculture; Seed; Automation In Agriculture; Corn Fields; Low-costs; N Deficiencies; Nitrogen Deficiency; Plant Deficiency; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Remote-sensing","Automation; Costs; Deep neural networks; Losses; Nitrogen fertilizers; Object detection; Plants (botany); Precision agriculture; Seed; Automation in agriculture; Corn fields; Low-costs; N deficiencies; Nitrogen deficiency; Plant deficiency; Precision Agriculture; Remote sensing; Remote-sensing","","","","World of Corn, (2019); Farm Size and the Organization of U S Crop Farming, (2013); Schlüter, Urte, Maize source leaf adaptation to nitrogen deficiency affects not only nitrogen and carbon metabolism but also control of phosphate homeostasis, Plant Physiology, 160, 3, pp. 1384-1406, (2012); Mississippi River Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force, (2015); Osborne, Shannon Lynn, Detection of phosphorus and nitrogen deficiencies in corn using spectral radiance measurements, Agronomy Journal, 94, 6, pp. 1215-1221, (2002); Bechar, Avital, Agricultural robots for field operations: Concepts and components, Biosystems Engineering, 149, pp. 94-111, (2016); Kyveryga, Peter M., Normalization of uncalibrated late-season digital aerial imagery for evaluating corn nitrogen status, Precision Agriculture, 13, 1, pp. 2-16, (2012); Barbedo, Jayme G.A., Digital image processing techniques for detecting, quantifying and classifying plant diseases, SpringerPlus, 2, 1, pp. 1-12, (2013); Barbedo, Jayme G.A., A review on the main challenges in automatic plant disease identification based on visible range images, Biosystems Engineering, 144, pp. 52-60, (2016); Zermas, Dimitris, Automation solutions for the evaluation of plant health in corn fields, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2015-December, pp. 6521-6527, (2015)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","15455955","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116910264"

A recent review of the literature showed that the use of precision farming technologies and the development and adoption of open data standards was particularly low in extensive livestock farming. However, a plethora of public datasets exist that have the potential to be used to inform precision farming decision tools. Using extensive livestock farming in Australia as example, we investigate the quantity and quality of datasets available via a systematic dataset review. This systematic review of datasets begins with a search of open data catalogues and querying these to find datasets. Software scripts are developed and used to query the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of many of the large data catalogues in Australia, while catalogues without public APIs are queried manually via available web portals. Following the systematic search, a combined list of all datasets is collated and tested for FAIRness and other quality metrics.

Considering the lack of a mechanistic model that predicts daily feed intake in lactating sows, a novel approach combining an online forecasting procedure with an offline learning procedure is proposed. A database of 39,090 lactations, from 6 different farms and containing the first 20 daily feed intake records after farrowing, was used (1) to identify consistent sets of clusters and trajectory curves offline, and (2) to test 3 predictive functions of daily feed intake online. The homogeneity of the clusters resulting from the offline learning procedure was assessed according to Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz scores. The predictive quality of forecasting functions was assessed with the Mean Error (ME), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Time-series clustering with k-Shape makes it possible to extract consistent trajectory curves that are scale-, shift- and translate-invariant. The best number of clusters obtained either in a global approach or at farm scale was two. The trajectory curve of the first cluster is characterized by a mostly continuous increase of feed intake over the course of lactation, and the second cluster by a plateau in feed intake starting from about the 10th day of lactation. These identified trajectory curves are consistent with the very few studies available in the literature. When computed with the best forecasting function and farm specific trajectory curves, the ME of feed intake over lactation was −0.08 kg/d, and the corresponding RMSE was 1.06 kg/d. Though variability in feed intake among sows and over the lactation period is high, online forecasting of feed intake can be improved by the use of feed intake trajectory curves. These trajectory curves may be computed on a regular basis with data obtained directly on the farm or on farms with similar practices.

This represents a real threat to our food security and puts the current food production system under pressure. Efficient use of Earth's natural resources is the only solution to facing future challenges such as global hunger. The implementation of precision agriculture using new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, IoT and remote sensing is the first step towards this goal. In this paper, we investigated several machine learning models to create two services: one for recommending the best crop to grow based on soil and the region's weather characteristics, and another for the forecasting of the hourly average air temperature. Performance evaluation results for the first service show that Random Forest has the best metrics as a classifier (accuracy = 100%, precision = 100%, recall = 100%) compared to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, and Feed Forward Neural Network. This is a confirmation that classic machine learning algorithms perform better on small-size datasets. In our case, we used a dataset of 2200 instances available online. On the other hand, Facebook Prophet was more accurate (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 3.74) than our proposed LSTM architecture in time series forecasting at hourly scale using historical weather data provided by the weather station of our study area. These two optimal models are then integrated as the first building blocks in our decision support platform, intended for both farmers and policymakers with the aim of making agriculture in Morocco more efficient and more sustainable. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Decision Support Systems; Deep Learning; Facebook Prophet; Lstm; Machine Learning; Precision Agriculture; Smart Agriculture; Weather Forecasting; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Decision Support Systems; Decision Trees; Deep Learning; Food Supply; Logistic Regression; Nearest Neighbor Search; Precision Agriculture; Random Forests; Remote Sensing; Weather Forecasting; Agricultural Decision Support; Agricultural Decision Support System; Facebook; Facebook Prophet; Lstm; Machine Learning Approaches; Machine-learning; Precision Agriculture; Smart Agricultures; Population Statistics","Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Deep learning; Food supply; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Precision agriculture; Random forests; Remote sensing; Weather forecasting; Agricultural decision support; Agricultural decision support system; Facebook; Facebook prophet; LSTM; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Precision Agriculture; Smart agricultures; Population statistics","","","","Cleland, John G.F., World Population Growth; Past, Present and Future, Environmental and Resource Economics, 55, 4, pp. 543-554, (2013); Jacob, Daniel J., Effect of climate change on air quality, Atmospheric Environment, 43, 1, pp. 51-63, (2009); Journal of Geographical Sciences, (2002); Doungmanee, Piamchan, The nexus of agricultural water use and economic development level, Kasetsart Journal of Social Sciences, 37, 1, pp. 38-45, (2016); Business Opportunities Report for Reuse of Wastewater in Morocco, (2018); Hssaisoune, Mohammed, Moroccan groundwater resources and evolution with global climate changes, Geosciences (Switzerland), 10, 2, (2020); Mind, (1950); Silver, David, A general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess, shogi, and Go through self-play, Science, 362, 6419, pp. 1140-1144, (2018); Li, Xiuquan, An exploration on artificial intelligence application: From security, privacy and ethic perspective, pp. 416-420, (2017); Kieslich, Kimon, The Threats of Artificial Intelligence Scale (TAI): Development, Measurement and Test Over Three Application Domains, International Journal of Social Robotics, 13, 7, pp. 1563-1577, (2021)","Ahmed, M.B.; Abdelhakim, B.A.; Atlas, A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Ensa Marrakech; Faculte des Sciences et Techniques; Marrakech; Universite Abdelmalek Essaadi; Universite Cadi Ayyad","2nd International Conference on Digital Age and Technological Advances for Sustainable Development, ICDATA 2021","","Marrakech","173760","","9781665429016","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119528707"

The adaptation of a more quantitative risk-based approach, with metrics such as Food safety Objectives (FSO) and Performance Objectives (PO) necessitates quantitative inputs from all stages of the food value chain. The potential exists for utilization of big data, generated through digital transformational technologies, as inputs to a dynamic risk management concept for food safety microbiology. The industrial revolution in Internet of Things (IoT) will leverage data inputs from precision agriculture, connected factories/logistics, precision healthcare, and precision food safety, to improve the dynamism of microbial risk management. Furthermore, interconnectivity of public health databases, social media, and e-commerce tools as well as technologies such as blockchain will enhance traceability for retrospective and real-time management of foodborne cases. Despite the enormous potential of data volume and velocity, some challenges remain, including data ownership, interoperability, and accessibility.

Row-based crops are the perfect settings to test and deploy smart machines capable of monitoring and manage the harvest. In this context, global path generation is essential either for ground or aerial vehicles, and it is the starting point for every type of mission plan. Nevertheless, little attention has been currently given to this problem by the research community and global path generation automation is still far to be solved. In order to generate a viable path for an autonomous machine, the presented research proposes a feature learning fully convolutional model capable of estimating waypoints given an occupancy grid map. In particular, we apply the proposed data-driven methodology to the specific case of row-based crops with the general objective to generate a global path able to cover the extension of the crop completely. Extensive experimentation with a custom made synthetic dataset and real satellite-derived images of different scenarios have proved the effectiveness of our methodology and demonstrated the feasibility of an end-to-end and completely autonomous global path planner. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Global Path Planning; Precision Agriculture; Unmanned Ground Vehicles; Antennas; Crops; Deep Learning; Ground Vehicles; Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems; Precision Agriculture; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Aerial Vehicle; Agricultural Process; Crop Quality; Global Path Planning; Path-generation; Precision Agriculture; Service Robotics; Smarter Machines; Waypoints; Motion Planning; Agricultural Development; Agricultural Technology; Data Set; Harvesting; Learning; Machinery; Robotics; Yield Response","Antennas; Crops; Deep learning; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Precision agriculture; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Agricultural process; Crop quality; Global path planning; Path-generation; Precision Agriculture; Service robotics; Smarter machines; Waypoints; Motion planning; agricultural development; agricultural technology; data set; harvesting; learning; machinery; robotics; yield response","","","","Abadi, Martín, TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning, pp. 265-283, (2016); Aghi, Diego, Autonomous Navigation in Vineyards with Deep Learning at the Edge, Mechanisms and Machine Science, 84, pp. 479-486, (2020); Aghi, Diego, Local motion planner for autonomous navigation in vineyards with a RGB-D camera-based algorithm and deep learning synergy, Machines, 8, 2, (2020); Astolfi, Pietro, Vineyard Autonomous Navigation in the Echord++ GRAPE Experiment, 51, 11, pp. 704-709, (2018); Barawid, Oscar C., Development of an Autonomous Navigation System using a Two-dimensional Laser Scanner in an Orchard Application, Biosystems Engineering, 96, 2, pp. 139-149, (2007); Comba, Lorenzo, Unsupervised detection of vineyards by 3D point-cloud UAV photogrammetry for precision agriculture, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 155, pp. 84-95, (2018); Costa, Márcia M., A Survey on Path Planning Algorithms for Mobile Robots, (2019); Craw, Susan M., Manhattan Distance, pp. 790-791, (2017); undefined, (1996); Everingham, Mark, The pascal visual object classes (VOC) challenge, International Journal of Computer Vision, 88, 2, pp. 303-338, (2010)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01681699","","CEAGE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103275872"

In addition, the growing world population creates an increasing demand for food production, which requires all countries of the world to join hands and cooperate to achieve food security. Agriculture data collection and analysis using emergent technologies such as IoT devices, cloud services, and big data is in the early development stages; however, it has been adopted and experimented with in many regions worldwide. These technologies demonstrated the ability to improve crop productivity and quality, minimize resource consumption, and reduce the impact on the environment. This study aims to establish the first phase in ongoing research on 'AGRO Big Data: Toward Smart farming in the Kingdom of Bahrain' by designing a conceptual IoT-based framework that employs cloud services and big data tools. The kingdom of Bahrain is a small island that suffers from water scarcity and harsh soil conditions. It is considered a non-agriculture country and highly dependent on imported crops. The proposed framework will identify different agriculture stakeholders (users) in Bahrain and data domains such as soil sensors and weather stations. It will suggest using a mobile application (AgroBahrain) to collect and disseminate farm-related data along with the adoption of Google cloud services for the storage and transformation of agriculture big data. The framework is divided into two modules: 1- data collection and storage module, 2- data diffusion module. It concentrates on plants and crops data, excluding cattle and livestock. The framework is the first to build a conceptual process of collection, storage, and transformation of agriculture data in Bahrain. It is aligned with the kingdom's agriculture strategy developed early 2010. Moreover, the framework paves the road towards advancing the research in different agriculture-related fields, such as soil and crop quality. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture Sustainability; Cloud Computing; Farming As A Service; Precision Agriculture; Smart Farming; Big Data; Cloud Computing; Crops; Digital Storage; Distributed Database Systems; Food Supply; Greenhouse Gases; Internet Of Things; Metadata; Soils; Sustainable Development; Web Services; Agriculture Data; Agriculture Sustainability; Bahrain; Cloud Services; Cloud-computing; Farming As A Service; Food Security; Precision Agriculture; Smart Farming; Water Scarcity; Precision Agriculture","Big data; Cloud computing; Crops; Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Internet of things; Metadata; Soils; Sustainable development; Web services; Agriculture data; Agriculture sustainability; Bahrain; Cloud services; Cloud-computing; Farming as a service; Food security; Precision Agriculture; Smart farming; Water scarcity; Precision agriculture","","","","Sarker, Md Nazirul Islam, Role of big data on digital farming, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 9, 4, pp. 1222-1225, (2020); Mckinsey Global Institute, (2011); Hashem, Ibrahim Abaker Targio, The rise of ""big data"" on cloud computing: Review and open research issues, Information Systems, 47, pp. 98-115, (2015); Huang, Yanbo, Agricultural remote sensing big data: Management and applications, Journal of Integrative Agriculture, 17, 9, pp. 1915-1931, (2018); Shebeb, Bassim, Productivity growth: Bahrain agriculture and fisheries sector, Emirates Journal of Food and Agriculture, 18, 2, pp. 29-46, (2006); Arabian Gulf University Graduate Programs List; Irrigation in the Middle East Region in Figures, (2008); Delgado, Jorge A., Big Data Analysis for Sustainable Agriculture on a Geospatial Cloud Framework, Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, 3, (2019); Li, Chunling, Design of smart agriculture based on big data and Internet of things, International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, 16, 5, (2020); Gill, Sukhpal Singh, IoT based agriculture as a cloud and big data service: The beginning of digital India, Journal of Organizational and End User Computing, 29, 4, pp. 1-23, (2017)","Li, X.; He, D.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st International Conference on Electronic Information Technology and Smart Agriculture, ICEITSA 2021","","Huaihua","177302","","9781665413008","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126870470"

However, technologies and innovations in the Precision Agriculture (PA) domain are still in their infancy. Typically, the problem of incorrect identification of crop disease still remains unsolved, thus causes agricultural production losses worldwide. To solve this problem, we apply transfer learning based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify different diseases of the crops. Specifically, this study focuses on evaluating the identification performance of the four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures: Residual Network (ResNet), MobileNet GoogLeNet and AlexNet. The PlantVillage dataset used in this study is made publicly available for academic study at Kaggle repository, which consists of 54,323 images of 38 kinds of crop diseases, and 14 kinds of crop diseases from them are derived as dataset for this study.

An efficient monitoring system that identifies and counts SWD in crops and their surroundings is therefore essential for integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. Existing methods, such as catching flies in liquid bait traps and counting them manually, are costly, time-consuming and labour-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we studied insect trap monitoring using image-based object detection with deep learning. RESULTS: Based on an image database with 4753 annotated SWD flies, we trained a ResNet-18-based deep convolutional neural network to detect and count SWD, including sex prediction and discrimination. The results show that SWD can be detected with an area under the precision recall curve (AUC) of 0.506 (female) and 0.603 (male) in digital images taken from a static position. For images collected using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the algorithm detected SWD individuals with an AUC of 0.086 (female) and 0.284 (male). The lower AUC for the aerial imagery was due to lower image quality caused by stabilisation manoeuvres of the UAV during image collection. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that it is possible to monitor SWD using deep learning and object detection. Moreover, the results demonstrate the potential of UAVs to monitor insect traps, which could be valuable in the development of autonomous insect monitoring systems and IPM. © 2020 The Authors.

A probabilistic image segmentation method is first presented to segment a red–green–blue image as a binary mask. Multiplied by this mask, a filtered depth image is obtained. Region growing, a region-based image segmentation method, is then applied to group the depth image into multiple clusters. Each cluster represents a fruit, leaf, or branch that is later transformed into a point cloud. Next, a 3D shape detection method based on M-estimator sample consensus, a model parameter estimator, is employed to detect potential fruits from each point cloud. Finally, an angle/color/shape-based global point cloud descriptor (GPCD) is developed to extract a feature vector for an entire point cloud, and a support vector machine classifier trained on the GPCD features is used to exclude false positives. Pepper, eggplant, and guava datasets were captured in the field. For the pepper, eggplant, and guava datasets, the detection precision was 0.864, 0.886, and 0.888, and the recall was 0.889, 0.762, and 0.812, respectively.

In this study, real-time ER measurement system has been developed with the help of an autonomous robot. The aim of this study is to provide rapid measurement of the ER in large areas using the Wenner four-probe measurement method for precision farming applications. The ER measurement platform consists of the Wenner probes, a y-axis shifter driven by a DC motor through a gear reducer, all installed on a steel-frame that mount to an autonomous robot. An embedded industrial computer and differential global positioning system (DGPS) were used to assist in real-time measuring, recording, mapping, and displaying the ER and the robot position during the field operation. The data acquisition software was codded in Microsoft Visual Basic.NET. Field experiments were carried out in a 1.2 ha farmland soil. ER and DGPS values were stored in Microsoft SQL Server 2005 database, an ordinary Kriging interpolation technique by ArcGIS was used and the average ER values were mapped for the soil depth between 0 and 50 cm. As a result, ER values were observed to be between 30.757 and 70.732 ohm-m. In conclusion, the experimental results showed that the designed system works quite well in the field and the ER measurement platform is a practical tool for providing real-time soil ER measurements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Robot; Mapping; Precision Farming; Real-time Measurement; Soil; Soil Electrical Resistivity; Agriculture; Data Acquisition; Dc Motors; Electric Conductivity; Indicators (chemical); Interpolation; Mapping; Probes; Robots; Soils; Textures; Time Measurement; Windows Operating System; Data Acquisition Softwares; Differential Global Positioning Systems; Electrical Resistivity Measurements; Four-probe Measurement; Precision Farming; Real Time Measurements; Soil Electrical Resistivities; Soil Physical And Chemical Properties; Soil Surveys; Agricultural Land; Article; Field Experiment; Global Positioning System; Human; Kriging; Precision Agriculture; Robotics; Software; Soil Depth","Agriculture; Data acquisition; DC motors; Electric conductivity; Indicators (chemical); Interpolation; Mapping; Probes; Robots; Soils; Textures; Time measurement; Windows operating system; Data acquisition softwares; Differential global positioning systems; Electrical resistivity measurements; Four-probe measurement; Precision farming; Real time measurements; Soil electrical resistivities; Soil physical and chemical properties; Soil surveys; agricultural land; article; field experiment; global positioning system; human; kriging; precision agriculture; robotics; software; soil depth","","","Funding text 1: Author Contributions: İ.Ü. was responsible for the project administration, conceptualization, data curation, formal analysis, methodology, software, and writing—original draft.

In addition there are now readily available national and global datasets, such as rainfall and MODIS, which can be used to represent the crop-growing environment. Rather than analysing one field at a time as is typical in precision agriculture research, there is an opportunity to explore the value of combining data over multiple fields/farms and years into one dataset. Using these datasets in conjunction with machine learning approaches allows predictive models of crop yield to be built. In this study, several large farms in Western Australia were used as a case study, and yield monitor data from wheat, barley and canola crops from three different seasons (2013, 2014 and 2015) that covered ~ 11 000 to ~ 17 000 hectares in each year were used. The yield data were processed to a 10 m grid, and for each observation point associated predictor variables in space and time were collated. The data were then aggregated to a 100 m spatial resolution for modelling yield. Random forest models were used to predict crop yield of wheat, barley and canola using this dataset. Three separate models were created based on pre-sowing, mid-season and late-season conditions to explore the changes in the predictive ability of the model as more within-season information became available. These time points also coincide with points in the season when a management decision is made, such as the application of fertiliser. The models were evaluated with cross-validation using both fields and years for data splitting, and this was assessed at the field spatial resolution. Cross-validated results showed the models predicted yield relatively accurately, with a root mean square error of 0.36 to 0.42 t ha−1, and a Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient of 0.89 to 0.92 at the field resolution. The models performed better as the season progressed, largely because more information about within-season data became available (e.g. rainfall). The more years of yield data that were available for a field, the better the predictions were, and future work should use a longer time-series of yield data. The generic nature of this method makes it possible to apply to other agricultural systems where yield monitor data is available. Future work should also explore the integration of more data sources into the models, focus on predicting at finer spatial resolutions within fields, and the possibility of using the yield forecasts to guide management decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Empirical Yield Prediction; Feature Extraction; Machine Learning; Precision Agriculture; Random Forest; Remote Sensing; Yield Forecast; Agricultural Research; Algorithm; Barley; Canola; Crop Yield; Data Set; Empirical Analysis; Forecasting Method; Machine Learning; Modis; Precision Agriculture; Prediction; Rainfall; Remote Sensing; Soil Test; Spatial Resolution; Time Series Analysis; Wheat; Australia; Western Australia; Brassica Napus Var.

However, the value of the maps can be compromised by the presence of systematic and random errors in raw within field data. In this paper, an automated method to clean yield maps is proposed so as to ensure the quality of further data processing and management decisions. First, data were screened by filtering null and edge yield values as well global outliers. Second, spatial outliers or local defective observations were deleted. The local Moran’s index of spatial autocorrelation and Moran’s plot were used as tool to identify the spatial outliers. The protocol to filter out global and local outliers was evaluated on 595 real yield datasets from different grain crops. Significant improvements in the distribution and spatial structure of yield datasets was found. Approximately 30% of the dataset size was removed from each monitor dataset, with one third of the removal occurring during filtering of spatial outliers. The automation of null, edge yield values and the removal of global outliers improved yield distributions, whereas the cleaning of local outliers impacted the yield spatial structure for all yield maps and crops. The algorithm proposed to clean yield maps is easy to apply for preprocessing the growing number of available yield maps. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Global Outliers; Local Outliers; Spatial Data Mining; Agricultural Technology; Autocorrelation; Automation; Data Mining; Data Processing; Data Set; Error Analysis; Management Practice; Precision Agriculture; Removal Experiment; Yield Response","agricultural technology; autocorrelation; automation; data mining; data processing; data set; error analysis; management practice; precision agriculture; removal experiment; yield response","","","Funding text 1: Fig. 5 RSV in raw yield data (white), in monitor data filtered with Step 1 of a proposed protocol for error removal (grey), and after Step 1 + 2 (black).

In this study, we collected records of monthly temperature at 1153 stations and precipitation at 1202 stations in China and neighboring countries to construct a monthly climate dataset in China with a 0.025° resolution (~ 2.5 km). The dataset, named LZU0025, was designed by Lanzhou University and used a partial thin plate smoothing method embedded in the ANUSPLIN software. The accuracy of LZU0025 was evaluated based on three aspects: (1) Diagnostic statistics from the surface fitting model during 1951–2011. The results indicate a low mean square root of generalized cross validation (RTGCV) for the monthly air temperature surface (1.06 °C) and monthly precipitation surface (1.97 mm1/2). The method used variable square root transformation for the spline surface fitting to reduce positive skewness in the measured precipitation values and no variable transformation in air temperature case. This indicates that the surface fitting models are accurate. (2) Error statistics of comparisons between interpolated monthly LZU0025 with the withholding of climatic data from 265 stations during 1951–2011. The results show that the predicted values closely tracked the real true values with values of mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.59 °C and 70.5 mm and standard deviation of the mean error (STD) of 1.27 °C and 122.6 mm. In addition, the monthly STDs exhibited a consistent pattern of variation with RTGCV. (3) Comparison with other datasets. This was done in two ways. The first was via comparison of standard deviation, mean, and time trend derived from all datasets to a reference dataset released by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), using Taylor diagrams. The second was to compare LZU0025 with the station dataset in the Tibetan Plateau. Taylor diagrams show that the standard deviation derived from LZU had a higher correlation with that produced by the CMA (R = 0.76 for air temperature, and R = 0.96 for precipitation) compared to those from other datasets. The standard deviation for the index derived from LZU was more close to that induced from CMA, and the centered normalized root-mean-square difference for this index derived from LZU and CMA was lower. A similar superior performance of LZU was found in the comparison of mean and time trend derived from LZU and those from other datasets. LZU0025 had high correlation with the Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observation Project (CEOP)—Asian Monsoon Project (CAMP) Tibet surface meteorology station dataset for air temperature, despite a non-significant correlation for precipitation at a few stations. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we conclude that LZU0025 is a reliable dataset. LZU0025, which has a fine resolution, can be used to identify a greater number of climate types, such as tundra and subpolar continental, along the Himalayan Mountain. We anticipate that LZU0025 can be used for the monitoring of regional climate change and precision agriculture modulation under global climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Temperature; Climate Change; Complex Terrain; Data Set; Monitoring; Optimization; Precipitation (climatology); Precision Agriculture; Regional Climate; Spatial Resolution; Temperature Profile; Temporal Variation; Topography; China","air temperature; climate change; complex terrain; data set; monitoring; optimization; precipitation (climatology); precision agriculture; regional climate; spatial resolution; temperature profile; temporal variation; topography; China","","","","Anwar, Muhuddin Rajin, Adapting agriculture to climate change: A review, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 113, 1-2, pp. 225-245, (2013); Belda, Michal, Climate classification revisited: From Köppen to Trewartha, Climate Research, 59, 1, pp. 1-13, (2014); Brown, Josephine R., Evaluation of the South Pacific convergence zone in IPCC AR4 climate model simulations of the twentieth century, Journal of Climate, 24, 6, pp. 1565-1582, (2011); Chen, Shuai, Impacts of climate change on agriculture: Evidence from China, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 76, pp. 105-124, (2016); Ciabatta, Luca, Comparison of different satellite rainfall products over the italian territory, pp. 623-626, (2015); Lo Conti, Francesco, Evaluation and comparison of satellite precipitation estimates with reference to a local area in the Mediterranean Sea, Atmospheric Research, 138, pp. 189-204, (2014); Craven, Peter, Smoothing noisy data with spline functions - Estimating the correct degree of smoothing by the method of generalized cross-validation, Numerische Mathematik, 31, 4, pp. 377-403, (1978); Dee, Dick P., The ERA-Interim reanalysis: Configuration and performance of the data assimilation system, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 137, 656, pp. 553-597, (2011); Ding, Yihui, Detection, causes and projection of climate change over China: An overview of recent progress, Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, 24, 6, pp. 954-971, (2007); Fan, Yun, A global monthly land surface air temperature analysis for 1948-present, Journal of Geophysical Research, 113, 1, (2008)","","Springer-Verlag Wien michaela.bolli@springer.at","","","","","","14344483; 0177798X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063556812"

An experimental vehicle was equipped with a Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS), a Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG)and a new type of camera developed by Fujifilm Corporation. The camera can shoot wide angle and telephoto images simultaneously, so it was possible to use it in combination with the RTK-GPS and image processing algorithms to build a field map containing up to ten crop rows. In addition, it was possible to use the crop row detection data obtained from the telephoto image to increase the accuracy of the data obtained from the wide angle image by means of a simple data fusion technique. The results show a reasonable amount of theoretical error for the resulting map, which contains an increased number of crop rows in comparison to traditional mapping methods. Additionally, results also evaluate the error and noise reduction for the crop row detection algorithm; which suggest that the machine vision method introduced in this research displays accuracy improvement in comparison to other methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crop Mapping; Crop Row Detection; Fog; Machine Vision; Precision Agriculture; Rtk-gps; Cameras; Computer Vision; Crops; Data Fusion; Fiber Optics; Fog; Gyroscopes; Mapping; Noise Abatement; Optical Data Processing; Precision Agriculture; Accuracy Improvement; Crop Mapping; Crop Row Detection; Data Fusion Technique; Fiber Optic Gyroscopes; Image Processing Algorithm; Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (rtk Gps); Rtk-gps; Global Positioning System; Accuracy Assessment; Algorithm; Data Set; Detection Method; Equipment; Gps; Image Analysis; Image Processing; Mapping Method; Precision Agriculture","Cameras; Computer vision; Crops; Data fusion; Fiber optics; Fog; Gyroscopes; Mapping; Noise abatement; Optical data processing; Precision agriculture; Accuracy Improvement; Crop mapping; Crop row detection; Data fusion technique; Fiber optic gyroscopes; Image processing algorithm; Real time kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS); RTK-GPS; Global positioning system; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data set; detection method; equipment; GPS; image analysis; image processing; mapping method; precision agriculture","","","","Computer Graphics and Geometric Modeling Implementation and Algorithms, (2005); Åstrand, Björn S., A vision based row-following system for agricultural field machinery, Mechatronics, 15, 2, pp. 251-269, (2005); Barnard, Stephen T., Interpreting perspective images, Artificial Intelligence, 21, 4, pp. 435-462, (1983); Bengochea-Guevara, José M., Merge fuzzy visual servoing and GPS-based planning to obtain a proper navigation behavior for a small crop-inspection robot, Sensors, 16, 3, (2016); Bevilacqua, Alessandro, Automatic perspective camera calibration based on an incomplete set of chessboard markers *, pp. 126-133, (2008); Learning Opencv Computer Vision with the Opencv Library, (2008); Practical Opencv, (2013); Castanedo, F., A review of data fusion techniques, Scientific World Journal, 2013, (2013); Image Processing on Line, (2014); Digital Image Processing, (2002)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01681699","","CEAGE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065239993"

However, a structured analysis of the published material is still missing. Thus, this study attempts to analyze the global scientific output of precision agriculture researches published during the period 2000–2016. By using a science mapping approach, mainly based on the application of network analysis tools, it was possible to investigate pivotal aspects of this research field such as publication trends, research topics and their geographical distribution. Using the Scopus database 17,756 scientific publications were retrieved from the chosen period. The number of publications increased after 2006, highlighting the vibrancy of the field. By authoring 35% of the publications, U.S.A. and China were the most active knowledge producer countries. Moreover, the generation of time resolved maps allowed us to identify agriculture engineering, computer science and agriculture studies as three main research areas characterizing precision agriculture panorama. The paper discusses the distribution of these topics at global level, among European countries and in Italy. Overall, this analysis represents the first holistic view of precision agriculture research providing valuable information for farmers, policy makers and researchers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bibliometrics; Precision Farming; Scientific Publications; Scopus; Terms Mapping; European Union; Farming System; Global Perspective; Growth; Mapping Method; Network Analysis; Policy Making; Precision Agriculture; Research Method; China; Italy; Scopus","European Union; farming system; global perspective; growth; mapping method; network analysis; policy making; precision agriculture; research method; China; Italy; Scopus","","","Acknowledgements This paper was funded with the contribution of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry Policies (MiPAAF) project AGROENER (D.D. n. 26329).

The agricultural sector has the largest share in the water footprint of humanity. While most studies focus on estimating water footprints (WFs) of crops through modeling, there are only few experimental field studies. The current work aims to understand the effect of supposedly better agricultural practices, particularly precision agriculture (variable rate application of fertilizers and pesticides) and conservation agriculture (minimum, strip, or no-tillage), on water deterioration and water pollution. We analyzed the results from an experimental field study in the northeast of Italy, in which four different crops are grown across three years of crops rotation. We compared minimum, strip, and no-tillage systems undergoing variable to uniform rate application. Grey WFs are assessed based on a field dataset using yield maps data, soil texture, and crop operations field. Leaching and associated grey WFs are assessed based on application rates and various environmental factors. Yields are measured in the field and recorded in a precision map. The results illustrate how precision agriculture combined with soil conservation tillage systems can reduce the grey water footprint by the 10%. We assessed the grey Water Footprint for all the field operation processes during the three-year crop rotation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture Soil Practices; Conservation Tillage Systems; Impact Reduction; Precision Agriculture; Sustainable Management; Water Footprint; Agricultural Management; Agricultural Practice; Agroindustry; Alternative Agriculture; Climate Change; Condition Factor; Conservation Tillage; Crop Rotation; Crop Yield; Economic Growth; Environmental Factor; Precision Agriculture; Soil Conservation; Water Footprint; Zero Tillage; Italy","agricultural management; agricultural practice; agroindustry; alternative agriculture; climate change; condition factor; conservation tillage; crop rotation; crop yield; economic growth; environmental factor; precision agriculture; soil conservation; water footprint; zero tillage; Italy","","","Funding text 1: Funding: The research has been supported by the Ph.D. grant provided by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo (CARIPARO).

Acquisition of soil spectra on-the-go has several advantages over 'in-situ' static approaches, like deriving information with high spatial density. However, issues concerning on-the-go spectral measurements exist, mainly due to sensor movement and heterogeneous soil condition in the field. Procedures to mitigate these drawbacks, like external parameter orthogonalization (EPO) and direct standardization (DS), have mainly been applied so far to static spectral readings. In this study, EPO, DS and orthogonal signal correction (OSC) are tested in the context of on-the-go spectra acquisition for prediction of soil properties related to liming (i.e., pH in CaCl<inf>2</inf>, pH in SMP buffer, concentration of organic matter, calcium and magnesium, potential acidity, sum of basis, cation exchange capacity and its saturation by basis, lime requirement and moisture content). A detailed dataset (300 soil samples coupled with laboratory and field spectral measurements) was acquired in two sites in Brazil with contrasting soil attributes (site 1 with ‘clayey texture’ – Ferralsol; site 2 with 'sandy texture’ – Alisol), and variability of soil properties was increased in these sites through application of different limestone rates in experimental plots. Spectral correction procedures slightly improved the accuracy of lime requirement predictions, with reduction of root mean squared error (RMSE) from 1.43 to 1.17 t ha−1, for study site 1 after applying OSC, and from 0.59 to 0.44 t ha−1, for study site 2 after DS was implemented. However, models based on laboratory data still performed considerably better with RMSE of 0.99 and 0.43 t ha−1 for site 1 and 2, respectively. ‘Global’ (i.e., one general correction model for a given field) or 'specific’ models (i.e., several correction models, derived according to clusters obtained through fuzzy k-means applied to OSC components) performed considerably worse in comparison with other studies. Probably occurrence of external factors affecting the spectral information was not constant in the mapped fields. Also, different external factors may have affected the spectra at the same time and efficiency of the correction procedures decreased. Considering the high sensitivity of predictions based on field data to the approach used to interpolate the spectra and the poor performance of the correction methods applied in this context, more investigation is needed to improve predictions based on spectral data acquired on-the-go. Homogeneous spatial distribution of factors not related to the properties of interest, or at least in a degree allowing correction by the methods tested here, may not happen when current measurement systems are used. Despite that, spatial patterns described by wet-chemical analysis could be represented, at certain extent, through predicted values of lime requirement (LR), derived from field spectra. For instance, predictions after spectral correction resulted in autocorrelation patterns and map of LR comparable with those observed using conventional methods, for the site 1. These results, coupled with a semiquantitative potential of predictions based on field data after spectral correction, indicate that on-the-go measurements have potential for soil properties characterization, although full quantitative potential will require further advances in sensing solutions and chemometric methods applied in this context. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","External Parameters; Orthogonal Signal Correction; Precision Agriculture; Proximal Soil Sensing; Soil Chemical Properties; Chemical Analysis; Environmental Impact; Forecasting; Forestry; Lime; Mean Square Error; Reflection; Soils; Standardization; External Parameters; Orthogonal Signal Correction; Precision Agriculture; Proximal Soil Sensing; Soil Chemical Property; Soil Surveys; Assessment Method; Autocorrelation; Cation Exchange Capacity; Environmental Impact; Heterogeneity; Parameterization; Performance Assessment; Precision Agriculture; Reflectance; Soil Analysis; Soil Chemistry; Soil Property; Spatial Distribution; Standardization; Brazil","Chemical analysis; Environmental impact; Forecasting; Forestry; Lime; Mean square error; Reflection; Soils; Standardization; External parameters; Orthogonal signal correction; Precision Agriculture; Proximal soil sensing; Soil chemical property; Soil surveys; assessment method; autocorrelation; cation exchange capacity; environmental impact; heterogeneity; parameterization; performance assessment; precision agriculture; reflectance; soil analysis; soil chemistry; soil property; spatial distribution; standardization; Brazil","","","This work was partially funded by the São Paulo Research Foundation ( FAPESP ; grant number 2011/04232-8 ) through a master’s scholarship to the first author; and Funding Authority for Studies and Projects (FINEP; public call MCT/FINEP/CT-AGRO - Precision Agriculture −01/2008, grant number 01.08.0566.00 ).","Ackerson, Jason P., Predicting clay content on field-moist intact tropical soils using a dried, ground VisNIR library with external parameter orthogonalization, Geoderma, 259-260, pp. 196-204, (2015); Ackerson, Jason P., Penetrometer-mounted VisNIR spectroscopy: Application of EPO-PLS to in situ VisNIR spectra, Geoderma, 286, pp. 131-138, (2017); Adamchuk, Viacheslav I., On-the-go soil sensors for precision agriculture, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 44, 1, pp. 71-91, (2004); Barnes, Ralph J., Standard normal variate transformation and de-trending of near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectra, Applied Spectroscopy, 43, 5, pp. 772-777, (1989); Bartholomeus, Harm M., Soil Organic Carbon mapping of partially vegetated agricultural fields with imaging spectroscopy, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 13, 1, pp. 81-88, (2011); Hyperspec A Package to Handle Hyperspectral Data Sets in R, (2015); Bellon-Maurel, Veronique, Critical review of chemometric indicators commonly used for assessing the quality of the prediction of soil attributes by NIR spectroscopy, TrAC - Trends in Analytical Chemistry, 29, 9, pp. 1073-1081, (2010); Ben-Dor, Eyal, Remote sensing of soil in the optical domains, pp. 733-787, (2015); Bezdek, Jim C., FCM: The fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, Computers and Geosciences, 10, 2-3, pp. 191-203, (1984); Rgdal Bindings for the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, (2016)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01671987","","SOTRD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034774333"

While spatially granular yield mapping is readily available in machine-harvested row crops, it is more difficult in hand-picked row crops. We study here a data set collected during harvesting of strawberries; using smartphones, we collected Global Positioning System (GPS) logs of individual harvesters. Using recent advances in feature identification, we are able to algorithmically decompose the path into individual excursions into the field to harvest the berries. This lays the groundwork for yield mapping. To further develop this area, we recommend that Resource Managers: Pursue wider scale trials of geolocated harvest data collection of hand-picked crops.

An ISOBlue unit (open-source telematics) was used to record CAN messages pertaining to baling of large round bales which included time, Global Positioning System (GPS) Coordinates (hence speed), fuel consumption rate, engine load, and engine speed. The change in power requirement (a combination of PTO load, rolling resistance, and elevation change) was used to infer the rate of forage accumulation across the field. Post-processing of the data also included analysis of elevation data which was obtained from the CKT Tracker App. The data was processed using Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB), ArcMap, and MS Excel. Of the ten test bales produced, an increase in power requirement due to increased accumulation of mass in the baling chamber was only visible for three of the bales. Within the datasets of these three bales, the increase in power requirement was not consistent enough to determine the yield of the crop across the field, given the data collected. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Machinery; Data; Forage; Isobus; Open Source; Precision Agriculture; Agricultural Machinery; Agriculture; Engines; Global Positioning System; Lawn Mowers; Matlab; Open Systems; Precision Agriculture; Wireless Telecommunication Systems; Consumption Rates; Data; Forage; Fuel Consumption Rates; Isobus; Matrix Laboratories; Open Sources; Power Requirement; Data Handling","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Engines; Global positioning system; Lawn mowers; MATLAB; Open systems; Precision agriculture; Wireless telecommunication systems; Consumption rates; Data; Forage; Fuel consumption rates; ISOBUS; Matrix Laboratories; Open sources; Power requirement; Data handling","","","","Agricultural Machinery Management Data, (2006); Asabe Ep496 2 Agricultural Machinery Management, (1999); Off Road Vehicle Engineering Principles, (2003); Louisiana Marine Education Resources; Controller Area Network can Bus J1939 Data Acquisition Methods and Parameter Accuracy Assessment Using Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory Data, (2015); Agricultural Equipment Technology Conference, (1999); Wang, Yang, An open-source infrastructure for real-time automatic agricultural machine data processing, (2017); Zhang, Naiqian, Precision agriculture - A worldwide overview, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 36, 2-3, pp. 113-132, (2002); GPS Data Visualization and Analysis Workspace, (2017)","","American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers 2950 Niles Road St. Joseph MI 49085-9659","American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)","ASABE 2018 Annual International Meeting","","Detroit; MI; Cobo Center","139340","","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054163050"

To implement management strategies for the control of these species, agriculturalists need information on areas affected by pigweeds. Geographic information systems (GIS) afford users the ability to evaluate agricultural issues at local, county, state, national, and global levels. Also, they allow users to combine different layers of geographic information to help them develop strategic plans to solve problems. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in testing free and open-source GIS software for weed surveys. In this study, the free and open-source software QGIS was used to develop a geographic information database showing the distribution of pigweeds at the county level in the southeastern United States. The maps focused on the following pigweeds: Palmer amaranth, redroot pigweed, and tall waterhemp. Cultivated areas and glyphosate-resistant (GR) pigweed data were added to the GIS database. Database queries were used to demonstrate applications of the GIS for precision agriculture applications at the county level, such as tallying the number of counties affected by the pigweeds, identifying counties reporting GR pigweed, and identifying cultivated areas located in counties with GR pigweeds. This research demonstrated that free and open-source software such as QGIS has strong potential as a decision support tool, with implications for precision weed management at the county scale.

Multi-decadal remote sensing datasets at the petabyte scale are now available in commercial clouds, with new satellite constellations generating petabytes/year of daily high-resolution global coverage imagery. The data analysis capability, however, has lagged behind storage and compute developments, and has traditionally focused on individual scene processing. We present results from an ongoing effort to develop satellite imagery analysis tools that aggregate temporal, spatial, and spectral information and can scale with the high-rate and dimensionality of imagery being collected. We investigate and compare the performance of pixel-level crop identification using tree-based classifiers and its dependence on both temporal and spectral features. Classification performance is assessed using as ground-truth Cropland Data Layer (CDL) crop masks generated by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The CDL maps contain 30m spatial resolution, pixel-level labels for around 200 categories of land cover, but are however only available post-growing season. The analysis focuses on McCook county in South Dakota and shows crop classification using a temporal stack of Landsat 8 (L8) imagery over the growing season, from April through October. Specifically, we consider the temporal L8 stack depth, as well as different normalized band difference indices, and evaluate their contribution to crop identification. We also show an extension of our algorithm to map corn and soy crops in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crop Classification; Landsat 8 Classification; Multispectral Classification; Normalized Band Difference Index Classification; Precision Agriculture.; Temporal Imagery Stacks; Agriculture; Crops; Digital Storage; Image Analysis; Image Classification; Pixels; Remote Sensing; Satellites; Crop Classification; Landsat; Multispectral Classification; Precision Agriculture; Temporal Imagery Stacks; Satellite Imagery","Agriculture; Crops; Digital storage; Image analysis; Image classification; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellites; Crop classification; LANDSAT; Multispectral classification; Precision Agriculture; Temporal imagery stacks; Satellite imagery","","","","Brumby, Steven P., Large-scale functional models of visual cortex for remote sensing, (2009); Digitalglobe, (2014); Planetlabs, (2015); European Space Agency, (2017); Moody, Daniela I., Land cover classification in multispectral imagery using clustering of sparse approximations over learned feature dictionaries, Journal of Applied Remote Sensing, 8, 1, (2014); Moody, Daniela I., Land cover classification in fused multisensor multispectral satellite imagery, Proceedings of the IEEE Southwest Symposium on Image Analysis and Interpretation, 2016-April, pp. 85-88, (2016); Warren, Michael S., Seeing the Earth in the Cloud: Processing one petabyte of satellite imagery in one day, (2016); Cropscape Cropland Data Layer; USDA Fas; Global Land Cover Map for 2009 Globcover 2009, (2012)","Messinger, D.W.; Velez-Reyes, M.","SPIE spie@spie.org","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","23rd SPIE Conference Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral, and Ultraspectral Imagery 2017","","Anaheim; CA","127965","0277786X; 1996756X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510693302; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081; 9781510688728; 9781510688629; 9781510692671; 9781510693326","PSISD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020241464"

We examine maize and soybean yields for 2000-2015 in the Midwestern U.S. using a new satellite-based dataset on crop yields at 30m resolution. We quantify heterogeneity both within and between fields, and find that the difference between average and top yielding fields is typically below 30% for both maize and soybean, as expected in advanced agricultural regions. In most counties, within-field heterogeneity is at least half as large as overall heterogeneity, illustrating the importance of non-management factors such as soil and landscape position. Surprisingly, we find that yield heterogeneity is rising in maize, both between and within fields, with average yield differences between the best and worst soils more than doubling since 2000. Heterogeneity trends were insignificant for soybean. The findings are consistent both with recent adoption of precision agriculture technologies and with recent trends toward denser sowing in maize, which disproportionately raise yields on better soils. The results imply that yield gains in the region are increasingly derived from the more productive land, and that sub-field precision management of nutrients and other inputs is increasingly warranted. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crops; Remote Sensing; Yield Gaps; Crops; Food Supply; Land Use; Remote Sensing; Average Yield; Landscape Positions; Management Factors; New Satellites; Precision Agriculture Technology; Recent Trends; Satellite Detection; Yield Gaps; Soils; Agricultural Land; Agricultural Production; Agricultural Technology; Crop Yield; Food Supply; Land Use; Maize; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Satellite Data; Soybean; Yield Response; Midwest; United States; Glycine Max; Zea Mays","Crops; Food supply; Land use; Remote sensing; Average yield; Landscape positions; Management factors; New satellites; Precision agriculture technology; Recent trends; Satellite detection; yield gaps; Soils; agricultural land; agricultural production; agricultural technology; crop yield; food supply; land use; maize; precision agriculture; remote sensing; satellite data; soybean; yield response; Midwest; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays","","","","Remote Sens Environ, (2016); Boryan, Claire G., Monitoring US agriculture: The US department of agriculture, national agricultural statistics service, cropland data layer program, Geocarto International, 26, 5, pp. 341-358, (2011); Brandes, Elke, Subfield profitability analysis reveals an economic case for cropland diversification, Environmental Research Letters, 11, 1, (2016); Duvick, Donald N., The Contribution of Breeding to Yield Advances in maize (Zea mays L.), Advances in Agronomy, 86, pp. 83-145, (2005); undefined, (2015); Farmaha, Bhupinder Singh, Contribution of persistent factors to yield gaps in high-yield irrigated maize, Field Crops Research, 186, pp. 124-132, (2016); Crop Yields and Global Food Security Will Yield Increase Continue to Feed the World, (2014); Gitelson, Anatoly A., Remote estimation of leaf area index and green leaf biomass in maize canopies, Geophysical Research Letters, 30, 5, pp. 1-52, (2003); J Agric Sci, (2016); Grassini, Patricio, Distinguishing between yield advances and yield plateaus in historical crop production trends, Nature Communications, 4, (2013)","","Institute of Physics Publishing helen.craven@iop.org","","","","","","17489326","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011396320"

Honey bees are a vital part of the food chain as the most important pollinator for a wide range of crops. It is clear that protecting the population of honey bees worldwide, as well as enabling them to maximise their productivity, is an important concern. In this paper heterogeneous wireless sensor networks are utilised to collect data on a range of parameters from a beehive with the aim of accurately describing the internal conditions and colony activity. The parameters measured were: CO<inf>2</inf>, O<inf>2</inf>, pollutant gases, temperature, relative humidity, and acceleration. Weather data (sunshine, rain, and temperature) were also collected to provide an additional analysis dimension. Using a data set from a deployment at a field-deployed beehive, a biological analysis was undertaken to classify ten important hive states. This classification led to the development of a decision tree based classification algorithm which could describe the beehive using sensor network data with 95.38% accuracy. Finally, a correlation between meteorological conditions and beehive data was observed. This led to the development of an algorithm for predicting short term rain based on the parameters within the hive. Envisioned applications of this algorithm include agricultural and environmental monitoring for short term local forecasts (95.4% accuracy). Experimental results shows the low computational and energy overhead (5.35% increase in energy consumption) of the classification algorithm when deployed on one network node, which allows the node to be a self-sustainable intelligent device for smart bee hives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision Tree Analysis; Honey Bee Monitoring; Internet Of Things (iot); Precision Agriculture; Precision Apiculture; Wireless Sensor Networks (wsn); Agriculture; Algorithms; Carbon Dioxide; Classification (of Information); Data Mining; Decision Trees; Energy Utilization; Food Products; Food Supply; Rain; Sensor Nodes; Trees (mathematics); Decision Tree Analysis; Honey Bee; Internet Of Things (iot); Precision Agriculture; Precision Apiculture; Wireless Sensor Networks; Agrometeorology; Algorithm; Apiculture; Biological Analysis; Data Set; Decision Support System; Environmental Monitoring; Health Monitoring; Honeybee; Pollinator; Pollutant Source; Precision Agriculture; Sensor; United Nations; World Wide Web; Apis Mellifera; Apoidea","Agriculture; Algorithms; Carbon dioxide; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Energy utilization; Food products; Food supply; Rain; Sensor nodes; Trees (mathematics); Decision tree analysis; Honey bee; Internet of Things (IOT); Precision Agriculture; Precision apiculture; Wireless sensor networks; agrometeorology; algorithm; apiculture; biological analysis; data set; decision support system; environmental monitoring; health monitoring; honeybee; pollinator; pollutant source; precision agriculture; sensor; United Nations; World Wide Web; Apis mellifera; Apoidea","","","The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge funding provided by the Irish Research Council under their Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship 2014 .

However, emerging high volume markets, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), precision agriculture or robotic guidance systems, require high precision performance that is both energy-efficient and low cost. This paper focuses on the challenges associated with designing and implementing a very precise RTK-based module solution while keeping cost, size, and power consumption as low as possible. In particular, several implementation strategies such as multi-constellation support or single frequency ambiguity resolution are discussed in light of hardware limitations and computational complexity. Following this discussion, the u-blox end-to-end L1 RTK solution, which comprises the NEO-M8P rover and reference modules, is presented. To demonstrate the ability of these modules to achieve cm-level accuracy while meeting the requirements of mass-market applications, several measurement campaigns were conducted. The accuracy of the u-blox NEO-M8P was evaluated under a wide range of signal environments and receiver dynamics. Several walk and UAV data sets were used to benchmark the performance of the NEO-M8P modules against existing L1 RTK products. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Navigation; Benchmarking; Commerce; Costs; Energy Efficiency; Signal Receivers; Transportation; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Centimeter Levels; Implementation Strategies; Mass-market Applications; Measurement Campaign; Precision Agriculture; Real Time Kinematic; Robotic Guidance; Signal Environment; Global Positioning System","Air navigation; Benchmarking; Commerce; Costs; Energy efficiency; Signal receivers; Transportation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Centimeter levels; Implementation strategies; Mass-market applications; Measurement campaign; Precision Agriculture; Real time kinematic; Robotic guidance; Signal environment; Global positioning system","","","","Counselman, Charles C., Miniature Interferometer Terminals for Earth Surveying: Ambiguity and Multipath with Global Positioning System, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, GE-19, 4, pp. 244-252, (1981); Proc 3 Int Geodetic Sym Satellite Doppler Positionining, (1982); Proceedings of Ion GPS 1999 September 14 17 Nashville Tn, (1999); Julien, Olivier Jean, Improved triple-frequency GPS/GALILEO carrier phase ambiguity resolution using a stochastic ionosphere modeling, Proceedings of the National Technical Meeting, Institute of Navigation, 2004, pp. 441-452, (2004); Proceedings of the 12th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation Ion Gnss 1999, (1999); Keong, Jiunhan H., Heading and Pitch Determination Using GPS/GLONASS, GPS Solutions, 3, 3, pp. 26-36, (2000); Proc on China Satellite Navigation Conference, (2013); International Journal of Navigation and Observation, (2009); Odolinski, Robert, Combined GPS and BeiDou instantaneous RTK positioning, Navigation, Journal of the Institute of Navigation, 61, 2, pp. 135-148, (2014); Ong, Richard B., Assessment of GPS/GLONASS RTK under various operational conditions, 6, pp. 3767-3778, (2009)","","Institute of Navigation","","29th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS 2016","","Portland; OR; Oregon Convention Center","126930","","9781510834101; 9781510817258","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017307104"

The kinematic model is comprised of a site velocity model (for coordinate prediction and to model inter-seismic deformation and plate motion) and an epoch correction (patch) model. The epoch correction model estimates distortion between reference frames at the reference epoch and can include episodic deformation arising from seismic activity. The kinematic model presented enables seamless interaction between precision GNSS positioning and related systems, GIS and static spatial datasets within a kinematic coordinate environment with centimetre precision. The next generation Australian Geodetic Datum will be realised within a kinematic reference frame in order to capture the highest resolution deformation of the Australian tectonic plate. This represents a paradigm shift from classical geodetic datums which are realised by coordinates of geodetic monuments fixed at a specified reference epoch (static geodetic datums). Centimetre precision positioning will be available to the mass market in the near future and the disparity between static geodetic datums (and spatial data products derived from them) and ITRF due to the effects of Earth deformation will be become more apparent. As development of deformation models within GIS is still in its infancy, there is still an ongoing requirement to provide static coordinates to users to enable positioning within a kinematic reference frame to maintain alignment with existing spatial datasets (e.g., cadastral, utilities, roads, infrastructure, mining, precision agriculture, imagery and LiDar). Furthermore, a four-dimensional GIS, when developed, will still require a precise deformation or kinematic model to enable spatial data collected at different epochs to be integrated harmoniously. The current strategy used in Australia to transform between a specified epoch of ITRF and GDA94 (the current ITRF aligned geodetic datum fixed at epoch 1994.0) is to use a 14 parameter conformal transformation but approach does not capture the full complexity and variation of the deformation field at the highest resolution for some users, and so a variable resolution gridded deformation model is proposed here as an alternative. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deformationmodel; Gnss; Kinematic Datum; Reference Frame; Conformal Mapping; Deformation; Geodesy; Global Positioning System; Metadata; Seismology; Conformal Transformation; Deformation Modeling; Deformationmodel; Gnss; Kinematic Data; Precision Agriculture; Precision Positioning; Reference Frame; Kinematics","Conformal mapping; Deformation; Geodesy; Global positioning system; Metadata; Seismology; Conformal transformation; Deformation modeling; DeformationModel; GNSS; Kinematic data; Precision Agriculture; Precision positioning; Reference frame; Kinematics","","","","Altamimi, Zuheir, ITRF2008 plate motion model, Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, 117, 7, (2012); Braun, Jean, Constraints on the current rate of deformation and surface uplift of the Australian continent from a new seismic database and low-T thermochronological data, Australian Journal of Earth Sciences, 56, 2, pp. 99-110, (2009); Comlaw National Measurement Act 1960 Recognized Value Standard of Measurement of Position, (2012); Geoscience Australia Auspos Online GPS Processing Service, (2013); Updating the Nzgd2000 Deformation Model Proceedings of the 125th Annual Conference of the New Zealand Institute of Surveyors Nzis, (2013); Bernese GPS Software Version 5 0, (2007); Dawson, John H., ITRF to GDA94 coordinate transformations, Journal of Applied Geodesy, 4, 4, pp. 189-199, (2010); Apref Network Solution, (2013); Surfer 11, (2013); National Geodetic Survey Ngs Opus Online Positioning User Service, (2013)","Rizos, C.; Willis, P.","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","150th Anniversary with a Scientific Assembly, IAG 2013","","Potsdam","179869","21979359; 09399585","9783319456287; 9783319108360; 9783030542665; 9783540493495; 9783540854258; 9783319398198; 9783319245485; 9783642372216; 9783031259012; 9783319108278","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84984910832"

In addition, some crops such as corn, which is the most produced grain in the world, is used as food, feed, bio-energy and other industrial purposes. Thus, it is needed the development of new technologies that make possible to produce more from less land. In particular, the corn crop is sensitive to its spatial arrangement and any variation in plant distribution pattern can lead to reduction in corn production. Nowadays, the uniformity of the plant spacing is checked manually by agronomists in order to predict possible production losses. In this context, this work proposes an automatic approach for measuring the spacing between corn plants in the early stages of growth. The proposed approach is based on computer vision techniques in order to evaluate the automatic inter-plant spacing measurement from images in a simple and efficient way, allowing its use on devices with low computational power such as smart phones and tablets. An image dataset was built as an additional contribution of this work containing 2186 corn plants in two conditions: tillage after the application of herbicide (TH) with 1387 corn plants and conventional tillage (CT) with 799 corn plants. The dataset is available at url: http://github.com/Brilhador/cornspacing. The experimental results achieve 90% of precision and 92% of sensitivity in corn plant identification. Regarding the automatic measurement of the interplant spacing, the results showed no significant differences from the same measurements taken manually, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in two distinct types of planting. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer Vision; Image Processing; Inter-plant Spacing; Pattern Recognition; Precision Agriculture; Agricultural Machinery; Computer Vision; Computerized Tomography; Crops; Image Processing; Pattern Recognition; Plants (botany); Smartphones; Automatic Approaches; Automatic Measurements; Computer Vision Techniques; Conventional Tillage; Plant Distribution Patterns; Plant Spacing; Precision Agriculture; Spatial Arrangements; Agriculture","Agricultural machinery; Computer vision; Computerized tomography; Crops; Image processing; Pattern recognition; Plants (botany); Smartphones; Automatic approaches; Automatic measurements; Computer vision techniques; Conventional tillage; Plant distribution patterns; Plant spacing; Precision Agriculture; Spatial arrangements; Agriculture","","","This work was supported by CNPq, Fund.
