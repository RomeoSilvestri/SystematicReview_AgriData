Singh,2024,"Image fusion could adopt the optical and microwave images model to obtain more precise agricultural land cover information features by using the optical and microwave remote sensing sensors characteristics. The source of data has decided to take into account Sentinel-2 L2A and Sentinel-1 VH (Vertical-transmit and Horizontal-receive) datasets for testing image fusion classifiers used in the experiments. Different kinds of classifiers were used in this research. Among them, MDC stands for Minimum Distance Classifier, and Maximum Likelihood Classifier represents MLC. Lastly, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used during the fusion of the images to classify Land Use and determine the validity of these algorithms. A summary of the outputs will give an upper hand to the classifiers based on Support Vector Machines, with the accuracy reaching 95.67% and a kappa of 0.9191. The SVM classification algorithm during the study showed the dense vegetation, deciduous vegetation, water, and urban zones with shallow errors. MDC performed the task well in detecting the land use category with an accuracy of 91.70% and kappa of 0.8469. The opposite of the MDC classifier was that the accuracy was not the top level, as, in some ways, some water bodies were wrongly assigned as urban regions. MLC has the least promising result among other approaches and is in the last place in terms of accuracy, with 89.52% and a kappa value of 0.8281.",no,"The data sources mentioned (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) are global, and the abstract does not specify an exclusively European study area.",

In regions where TCA is deemed unreliable, we use correlation significance levels ( $p$ -values) as indicator for retrieval quality to decide whether to use active data only, passive data only, or an unweighted average. We apply the proposed merging scheme to active retrievals from advanced scatterometer and passive retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer—Earth Observing System using Global Land Data Assimilation System-Noah to complement the triplet required for TCA.

Wu; B. Xu; X. Yang; H. Feng; G. Yang,2024,"The accurate and high-throughput extraction of phenotypic traits is of great significance for crop breeding and growth monitoring. The segmentation of structural components (e.g., leaves and stems) is a prerequisite for extracting phenotypic traits. In the past decade, there has been an increase in methods attempting to separate leaves and stems in point clouds. However, previous researches mainly focus on plants at the individual level due to the interlocked and overlapped nature of leaves and the bottleneck existing for field plants to extract phenotypic traits. To address this issue, a novel two-stage leaf–stem separation model encompassing the initial separation of leaves and stems and optimization is presented in this article. The model is based on the different geometric features of leaves and stems of maize plants defined by neighborhood points, and a cylinder is used to find the neighborhood points by considering the elongated characteristic of maize stems. After that, another elongated cylinder (0.5 m high and 0.02 m diameter) is used to traverse the stem points to optimize the initially separated results. Maize plants with the planting density of 45 000 plants/ha in the filling stage (Exp. 2019) were used to train and test the model in the initial separation step (Experiment 1), showing that the separation accuracy (SA) could be up to 91.3%. It was concluded that a 0.11-m-high and 0.07-m diameter cylinder was the optimal searching parameter for the initial separation and 0.25 m was the optimal threshold for optimization. We also tested the transferability of the model (Experiment 2) for maize plants with different planting densities (45 000, 67 500, 90 000, and 105 000 plants/ha), different growth stages (jointing, silking and filling), and point clouds collected using multiple platforms [terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), light detection and ranging (LiDAR) Backpack (LiBackpack), and unmanned aerial vehicle-LiDAR (UAV-LiDAR)], suggesting that the model performed well for all the datasets. In addition, the simulated datasets of maize with different planting densities were used to assess the model performance at the point level, showing the SA values were 0.92, 0.91, 0.91, and 0.90 for maize with the planting densities of 45 000, 67 500, 90 000, and 105 000 plants/ha, respectively.

Rodríguez-Fernández; R. van der Schalie; T. Scanlon; A. Al Bitar; Y. H. Kerr; R. de Jeu; W. Dorigo,2022,"Building climate data records of soil moisture (SM) requires computing long time series by merging retrievals from sensors on-board different satellites, which implies to perform a bias correction or rescaling on the original time series. Due to their long time span and high temporal frequency, model data could be used as a common reference for the rescaling. However, avoiding model dependence in observational climate data records is needed for some applications. In this article, the possibility of using as reference remote sensing data from one of the $L$-band sensors specifically designed to measure SM is discussed. Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 SM time series were rescaled by matching their cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) to those of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) NOAH model time series. The CDF computation was investigated as a function of the time series length, finding significant differences from four to nine years. Replacing temporal by spatial variance does not allow us to compute better CDFs from short time series. The rescaled time series show a high correlation ($R>0.8$) to the original ones and a low bias with respect to the reference ($< $0.03 m $^{3}\cdot$ m$^{-3}$). The time series rescaled using several SMOS or SMAP datasets were also evaluated against in situ measurements and show performances similar to or slightly better than those rescaled using the model GLDAS.

Garlando,2024,"Food security, producing enough food for every person on the planet, is becoming a significant issue. Increasing world population and climate change are setting new challenges to food production. Water stress can cause severe damage to crops, and detecting and preventing this threat is crucial. Smart agriculture and the use of sensors directly on the field is a promising and rapidly evolving solution. Data collected by a large number of sensors must be analyzed and efficiently interpreted. In this context, machine learning is an effective solution. This article conducts a comparative analysis of several well-established machine learning models, all trained on a dataset enriched with a novel parameter for the assessment of plant health, the stem electrical impedance (modulus and phase). This feature gives promising results since it is a direct parameter of the plant itself. Moreover, the inclusion of the stem impedance parameter significantly boosted the model's performance, notably enhancing the effectiveness, particularly evident in the case of the top-performing model in this study, the random forest algorithm. When incorporating stem electrical impedance, this model achieved an impressive F1 score of 98%, markedly surpassing the 88% obtained in its absence. As a complementary analysis, a permutation feature performance analysis was conducted, highlighting the potential of stem impedance modulus as a promising feature for evaluating plant watering conditions. The removal of impedance modulus from the training model resulted in an average classification performance loss of 25% in terms of F1 score, suggesting how impedance monitoring is a promising approach for plant health management.",maybe,"The abstract mentions using a dataset for training machine learning models in an agricultural context, but it does not specify the geographical coverage of the data.",

Kamienski,2020,"In smart agriculture, the Internet of Things (IoT) makes it possible to analyze and manage agricultural yield to increase productivity, reduce wasted resources, and decrease irrigation costs. In IoT systems, if data management is entirely performed in the cloud, the system may not work correctly due to connectivity problems, which is common in some remote regions where the agribusiness thrives. A fog computing solution enables the IoT system to process data faster and deal with intermittent connectivity. However, a high number of packets sent from the fog to the cloud can cause link congestion with mostly useless data traffic. Dealing with fog data filtering is a challenge because it requires knowing which data is essential to send to the cloud. This paper proposes an approach to collect and store data in a smart agriculture environment and two different methods filtering data in the fog. We designed an experiment for each filtering method, using a real dataset containing temperature and humidity values. In both experiments, the fog filters the data using the k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) algorithm, which classifies data into categories according to their value ranges. In the first experiment, the fog classifies the data and generates an output of the number of data categories. In the second experiment, data is classified and also compressed based on the previously obtained categories using the runlength encoding (RLE) technique to preserve the data time series nature. Our results show that data filtering reduces the amount of data sent by the fog to the cloud.",maybe,"The abstract mentions using a real dataset for smart agriculture, but the geographical coverage of this dataset is not specified.",

Tabik,2024,"The availability of high-resolution satellite images has accelerated the creation of new datasets designed to tackle broader remote sensing (RS) problems. Although popular tasks, such as scene classification, have received significant attention, the recent release of the Land-1.0 RS dataset marks the initiation of endeavors to estimate land-use and land-cover (LULC) fraction values per RGB satellite image. This challenging problem involves estimating LULC composition, i.e., the proportion of different LULC classes from satellite imagery, with major applications in environmental monitoring, agricultural/urban planning, and climate change studies. Currently, supervised deep learning models—the state-of-the-art in image classification—require large volumes of labeled training data to provide good generalization. To face the challenges posed by the scarcity of labeled RS data, self-supervised learning (SSL) models have recently emerged, learning directly from unlabeled data by leveraging the underlying structure. This is the first article to investigate the performance of SSL in LULC fraction estimation on RGB satellite patches using in-domain knowledge.

In this letter, the applicability of three snow density datasets, including European ReAnalysis (ERA)-Interim, ERA5, and the newly released ERA5-Land datasets, was first assessed using two ground evaluation datasets with different land covers from seven snow survey courses and four densely sampled networks in China. The results show that the ERA-Interim dataset significantly overestimates snow density during the entire snow season, with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) larger than 112 kg/m3, and lacks temporal dynamics. The ERA5 and ERA5-Land datasets are generally in good agreement with the ground measurements in China.

The objective of this letter was to determine the surface roughness sample size required in synthetic aperture radar applications and to provide some guidelines on roughness characterization in agricultural soils for these applications. With this aim, a data set consisting of ten ENVISAT/ASAR observations acquired coinciding with soil moisture and surface roughness surveys has been processed. The analysis consisted of: 1) assessing the accuracies of roughness parameters s and l depending on the number of 1-m-long profiles measured per field; 2) computing the correlation of field average roughness parameters with backscatter observations; and 3) evaluating the goodness of fit of three widely used backscatter models, i.e., integral equation model (IEM), geometrical optics model (GOM), and Oh model. The results obtained illustrate a different behavior of the two roughness parameters. A minimum of 10-15 profiles can be considered sufficient for an accurate determination of s, while 20 profiles might still be not enough for accurately estimating l. The correlation analysis revealed a clear sensitivity of backscatter to surface roughness. For sample sizes >15 profiles, R values were as high as 0.6 for s and ~0.35 for l, while for smaller sample sizes R values dropped significantly. Similar results were obtained when applying the backscatter models, with enhanced model precision for larger sample sizes.

Schubert,2021,"In this article, we share our experience in the scope of controlled-environment agriculture automation in the Antarctic station greenhouse facility called EDEN ISS. For remote plant monitoring, control, and maintenance, we solve the problem of plant classification. Due to the inherent communication limitations between Antarctica and Europe, we first propose the image compression mechanism for the data collection. We show that we can compress the images, on average, 7.2 times for efficient transmission over the weak channel. Moreover, we prove that decompressed images can be further used for computer vision applications. Upon decompressing images, we apply machine learning for the classification task. We achieve 92.6% accuracy on an 18-classes unbalanced dataset.

Duncan; I. Becker-Reshef,2023,"The war in Ukraine has resulted in significant losses in the agricultural sector due to damages to farmlands posing a threat to global food security. To restore the prosperity of the agricultural sector it is essential to detect and assess damages in agricultural fields and monitor their evolution. Commercial satellite data at very high spatial resolution $(\lt3 \mathrm{~m})$ such as sub-meter imagery acquired by Maxar’s WorldView and Planet Labs’ SkySat platforms allow detection and mapping of artillery craters at fine scale. However, the frequency of acquisition and geographical coverage of this type of data is limited and may be quite low, e.g., 1-2 scenes per agriculture season. With the aim to continuously monitor the state of the fields over large areas in Ukraine we must compliment the analysis with satellite data at lower spatial resolution, e.g., daily PlanetScope at $\sim 3-\mathrm{m}$ and 10-m Sentinel-2/MSI. Here, we propose a data fusion approach to monitor artillery craters in agricultural fields using combination of satellite images acquired at different spatial and temporal resolution. Specifically, we use a single-date SkySat image at 0.5-m resolution with crater detection using previously developed deep learning approach along with multi-temporal data acquired by PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images. For the latter, we detect anomalies of refelecant signal in the blue and green spectral bands and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). This approach is applied to a test area of 8,800 ha in Donetsk oblast. We found that with PlanetScope images at 3-m we were able to identify 202 ha of craters, or 63% of those in SkySat imagery; with Sentinel-2 at 10-m we detected 165 ha (or 51%) of craters. Craters with an area smaller than $100 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ were poorly detected. By analyzing anomalies in multi-temporal PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images, we were able to identify craters that were not detected in SkySat data highlighting the importance of temporal component in the data. Furthermore, with daily PlanetScope data combined with Sentinel-2 data (3-5 days), we were able to estimate the dates of crater appearances and analyze the dynamics of craters and their evolution.",no,"The study focuses on Ukraine, which is national coverage and therefore excluded.",

In this study, a combined approach based on the use of multispectral imagery, acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, and statistical models was applied for determining the water status of a citrus orchard during different phenological stages, with respect to traditional stem water potential (SWP) measurements. Specifically, the suitability of individual spectral bands and vegetation indices was firstly evaluated, followed by the implementation of statistical methods (i.e., stepwise linear regression models and principal component regression) using the UAV information as explanatory variables. The results showed a weak correlation between the spectral bands and the SWP during the fruit rapid growth stage. A stronger relationship was observed instead when the vegetation indices were used, during the same phenological stage, but with low Pearson coefficients of correlation, varying from -0.31 to -0.46. The SWP estimated by the statistical methods resulted more reliable, with average mean absolute error, root mean square error and percent bias values ranging from 0.17 to 0.19 MPa, from 0.23 to 0.24 MPa and from -0.38 to -0.59%, respectively.

This study proposes a novel approach for classifying different irrigation systems at field level by using remotely sensed data at subfield scale as inputs of different supervised machine learning (ML) models for time-series classification. The ML models were trained using ground-truth data from more than 300 fields collected during a field campaign in 2020 across an intensely cultivated region in Catalunya, Spain. Two hydrological variables retrieved from satellite data, actual evapotranspiration ($ET_{a}$) and soil moisture ($SM$), showed the best results when used for classification, especially when combined together, retrieving a final accuracy of $90.1 \pm 2.7\%$. All the three ML models employed for the classification showed that they were able to distinguish different irrigation systems, regardless of the different crops present in each field.

Traditional methodologies such as the Canny-Watershed (CW) algorithm require expert tuning of parameters for optimal results. This paper introduces an innovative approach for crop field segmentation in high-resolution satellite images, leveraging the use of multi-temporal Canny edge detection to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully automate the segmentation process. The Canny filter, applied to Sentinel-2 multi-temporal data, provides refined input for training ResUnet models, facilitating the generation of a generalized training dataset. ResUnet allows the model to learn complex features from diverse data, encapsulating seasonal changes. The dataset was specifically designed to enable the model to make accurate predictions from a single image, significantly outperforming traditional Canny filter predictions. In addition, the ResUnet may be applied to multiple images, generating output masks that, when overlayed, produce better results with respect to the multi-temporal Canny approach, demonstrating superior ability in recognizing real field boundaries while reducing false detections.To enhance generalizability, ResUnet is trained on a varied global dataset capturing a wide range of agricultural conditions and seasonal variations.

Among them is the systematic classification of land cover types based on the patterns of settlements or agriculture recorded by SAR imagers, in particular the identification and quantification of temporal changes. A systematic (re)classification shall allow the assignment of continuously updated semantic content labels to local image patches. This necessitates a careful selection of well-defined and discernible categories being contained in the image data that have to be trained and validated. These steps are well-established for optical images, while the peculiar imaging characteristics of SAR sensors often prevent a comparable approach. Especially, the vast range of SAR imaging parameters and the diversity of local targets impact the image product characteristics and need special care. In the following, we present guidelines and practical examples of how to obtain reliable image patch classification results for time series data with a limited number of given training data. We demonstrate that one can avoid the generation of simulated training data if we decompose the classification task into physically meaningful subsets of characteristic target properties and important imaging parameters. Then, the results obtained during training can serve as benchmarking figures for subsequent image classification. This holds for typical remote sensing examples such as coastal monitoring or the characterization of urban areas where we want to understand the transitions between individual land cover categories.

However, crop-damaging pests compromise yields, jeopardizing the benefits of PA. Computer vision-based pest detection techniques offer promising avenues to overcome potential losses for farmers. The recent object detection framework, YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) applied to real-time insect monitoring is an open-source, cutting-edge PA approach based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that enables precise and quick decision making in agricultural crops.

Tauqir; P. Tarolli,2024,"In the face of rapid global climate change and the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events, acquiring seamless land surface temperature (LST) with high spatial and temporal resolution on a global scale has become increasingly crucial. However, the limited ability of thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing to penetrate cloud cover has hindered the widespread application of TIR LST datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel reconstruction approach for cloud-covered pixels, which is established based on the annual surface temperature cycle. It shifted the previous reconstruction from directly modeling LST to indirectly modeling the residual term derived from the LST observations and the annual temperature cycle (ATC) model fit values. A random forest regression (RFR) was used to build this estimation model and the model was applied to cloud-covered pixels to derive their LSTs. Taking the Iberian Peninsula as the study area, the proposed method was applied to generate the all-weather LST product for the whole year 2021. The visual assessment demonstrates its robust performance across different seasons and weather conditions. Additionally, through the validation with the masked clear-sky LST observations, it reveals that the proposed method achieves a stable estimation accuracy, with the average value of the coefficient of determination ( ${R} ^{2}$ ) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of above 0.8 and 1.08 K under different climatic conditions. In comparison, the validation with the ERA-5 land reanalysis data also indicates a relatively good consistency between the performance of the reconstructed LST and the clear-sky LST, although with a slight decline in  ${R} ^{2}$  and RMSE. Additionally, the indirect validation with near-surface air temperature (NSAT) also shows the comparable ability of the reconstructed LST in NSAT estimation as the clear-sky LST, with an increase of RMSE no more than 0.95 K. In general, the proposed method shows good potential in reconstructing cloud-covered LSTs with relatively stable performance under different cloud-cover conditions and it can be applied for generating all-weather LST products.",yes,"The paper uses MODIS and ERA-5 data for the Iberian Peninsula, which covers multiple European countries and meets all inclusion criteria.",MODIS; ERA-5

Verhoest,2017,"Soil surface roughness strongly affects the scattering of microwaves on the soil surface and determines the backscattering coefficient (σ0) observed by radar sensors. Previous studies have shown important scale issues that compromise the measurement and parameterization of roughness especially in agricultural soils. The objective of this paper was to determine the roughness scales involved in the backscattering process over agricultural soils. With this aim, a database of 132 5-m profiles taken on agricultural soils with different tillage conditions was used. These measurements were acquired coinciding with a series of ENVISAT/ASAR observations. Roughness profiles were processed considering three different scaling issues: 1) influence of measurement range; 2) influence of low-frequency roughness components; and 3) influence of high-frequency roughness components. For each of these issues, eight different roughness parameters were computed and the following aspects were evaluated: 1) roughness parameters values; 2) correlation with σ0; and 3) goodness-of-fit of the Oh model. Most parameters had a significant correlation with σ0 especially the fractal dimension, the peak frequency, and the initial slope of the autocorrelation function. These parameters had higher correlations than classical parameters such as the standard deviation of surface heights or the correlation length. Very small differences were observed when longer than 1-m profiles were used as well as when small-scale roughness components (<;5 cm) or large-scale roughness components (>100 cm) were disregarded. In conclusion, the medium-frequency roughness components (scale of 5-100 cm) seem to be the most influential scales in the radar backscattering process on agricultural soils.",no,"The abstract describes a database of soil profiles but does not specify its geographic location or coverage.

To identify different levels of fire severity without using fixed thresholds, we applied SOM to the three spectral indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized burn ratio (NBR), and burned area index for sentinel (BAIS) used to enhance burned areas. This is a particular critical issue because fixed threshold values are generally not suitable for fragmented landscapes, vegetation types, and geographic regions different from those for which they were devised. To cope with this issue, the methodological approach herein proposed is based on three steps: 1) indices computation; 2) maps of the difference of the three indices computed using the data acquired from prefire and postfire occurrences; and 3) unsupervised classification obtained processing all the difference maps using the SOM.

Kumar; A. Bhattacharya; J. M. Lopez-Sanchez,2018,"Feature selection techniques intent to select a subset of features that minimizes redundancy and maximizes relevancy for classification problems in machine learning. Standard methods for feature selection in machine learning seldom take into account the domain knowledge associated with the data. Multitemporal crop classification studies with full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data ought to consider the changes in the scattering mechanisms with their phenological growth stages. Hence, it is desirable to incorporate these changes while determining a feature subset for classification. In this study, a random forest (RF) based feature selection technique is proposed that takes into account the changes in the physical scattering mechanism with crop phenological stages for multitemporal PolSAR classification. The partial probability plot, which is an attribute of RF, provides information about the marginal effect of a polarimetric parameter on the desired crop class. Moreover, it is used to identify the specific range of a parameter where the probability of the presence of a particular crop class is high. The proposed technique identifies features that change significantly with crop phenology. The selected features are the ones whose ranges show maximum separation amongst crop classes. Additionally, the feature subset is refined by eliminating correlated features. The E-SAR L-band dataset of the AgriSAR-2006 campaign over the Demmin test site in Germany is used in this study. The classification accuracy using the novel feature selection technique is 99.12%.

Ballester-Berman,2020,"This article evaluates the effect of the double-bounce (DB) decorrelation term that appears in single-pass bistatic acquisitions, as in the TanDEM-X system, on the inversion of scene parameters by means of polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR). The retrieval of all scene parameters involved in the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model (i.e., ground topography, vegetation height, extinction, and ground-to-volume ratios) is affected by this term when the radar response from the ground is dominated by the DB. The estimation error in all these parameters is analyzed by means of simulations over a wide range of system configurations and scene variables for both agricultural crops and forest scenarios. Simulations demonstrate that the inclusion of the DB term, which complicates the inversion algorithm, is necessary for the angles of incidence shallower than 30° to achieve an estimation error below 10% in vegetation height and to avoid a significant underestimation in the ground-to-volume ratios. At steep incidences, this decorrelation term does not affect the estimation of vegetation height and ground-to-volume ratios. Regarding the extinction, this parameter is intrinsically not well estimated, since most retrieved values are close to the initial guesses employed for the optimization algorithm, regardless of the use or not of the DB decorrelation term.

Sarr,2024,"Enhancing food security in the Sahel through nature-based solutions is urgent given population growth, resource scarcity and climate change. Traditional agroforestry parklands are a farmer- and nature-based widespread form of ecological intensification which randomly integrates trees into crop fields. While most studies estimating crop yields in agroforestry have been conducted in controlled experimental settings, few have addressed the inherent variability in such highly heterogeneous systems. Thus, the purpose of this study is to benefit from a UAV-based proxy-sensing and machine learning approach to address the variability of pearl millet grain yield, according to the distance to randomly distributed trees in a traditional agroforestry system dominated by Faidherbia albida (i.e. groundnut basin of Senegal). 21 vegetation indices (VIs), 32 normalized difference texture indices (NDTIs) derived from multispectral drone images, and normalization variables for radiative conditions were used with yield data collected in 15 plots (around 1 ha each) and subplots ( $15~m^{2} $  each) displayed at 3 distances from the tree over five cropping seasons (2018–2022). In this context, the optimal phenological stage was determined for predicting pearl millet grain yield, which proved to be the pre-heading period. This period was used as the basis for our machine learning model training dataset in the subplots. Two models, Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) were compared by combining VIs, NDTIs and normalization variables. GBM was the best-performing model, explaining 78% of observed pearl millet yield variability over five years in the subplots, with a RMSE of 16 g. $m^{-2} $ . This study revealed that NDTIs calculated from red and green bands were more influential for yield estimation than those based on near-infrared. These results were subsequently used to predict yield in all plots, resulting in a mean relative error of 17.5% between yields estimated by the farmers and GBM-estimated yields.

Solutions vary from physical modeling, and long-term observations, to short-term measurements.

Here, an important aspect that has not been addressed before is where to initially deploy the drifting elements such that the acquired velocity field would efficiently represent the water current. To that end, we use a clustering approach that relies on a physical model of the velocity field. Our method segments the modeled map and determines the deployment locations as those that will lead the floaters to “visit” the center of the different segments. This way, we validate that the area covered by the floaters will capture the inhomogeneity of the velocity field. Exploration over a dataset of velocity field maps that span over a year demonstrates the applicability of our approach, and shows a considerable improvement over the common approach of uniformly randomly choosing the initial deployment sites.

Within retrieval workflows for real-time mapping over agricultural regions, such crop-specific information products need to be derived precisely and rapidly.

The analysis results highlight a clear increasing trend of the environmental footprint with CMOS technology downscaling below  $0.13~\mu \text{m}$ , despite a significant variation between the sources mainly due to scope mismatch. Finally, we show that environmental impacts per cm2 did not significantly decrease compared to historical values from 1980–2010, whereas the total silicon area produced keeps on increasing by 3.6%/year.

Ciarfuglia,2024,"The problem of multi-object tracking (MOT) consists in detecting and tracking all the objects in a video sequence while keeping a unique identifier for each object. It is a challenging and fundamental problem for robotics. In precision agriculture the challenge of achieving a satisfactory solution is amplified by extreme camera motion, sudden illumination changes, and strong occlusions. Most modern trackers rely on the appearance of objects rather than motion for association, which can be ineffective when most targets are static objects with the same appearance, as in the agricultural case. To this end, on the trail of SORT [5], we propose AgriSORT, a simple, online, real-time tracking-by-detection pipeline for precision agriculture based only on motion information that allows for accurate and fast propagation of tracks between frames. The main focuses of AgriSORT are efficiency, flexibility, minimal dependencies, and ease of deployment on robotic platforms. We test the proposed pipeline on a novel MOT benchmark specifically tailored for the agricultural context, based on video sequences taken in a table grape vineyard, particularly challenging due to strong self-similarity and density of the instances.

Recently, the use of robots in agriculture and automatic gardening has created new challenges due to the highly repetitive appearance with prevalent green color and repetitive texture of garden-like scenes.

We also provide ground truth for all possible pairs of images, indicating whether they depict the same place or not.

Santos,2020,"Agricultural robotics is nowadays a complex, challenging, and exciting research topic. Some agricultural environments present harsh conditions to robotics operability. In the case of steep slope vineyards, there are several challenges: terrain irregularities, characteristics of illumination, and inaccuracy/unavailability of signals emitted by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Under these conditions, robotics navigation becomes a challenging task. To perform these tasks safely and accurately, the extraction of reliable features or landmarks from the surrounding environment is crucial. This work intends to solve this issue, performing accurate, cheap, and fast landmark extraction in steep slope vineyard context. To do so, we used a single camera and an Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) provided by Google's USB Accelerator as a small, high-performance, and low power unit suitable for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The proposed approach performs object detection using Deep Learning (DL)-based Neural Network (NN) models on this device to detect vine trunks. To train the models, Transfer Learning (TL) is used on several pre-trained versions of MobileNet V1 and MobileNet V2. A benchmark between the two models and the different pre-trained versions is performed. The models are pre-trained in a built in-house dataset, that is publicly available containing 336 different images with approximately 1,600 annotated vine trunks. There are considered two vineyards, one using camera images with the conventional infrared filter and others with an infrablue filter. Results show that this configuration allows a fast vine trunk detection, with MobileNet V2 being the most accurate retrained detector, achieving an overall Average Precision of 52.98%.

M.P.; J.J., Sousa, Joaquim J.; A.M.T.D.S., Cunha, António Manuel Trigueiros Da Silva",2024,"The Douro Demarcated Region is fundamental to local cultural and economic identity. Despite its importance, the region faces the challenge of abandoned vineyard plots, caused, among other factors, by the high costs of maintaining vineyards on hilly terrain. To solve this problem, the European Union (EU) offers subsidies to encourage active cultivation, with the aim of protecting the region’s cultural and environmental heritage. However, monitoring actively cultivated vineyards and those that have been abandoned presents considerable logistical challenges. With 43,843 vineyards spread over 250,000 hectares of rugged terrain, control of these plots is limited, which hampers the effectiveness of preservation and incentive initiatives. Currently, the EU only inspects 5 per cent of farmers annually, which results in insufficient coverage to ensure that subsidies are properly used and vineyards are actively maintained. To complement this limited monitoring, organisations such as the Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e do Porto (IVDP) use aerial and satellite images, which are manually analysed to identify abandoned or active plots. To overcome these limitations, images can be analysed using deep learning methods, which have already shown great potential in agricultural applications. In this context, our research group has carried out some preliminary evaluations for the automatic detection of abandoned vineyards using deep learning models, which, despite showing promising results on the dataset used, proved to be limited when applied to images of the entire region. In this study, a new dataset was expanded to 137,000 images collected between 2018 and 2023, filling critical gaps in the previous datasets by including greater temporal and spatial diversity. Subsequently, a careful evaluation was carried out with various DL models. As a result, the ViT_b32 model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an average accuracy of 0.99 and an F1 score of 0.98, outperforming CNN-based models. In addition to the excellent results obtained, this dataset represents a significant contribution to advancing research in precision viticulture, providing a solid and relevant basis for future studies and driving the development of solutions applied to vineyard monitoring in the Douro Demarcated Region.

These gaps can inhibit scientific research as they impede the use of numerical models for agricultural, meteorological and climatological applications as well as introducing analytic biases. In this research, different machine learning techniques are evaluated together with traditional approaches to gap filling automated weather station data. When filling gaps for a specific data stream, data from neighbouring weather stations are used in addition to reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalyses of the global climate, ERA-5 Land. A novel gap creation method is introduced that provides 100% coverage in sampling the dataset while ensuring that the sampled data are randomly distributed. Gap filling across a range of different gap lengths and target variables are compared using a range of error functions. The variables selected for modelling are mean air temperature, dew point, mean relative humidity and leaf wetness. Our results show that models perform best on gap-filling temperature and dew point with worst performance on leaf wetness. As expected, model performance decreases with increasing gap length.

We use a novel European Union (EU) wide satellite-derived product at 10 m spatial resolution to produce datasets of crop diversity across spatial (1–100 km) and administrative scales for the year 2018. We focus on the 27 EU countries and the United Kingdom. We define local crop diversity (α-diversity) at the 1 km scale corresponding to large farms or clusters of small-to-medium sized farms. Across countries, the α crop diversity ranges from 2.3 to 4.4 with the highest levels achieved by systems dominated by a high number of small farms (less than 10 ha on average). Computed at grid level aggregation, γ-diversity (the number and area of crops that are grown independently from the precise location, for landscape region, and country levels) increases rapidly from 2.85 at 1 km to 3.86 at 10 km and levels off 4.27 at 100 km. Such diversity levels are higher than that reported for the U.S.A., likely related to differences in farm structure and practices. β-diversity, the ratio of γ and α diversity, provides a measure of the diversity between agroecosystems and ranges from 1.2 to 2.3 across EU countries. Based on the magnitude and change of γ-diversity across scales, we classify countries’ diversity in four groups with possible consequences for regional to national agro-environmental policy recommendations, in particular the monitoring activities and indicator development of interventions for the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the EU.

Changing dietary patterns is essential to reducing the substantial environment impact of agriculture and food production systems. We performed a cross-country comparison of dietary patterns and their associated environmental impact in Europe, including by sociodemographic factors. Methods. We analyzed pooled cross-sectional dietary records collected during 2010–18 from 10 European countries using the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Database (16 508 adults; aged 18–79 years). Each food consumed was mapped to the corresponding environmental impact data using the SHARP Indicators Database, which provides greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) and land use (LU) values of approximately 900 foods. Total diet-associated environmental impact was calculated for each person and averaged across multiple days. Multivariable linear regression models were used to compare diet-associated GHGE and LU between population subgroups (gender, age, education and diet type) with country-level fixed effects. Results. The mean dietary GHGE and LU per capita ranged from 4.0 kgCO<inf>2</inf>/day and 5.0 m2*year/day in Spain to 6.5 kgCO<inf>2</inf>eq/day and 8.2 m2*year/day in France.

The Directive's existing limit values for heavy metal concentrations in soils are in the process of being revised. However, to comprehensively understand their effects on EU agricultural lands, additional evaluations are necessary. This is particularly important given that ecological risk assessments are often performed on a site-specific basis, potentially overlooking broader regional implications. The main objective of the current work is to introduce a methodological approach to quantify the impact of sewage sludge (SS) application on agricultural soils in the EU and the United Kingdom. Concentrations of heavy metals (HMs) (Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn) in agricultural land from Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) 2009 topsoil database were used as a baseline. Maximum quantities of SS that can be safely applied to agricultural lands were obtained by a modeling procedure was used to determine the maximum safe quantities of SS that can be applied to agricultural lands for each country within the European Member States and the United Kingdom. Accumulation of HMs in soils was modelled by using a representative SS composition, distributed over 10 successive years at 5 Mg ha−1 year−1 rate. Ecological risk impact was assessed by using both the single ecological risk index (E<inf>r</inf>) and the integrated potential ecological risk index (RI). Maximum quantities of SS applied on agricultural soils in EU + UK were estimated to be 45 Mg ha−1 at the country level. We found that 19% of agricultural land (around 28,471,900 ha) in the EU + UK shows a higher RI than moderate risk after long time application of the representative SS. We show that the combination of the HM concentrations from the LUCAS topsoil survey and assumptions on the SS composition and soil HM partitioning can be used to define the actual and potential soil pollution rate in EU + UK. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used by policymakers, farmers, regional authorities and other stakeholders, with possible adaptions based on local in-depth soil and SS knowledge. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses the LUCAS topsoil database, which has European coverage, for an analysis of agricultural soils in the EU and UK.",Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) 2009 topsoil database

While co-analyses of hosts and pathogen genomes (co-genome-wide association studies) allow us to pinpoint the interacting genes, these do not reveal which host genotype(s) is/are resistant to which pathogen genotype(s). The knowledge of this so-called infection matrix is important for agriculture and medicine. Building on established theories of host-pathogen interactions, we here derive four novel indices capturing the characteristics of the infection matrix. These indices can be computed from full genome polymorphism data of randomly sampled uninfected hosts, as well as infected hosts and their pathogen strains. We use these indices in an approximate Bayesian computation method to pinpoint loci with relevant G×G interactions and to infer their underlying interaction matrix. In a combined single nucleotide polymorphism dataset of 451 European humans and their infecting hepatitis C virus (HCV) strains and 503 uninfected individuals, we reveal a new human candidate gene for resistance to HCV and new virus mutations matching human genes. For two groups of significant human-HCV (G×G) associations, we infer a gene-for-gene infection matrix, which is commonly assumed to be typical of plant-pathogen interactions. Our model-based inference framework bridges theoretical models of G×G interactions with host and pathogen genomic data.

This has resulted in increased pressure on surface water supplies, human consumption and socioeconomic growth. Although water management requires monitoring, a substantial amount of water consumption globally, including both groundwater and surface water, remains unmeasured. Madhya Pradesh (MP) has a very varied semi-arid geographical region in Central India. Recent studies have found that 36 out of 51 districts in the state of MP have been facing severe hydrological drought conditions. Despite the challenges in the MP region, there is little understanding of the permanent and seasonal changes in surface water and the overall availability of surface water resources in each district. Field-based monitoring of surface water bodies in large regions such as MP poses considerable difficulties. However, gaining knowledge about changes in the distribution of water on the Earth's surface across time and space can be enhanced by analysing data obtained via remote sensing.

In this study, we compare temporal trends and variability in organic carbon content (OC), pH, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in 2009–2018 across the two datasets. The national monitoring programme encompasses more monitoring plots (620 vs. 134 in 2018), while LUCAS sampling is repeated more frequently and in addition to 2009 and 2018, it also includes data from 2015. The temporal variability in all examined indicators was substantially higher in the LUCAS dataset compared to the national monitoring data. In mineral soils, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between element contents measured in 2009 and 2018 ranged between 0.82 and 0.94 in the national dataset, and between 0.52 and 0.67 in the LUCAS dataset. The results for organic soils mirrored those of mineral soils. The higher variability in the LUCAS dataset may be attributed to less precise geolocation of sampling plots and/or variations in the sampling protocol such as greater sampling depth and the use of a spade instead of a core auger. The greater temporal variability, coupled with a smaller number of sampling plots in the LUCAS dataset, resulted in lower statistical power making the detection of trends with a realistic magnitude more challenging. Further, in LUCAS data, the confidence intervals of trends were of the same magnitude, regardless of whether the data from the year 2015 was included or not.

The European Copernicus Climate Change Data Store was used to download historical and future datasets of extreme climatic indices from 1980 to 2010 and 2015–2050, respectively. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model ensemble was used to predict future climate impacts under three shared socioeconomic scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.3, and SSP5-8.5. Data extraction, quality control, and clustering were conducted before analysis, and the model was validated for its accuracy and reliability in predicting soil parameter changes. An artificial neural network model was utilized to predict the effects of extreme climate indices on soil pH and exchangeable aluminum concentrations. The model was designed to accurately and reliably predict changes in soil parameters. This study compared the changes in soil pH and aluminum concentrations using paired t tests. The model's diagnostic results indicated a significant impact of extreme climate scenarios on soil pH and exchangeable aluminum. Extreme climate factors such as heavy precipitation and cooler night time temperatures significantly contribute to soil acidification and an increase in aluminum concentration. Under the SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 emission scenarios, soil pH levels are expected to increase by 8.38 % and 3.79 %, respectively. These changes in soil pH are expected to have significant impacts on the exchangeable aluminum content in the soil, with increases of 37 % and 5.38 %, respectively, under the same emission scenarios. However, the SSP5.8 scenario predicted a 45 % increase in exchangeable aluminum and a 9.36 % decrease in soil pH.

This article aims to construct a comprehensive convergent model for assessing the global and EU’s progress, degree of consolidation and symmetry of agricultural economies towards climate neutrality in the context of key international green initiatives. Methodology / approach. This research employs both qualitative and quantitative analyses to assess convergence measures in the agricultural sector’s carbon emissions. The quantitative component relies on the sigma and beta convergence models to evaluate international convergence in carbon emissions CO2 dynamics. The dimensions of modeling are as follows: global sample within 194 countries with reliable emissions data; European Union, focusing on convergence within the EU27 member states, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine. The time period covers open data from 1972–2022. The dynamics of sigma and beta convergence is determined for the points, namely UN Stockholm Conference (1972), UN Rio Conference (1992), Kyoto Protocol (entry into force in 2005), Paris Agreement (2015). Additionally, statistical indicators of variation, skewness, Gini and Theil indices were calculated for delineating global smoothness and the concentration of agricultural emissions. Results. The results of the study reveal an inertial and divergent trend of the agricultural economy towards decarbonisation, which slows down the overall movement towards “net zero” due to the presence of clubs of lagging agricultural countries that increase emissions in violation of international agreements. The reduction in emissions skewness in recent years shows that more countries are “pulling” decarbonisation due to their high capacity to move towards net zero, but this is not enough. The EU is the most prominent example of accelerated climate convergence, but markers of its weakening in recent years are identified due to the inability of economies to maintain the pace of decarbonisation caused by economic constraints, technological barriers, policy and regulatory issues, and misunderstandings of climate neutrality goals. It is shown that the long-term decarbonisation capacity of the agricultural sector is the key trigger for a country to make a positive contribution to the global convergence towards climate neutrality. At the current stage, the pace of decarbonisation plays a much greater role for consolidating efforts in the agricultural economy and achieving climate neutrality than the initial level of emissions in the sector. Factors in this process include proactive compliance with global climate agreements, technology sharing and cooperation, digitalisation and smart agriculture, and green financing and investment. Its implementation requires a three-way integration of stakeholder actions, strategy selection and results evaluation. Originality / scientific novelty. The study’s originality lies in its large-scale analysis of over 50 years of emissions dynamics and the context of five key green agreements that provided support for the green transition. It allows studying international convergence in agricultural sectors globally and within the EU. The novelty implies the integrated use of sigma and beta convergence models that identifies predictors of convergent and divergent processes and separates countries into leaders and laggards of agricultural decarbonisation. This approach provides a comprehensive view of modern climate policy, the impact of international green initiatives, and the position of individual towards climate neutrality in agriculture. Practical value / implications. The practical value lies in the ability to adjust climate policies for the agricultural economy’s decarbonisation, facilitating the determination of prospective outcomes for achieving climate neutrality. The aforementioned factors facilitate the process of governmental decision-making. The assessment of international programmatic agreements' effectiveness is enhanced through these models. The study offers a framework for global convergence towards climate neutrality in agriculture, highlighting the importance of digital technologies and smart agriculture as significant factors in global convergence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The paper uses a global dataset, which is an exclusion criterion, as the coverage is not exclusively European.",

Research in recent decades has shown a progressive loss of blue carbon in mangrove forests as they are converted to aquaculture, agriculture, and urban development. We seek to study the relationship between human population density and soil carbon stocks in urban mangrove forests to quantify their role in the global carbon budget. To this end, we conducted a global analysis, collecting mangrove soil carbon data from previous studies and calculating population density for each study location utilizing a recent database from the European Commission. Results indicate population density has a negative association with mangrove soil carbon stocks. When human population density reaches 300 people km−2, which is defined as ‘urban domains’ in the European Commission database, mangrove soil carbon is estimated to be lower than isolated mangrove forests by 37%. Nonetheless, after accounting for climatic factors in the model, we see the negative relationship between population density and soil carbon is reduced and is even non-significant in mixed effects models.

So far, studies mainly focus on the effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, surface water eutrophication or soil nutrient accumulation. Groundwater pollution of spring habitats, however, has received much less attention, although numerous papers report groundwater nutrient enrichment worldwide. This study presents a survey on groundwater pollution (with emphasis on nitrate and phosphate) and bryophyte composition in 51 ambient petrifying springs in 5 NW European countries, which were compared to published data from 173 other sites in 11 European countries. The reviewed dataset covers a broad range of unpolluted to heavily polluted springs with nitrate concentrations between 0.7 and 3227 μmol l−1. Most petrifying springs in the rural lowlands of NW Europe were found to have elevated concentrations of nitrate and phosphate with the most polluted springs occurring in The Netherlands. The cover of individual characteristic bryophyte species significantly correlates with groundwater nutrient concentrations indicating that nutrient pollution of spring waters affects bryophyte composition. Palustriella commutata, Eucladium verticillatum and Brachythecium rivulare prefer unpolluted petrifying springs whereas Cratoneuron filicinum and Pellia endiviifolia show a much broader tolerance to groundwater pollution. In order to sustain at least the basic conditions for the typical bryophyte composition of petrifying springs habitats, threshold values of 288 μmol (18 mg l−1) NO<inf>3</inf>− l−1 and 0.42 μmol (0.04 mg l−1) ortho-PO<inf>4</inf>3- l−1 were defined. Data analysis of the spring water composition indicates that the main source for nutrient and nutrient induced base cation enrichment are nitrate losses from intensively used agricultural fields. The anthropogenically induced but regionally different chemical processes in subsoil and aquifers can result in different levels of nutrient pollution in springs. Further regulations for nitrate and phosphate application are required to conserve and restore groundwater fed ecosystems in Europe. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses a compiled dataset from a survey and published data covering multiple European countries to study groundwater pollution from agriculture, meeting all criteria.",

Cadmium inputs in the soil have increased significantly (+50 %) during the 20th century as a result of the application of fertilisers and sewage sludge, and also due to local contamination (e.g. waste dumping, mining) and industrial emissions (e.g. zinc smelters). Using the 21,682 soil samples from the LUCAS soil survey, we aim to estimate the spatial distribution of the concentration of Cd in the European Union (EU) and UK topsoil. Out of the total, 72.6 % of the samples have Cd values <0.07 mg kg−1, 21.6 % in the range 0.07–1 mg kg−1 and the remaining 5.5 % higher than the threshold of 1 mg kg−1, which is generally considered the limit for risk assessment. The mean Cd value in the EU topsoils is 0.20 mg kg−1, slightly higher in grasslands (0.24 mg kg−1) compared to croplands (0.17 mg kg−1). Applying an ensemble of machine learning models supported by a variety of environmental descriptors, we created maps of Cd distribution at a resolution of 100 m. The ensemble approach included five models and increased the prediction accuracy to R2 of 0.45 (an increase of 0.1 compared to best single model performance). The approach used resulted in a high predictive power for the general Cd distribution, while also identifying hotspots of Cd contamination. Natural factors influencing Cd levels include soil properties (pH, clay), topography, soil erosion, and leaching. As anthropogenic factors, we identified phosphorus inputs to agricultural lands as the most important for Cd levels. The application of the EU Fertiliser Directive should further limit Cd inputs and potentially the Cd content in soils. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses the LUCAS topsoil database to analyze cadmium distribution across the European Union, meeting all inclusion criteria.",LUCAS

It provides a valuable decision-making tool for spatial planning and integrated development. SEEA implementation is a current key challenge for European Union (EU) Member States (MS), mainly due to high requirements on budget, technical capacity, and data, varying between countries. Within this frame, the objective of this paper is to demonstrate how the SEEA framework can be applied to analyse water ecosystems at river basin scale, building exclusively upon the officially registered, standardized national and EU datasets. We test how water resources can be accounted for using SEEA EA, with an additional component assessing water use based on SEEA Water. Within the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), two reporting cycles of river basin management plans have been completed for water ecosystems, providing spatial and temporal datasets. This material together with numerous data available at EU and national levels, water-relevant databases and repositories, resulting from MS reporting obligations, are tested and utilised for water accounting. The Alfeios river basin in Western Peloponnisos Greece serves as the case study area for compiling extent accounts, condition accounts, and supply and use accounts for provisioning water ecosystem services (drinking and irrigation water) for the periods 2009–2015 and 2015–2021 (the two WFD reporting cycles). It is demonstrated that readily available EU datasets can support the initial mapping and compiling of water ecosystem accounts at local scale, as applied in Greece, and therefore potentially also in other EU countries with fragmented data scattered in various administrative services and authorities with overlapping responsibilities on water resources. It is also concluded that future WFD reporting cycles and revisions of the river basin management plans could be better structured to enable a more direct connection of the collected data to ecosystem accounts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study is a national/local case study (Greece), which is an exclusion criterion.",

By analyzing agricultural holdings within the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), the study aims to focus the challenges and opportunities faced by farmers in a market-driven agricultural landscape. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been instrumental in shaping the agriculture sector across member states. As the EU transitions towards a more market-oriented approach, agricultural holdings are required to adapt to changing market dynamics, technological advancements, and environmental sustainability. Hence these are the holdings which could deploy in practice the Agriculture 4.0 techniques. Through a comprehensive analysis of the FADN data, this article aims to identify the factors that contribute to the success or failure of market-oriented agricultural holdings in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian case study provides insights into the challenges faced by market-oriented agricultural holdings. The country's unique socio-economic characteristics, including a rural population and a history of agricultural production, make it an interesting case for analysis. The study examines key indicators such as farm size, land use, production diversity, and income levels within the FADN database.

At the same time, rock P is a critical raw material due to its importance for food production, the finite geological deposits, and its unequal regional distribution. As a consequence, nutrient management is addressed by numerous environmental policies. Process-based biogeochemical models are valuable instruments to monitor the P cycle and predict the effect of agricultural management policies. In this study, we upscale the calibrated DayCent model at European level using data-derived soil properties, advanced input data sets, and representative management practices. Our results depicted a P budget with an average P surplus (0.11 kg P ha−1 year−1), a total soil P (2240.0 kg P ha−1), and available P content (77.4 kg P ha−1) consistent with literature and national statistics. Through agricultural management scenarios, we revealed a range of potential changes in the P budget by 2030 and 2050, influenced by the interlink of P with biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles. Thus, we developed a powerful assessment tool capable of i) identifying areas with P surplus or deficit at high spatial resolution of 1 km2, (ii) pinpointing areas where a change in agricultural management would be most urgent to reach policy goals in terms of environmental pollution, food security and resource efficiency of a critical raw material, and iii) assessing the response of the P cycle to modifications in agricultural management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The study uses various datasets to model the phosphorus cycle in agricultural soils at a European level, meeting all criteria.",

Surprisingly, an overarching analysis of their ecological status and the stressors affecting them is yet missing. We compiled data on the ecological status of 1504 temporary rivers in seven European Mediterranean region countries and related their ecological status (1) to publicly available data on pressures from the European WISE-WFD dataset, and (2) to seven more specific stressors modelled on a sub-catchment scale. More than 50 % of the temporary water bodies in the Mediterranean countries reached good or even high ecological status. In general, status classes derived from phytobenthos and macrophyte assessment were higher than those derived from the assessment of benthic invertebrates or fish. Of the more generally defined pressures reported to the WISE-WFD database, the most relevant for temporary rivers were ‘diffuse agricultural’ and ‘point urban waste water’. Of the modelled more specific stressors, agricultural land use best explained overall ecological status, followed by total nitrogen load, and urban land use, while toxic substances, total phosphorus load and hydrological stressors were less relevant. However, stressors differed in relevance, with total nitrogen being most important for macrophytes, and agricultural land use for phytobenthos, benthic invertebrates and fish. For macrophytes, ecological quality increased with stressor intensity. The results underline the overarching effect of land use intensity for the ecological status of temporary water bodies. However, assessment results do not sufficiently reflect hydrological stress, most likely as the biological indicators used to evaluate these systems were designed for perennial water bodies and thus mainly target land use and nutrient impacts.

However, the existing ready-to-use maps are characterized mainly by a coarse spatial resolution (>200 m) and information that is not up to date, making their use insufficient for the EU’s policy requirements, such as the common agricultural policy. This work, by utilizing the Soil Data Cube, which is a self-hosted custom tool, provides yearly estimations of soil thematic maps (e.g., exposed soil, soil organic carbon, clay content) covering all the agricultural area in Lithuania. The pipeline exploits various Earth observation data such as a time series of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (2018–2022), the LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Statistical Survey) topsoil database, the European Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) and artificial intelligence (AI) architectures to improve the prediction accuracy as well as the spatial resolution (10 m), enabling discrimination at the parcel level. Five different prediction models were tested with the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to achieve the best accuracy for both targeted indicators (SOC and clay) related to the R (Formula presented.) metric (0.51 for SOC and 0.57 for clay). The model predictions supported by the prediction uncertainties based on the PIR formula (average PIR 0.48 for SOC and 0.61 for clay) provide valuable information on the model’s interpretation and stability.

Allelic combinations of major loci sustained the bread-making quality while improving grain yield. Glu-D1, Pinb-D1, and non-gluten proteins are associated with sedimentation values and falling number in European wheat. Abstract: Zeleny sedimentation values (ZSV) and Hagberg-Perten falling number (HFN) are among the most important parameters that help determine the baking quality classes of wheat and, thus, influence the monetary benefits for growers. We used a published data set of 372 European wheat varieties evaluated in replicated field trials in multiple environments. ZSV and HFN traits hold a wide and significant genotypic variation and high broad-sense heritability. The genetic correlations revealed positive and significant associations of ZSV and HFN with each other, grain protein content (GPC) and grain hardness; however, they were all significantly negatively correlated with grain yield. Besides, GPC appeared to be the major predictor for ZSV and HFN. Our genome-wide association analyses based on high-quality SSR, SNP, and candidate gene markers revealed a strong quantitative genetic nature of ZSV and HFN by explaining their total genotypic variance as 41.49% and 38.06%, respectively. The association of known Glutenin (Glu-1) and Puroindoline (Pin-1) with ZSV provided positive analytic proof of our studies. We report novel candidate loci associated with globulins and albumins—the non-gluten monomeric proteins in wheat. In addition, predictive breeding analyses for ZSV and HFN suggest using genomic selection in the early stages of breeding programs with an average prediction accuracy of 81 and 59%, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses a dataset of European wheat varieties for a European-wide analysis, which is agricultural and meets all criteria.",

This circumstance leads to the recurrent delivery of revised reanalysis databases that provide weather estimates for several decades back in time by combining the latest NWP models with observations. Since climate studies and agriculture water management applications require the availability of accurate and reliable weather data, assessing the performance of reanalysis products contributes to informed choices of potential weather proxy of ground-based agrometeorological data. CERRA (Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis) dataset is the latest regional reanalysis product released by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), in August 2022. CERRA is forced by the global ERA5 reanalysis, and it provides weather data with resolution of 5.5 km for the pan-European territory from 1984. For the first time in literature, this study explores the performance of CERRA data at 38 ground-based weather stations located in Sicily, an Italian region with Mediterranean climate, during the irrigation seasons 2003–2022. The objective of the study lies in evaluating CERRA performance with respect to air temperature, actual vapor pressure, wind speed and solar radiation that are input variables for assessing reference evapotranspiration, ET<inf>O</inf>, which is a key variable for quantifying irrigation volumes needed for water resources studies. The accuracy of ET<inf>O</inf> estimates depends on those input variables through the equation provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), i.e., the FAO Penman-Monteith equation. Here, it is also evaluated the performance of ET<inf>O</inf> estimates by using CERRA weather inputs in the FAO Penman-Monteith equation.

The estimation results show that EI positively impacts EP in 21 European countries using different econometric techniques during the 2011–2019 period. By using various econometric techniques (namely a panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) model, a feasible generalized least square estimates (FGLS) model, and the two-step general method of moment (the two-step GMM), our research demonstrates how environmental innovation impacts on environmental quality. The short- and long-term effects of autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) methods were also investigated using pooled mean groups (PMGs) to distinguish the short-run and long-run influences of EI.

Knowledge about crop sequences used in organic and conventional farming will aid the development of future farming systems through optimising crop diversity and pre-crop effects for improved resource efficiency. This study aims to investigate crop diversity and patterns in organic and conventional crop sequences in Sweden. Large-scale LPIS field data managed by the European Union (EU) Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) were used to monitor crop sequences on arable land in Sweden over 10 consecutive years (2005–2014). Individual fields (land parcels) could be followed on 40% of Sweden's total arable area (349,891 fields extracted) over the 10 years. The LPIS data was combined with information from a database on which fields were farmed organically. Crop distribution, diversity of crop sequences and pre-crops to the main cereal crops (winter wheat, spring barley) were analysed in organic and conventional farming systems in the five agricultural productivity zones of Sweden. The results showed that in the most productive zone in southernmost Sweden, small-grain cereals (particularly winter wheat) were the most common crops (62%), followed by oilseeds (11%), ley and forage crops (9%) and sugar beet (8%), when excluding permanent grassland. In the least productive zone (at higher altitudes and/or latitudes), ley and forage crops dominated (67%), followed by spring cereals (barley, oats) (23%). Crop diversity was higher in the two more productive zones (mean 4.6 crop types) than in two less productive zones (3.4) and organic farms showed 9% higher crop diversity than conventional farms in the most productive zones. Overall, in all zones, the pre-crop to winter wheat was generally a different crop type (3 out of 5 times) e.g., young ley (1–2 years) or grain legume, while the pre-crop to spring barley was most often (4 out of 5 times) another cereal. For both these crops, pre-crop type was more diverse in organic than conventional systems. These findings demonstrate that LPIS data can offer valuable insights into agronomic trends and on-farm practices regarding crop choice and that analysis of field-level LPIS data on crop sequences at large scale can reveal information about organic and conventional cropping in different productivity zones across countries. This information can be used to understand the practical limitations in the use of crop diversity to maximise pre-crop effects. This could in turn support advisory service and policy makers to facilitate more sustainable, productive and resource efficient crop production. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study has a national focus (Sweden), which is an exclusion criterion.",

However, the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of available forecast products have hindered their widespread use in such modelling applications, which usually require high-resolution input data. In this study, we applied sub-seasonal (up to 4 months) and seasonal (7 months) weather forecasts from the latest European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) seasonal forecasting system (SEAS5) in a land surface modelling approach using the Community Land Model version 5.0 (CLM5). Simulations were conducted for 2017-2020 forced with sub-seasonal and seasonal weather forecasts over two different domains with contrasting climate and cropping conditions: The German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (DE-NRW) and the Australian state of Victoria (AUS-VIC). We found that, after pre-processing of the forecast products (i.e.Temporal downscaling of precipitation and incoming short-wave radiation), the simulations forced with seasonal and sub-seasonal forecasts were able to provide a model output that was very close to the reference simulation results forced by reanalysis data (the mean annual crop yield showed maximum differences of 0.28 and 0.36gha-1 for AUS-VIC and DE-NRW respectively). Differences between seasonal and sub-seasonal experiments were insignificant. The forecast experiments were able to satisfactorily capture recorded inter-Annual variations of crop yield. In addition, they also reproduced the generally higher inter-Annual differences in crop yield across the AUS-VIC domain (approximately 50g% inter-Annual differences in recorded yields and up to 17g% inter-Annual differences in simulated yields) compared to the DE-NRW domain (approximately 15g% inter-Annual differences in recorded yields and up to 5g% in simulated yields). The high-and low-yield seasons (2020 and 2018) among the 4 simulated years were clearly reproduced in the forecast simulation results. Furthermore, sub-seasonal and seasonal simulations reflected the early harvest in the drought year of 2018 in the DE-NRW domain. However, simulated inter-Annual yield variability was lower in all simulations compared to the official statistics. While general soil moisture trends, such as the European drought in 2018, were captured by the seasonal experiments, we found systematic overestimations and underestimations in both the forecast and reference simulations compared to the Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-3 soil moisture product (SMAP L3) and the Soil Moisture Climate Change Initiative Combined dataset from the European Space Agency (ESA CCI). These observed biases of soil moisture and the low inter-Annual differences in simulated crop yield indicate the need to improve the representation of these variables in CLM5 to increase the model sensitivity to drought stress and other crop stressors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study areas are national/local (Germany and Australia) and the datasets used are global, which are exclusion criteria.",

This is not only important on the national level but also beyond, including at the European level where use cases and consequently demand for pan-European data sets have evolved in recent years. In order to satisfy these needs, several initiatives regarding cadastral and other geospatial data have been launched in the last 20 years. It started with the Permanent Committee on Cadastre in the European Union, the European Land Information Service, INSPIRE, UN-GGIM Europe and recent European policies on open data and high-value datasets. Our main question is, did those initiatives result in the possibility of building a cadastral map of Europe or not?

In the European Union (EU), large dischargers report releases of some chemicals, yet little is known of total emissions (point and diffuse) and their relative significance. We estimated copper loadings from all significant sources including industry, sewage treatment plants, surface runoff (from traffic, architecture, and atmospheric deposition), septic tanks, agriculture, mariculture, marine transport (antifoulant leaching), and natural processes. A combination of European datasets, literature, and industry data were used to generate export coefficients. These were then multiplied by activity rates to derive loads. A total of approximately 8 kt of copper per annum (ktpa) is estimated to enter freshwaters in the EU, and another 3.5 ktpa enters transitional and coastal waters. The main inputs to freshwater are natural processes (3.7 ktpa), agriculture (1.8 ktpa), and runoff (1.8 ktpa). Agricultural emissions are dominated by copper-based plant protection products and farmyard manure. Urban runoff is influenced by copper use in architecture and by vehicle brake linings. Antifoulant leaching from boats (3.2 ktpa) dominates saline water loads of copper. It is noteworthy that most of the emissions originate in a limited number of copper uses where environmental exposure and pathways exist, compared with the bulk of copper use within electrical and electronic equipment and infrastructure that has no environmental pathway during its use. A sensitivity analysis indicated significant uncertainty in data from abandoned mines and urban runoff load estimates.

First, it includes data from five different European countries (Austria, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands), targeting the problem of domain adaptation. Second, it is multitemporal and multiyear (2019–2020), therefore enabling analysis based on the growth of crops in time and yearly variability. Third, AgriSen-COG includes an anomaly detection preprocessing step, which reduces the amount of mislabeled information. AgriSen-COG comprises 6,972,485 parcels, making it the most extensive available dataset for crop type mapping. It includes two types of data: pixel-level data and parcel aggregated information. By carrying this out, we target two computer vision (CV) problems: semantic segmentation and classification. To establish the validity of the proposed dataset, we conducted several experiments using state-of-the-art deep-learning models for temporal semantic segmentation with pixel-level data (U-Net and ConvStar networks) and time-series classification with parcel aggregated information (LSTM, Transformer, TempCNN networks).

In the European Union (EU), the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) is in place to provide information on risks in the food chain. The largest number of notifications in this system concerns plants, followed by products of animal origin and other products. The goal of the study was to examine RASFF notifications for products of plant origin with respect to hazard, year, product, notifying country, origin country, notification type, notification basis, distribution status and actions taken in 1998–2020. Data were extracted from the RASFF notifications’ pre-2021 public information database. A cluster analysis using joining and the two-way joining method was applied. The notifications mainly concerned aflatoxins in pistachios from Iran, ochratoxin A in raisins from Turkey, pesticide residues in peppers from Turkey, okra, curry, rice from India, tea from China and India, and pathogenic micro-organisms in sesame from India, and also basil, mint and betel from Thailand, Vietnam and Lao Republic. To ensure the safety of food of plant origin, it is necessary to adhere to good agricultural and manufacturing practices, involve producers in the control of farmers, ensure proper transport conditions (especially from Asian countries), ensure that legislative bodies set and update hazard limits, and ensure their subsequent control by the authorities of EU countries.

Both multivariate and non-parametric convergence analyses were employed, using 27 indicators extrapolated from the FAO dataset. The results provide a reasonable assessment of the differences between countries in relation to their farming production methods and show that the levels of convergence/divergence depend on changes in agricultural activities over the past decade. Indeed, differences in land use, the application of organic fertilizers and pesticides, the raising of livestock, and GHG emissions allow “homogenous” groups of Member States with common features to be identified. It is important to understand the dynamics of different agriculture systems and production activities because, beneath management practices, there may be differences between systems.

There is an urgent need to identify sustainable livestock systems that are environmentally friendly, economically viable for farmers, and socially acceptable. To this end, diversity assessments and data-driven indicator-based sustainability assessments can be helpful tools. These two mutually reinforcing approaches each have their own dilemmas and strengths; however, their combination is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a method that simultaneously assesses the diversity and sustainability of production systems within one agricultural sector, without compromising either aspect, while overcoming the dilemmas of diversity and sustainability assessments. We test our method on the Walloon dairy and beef sectors (Belgium) and base our assessment on data from the European Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). We apply relevant classification criteria to the sample farms to group them into production systems. The core data was complemented with calculated environmental indicators to perform a comprehensive sustainability assessment, including structural, socio-economic, and environmental indicators. Our results confirm the importance of complementing sustainability assessments with diversity assessments. Our case study results show that a diversity of livestock systems coexist and that it is possible to overcome trade-offs between economic and environmental performances. Extensive grass-based systems present the best combination of economic and environmental results, which highlights the importance of preserving grassland resources at the regional level.

Privacy regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU Code of Conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement, and the proposed EU AI law, have been created to address the issue of data privacy and provide specific guidelines on when and how data can be shared between organizations.

For AD 1900, a method of integrating two sets of independent historical agricultural land data by correction and validation and supplemented by other historical cropland data are developed.

Reanalysis precipitation datasets (RPDs) are attractive alternatives for monitoring the hydro-climate cycles. However, their applicability in China has mainly been evaluated at the national scale, while less attention has been paid to the PLB or southeastern China. Here, we apply various metrics to evaluate the magnitude and spatial similarity of annual, monthly, different intensities and the spatial structure of precipitation from four reanalysis—the fifth global atmospheric analysis dataset of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (ERA5), Interim ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), Japanese 55-year Reanalysis project (JRA55) and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), against the rain-gauges over the PLB during 1980–2018. The results showed that the detection capacity of ERA5 and MERRA2 shifted around 2002, whereas that of ERA-Interim and JRA55 did not substantially change. Before 2002, ERA-Interim had the lowest biases for the magnitude of annual, monthly and different intensities of precipitation (except for heavy rain), while ERA5 and MERRA2 had strengths in capturing spatial correlation. Notably, ERA5 and MERRA2 had region-wide wet and dry biases, respectively, before 2002, which can be attributed mainly to the estimation of flood season precipitation (from April to June) and heavy rain. In contrast, the fractional contribution of light–moderate rain was underestimated and overestimated by ERA5 and MERRA2, respectively. However, after 2002, because of the improved reproducibility of flood season precipitation and heavy rain magnitude, the systematic biases of ERA5 and MERRA2 significantly decreased, especially for ERA5, which outperformed other RPDs on all aspects of precipitation.

Subsequently, an analysis of potential P fertilizer requirements was performed on agricultural soils of the European Union (EU) using the data set of the LUCAS project and how this need can be covered with a circular economy approach. Environmental factors were more relevant than crops to explain the variation in threshold values. A regression model involving soil pH and clay content and annual average rainfall as independent variables explained 61% of the variance in Olsen P threshold values. When soil pH and clay content were the only explanatory variables, the explained variance was 49%. This reveals the need to take into account factors related to P buffer and sorption capacity to estimate accurate threshold values. We detected that only 27.8% of EU cropland soils and 42.7% of grassland soils were P-responsive. We can conclude that a more precise allocation of the resource is possible in P-responsive sites and also that most of the European demand for P could be covered by recycling P from manure, wastewater, and municipal solid waste. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses data from the LUCAS project, which is an agricultural soil dataset with European coverage, meeting all inclusion criteria.",LUCAS
10.1002/inc3.11,Remote assessments of human pressure on biodiversity may miss important human threats,"C., Mammides, Christos; F., Martini, Francesco; C., Kounnamas, Constantinos",2022,"Monitoring human pressure on biodiversity within protected areas (PAs) remains a challenging task due to the vast number of PAs worldwide (>250,000) and the fact that we lack basic information for most of them. Consequently, researchers are increasingly relying on remote sensing techniques to overcome this challenge. However, remote assessments of human pressure on biodiversity may miss crucial threats, such as hunting and invasive species, which are often best documented through in situ field surveys. Here, we use a unique European Union dataset documenting human threats within 8210 PAs through field surveys to assess the relationship between those threats and three commonly used indices of human pressure that are largely derived using remote-sensing methods—the Human Footprint and Human Modification indices and the LandScan Global Population Database. We find that the indices are not always related to the threats recorded within PAs through field surveys. The indices seem to best capture threats associated with urbanization, agriculture, and pollution but not necessarily others. Although remote assessments of human pressure on biodiversity are crucial for conservation, researchers and practitioners must be aware of their limitations and must complement such assessments with information collected in the field whenever possible. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The paper uses global datasets (Human Footprint, Human Modification indices, LandScan Global Population Database), which is an exclusion criterion.",

Insects contribute to the circularity of agriculture, and are ideal candidates to complement traditional sources of protein. In this context, a working programme within the European Food Risk Assessment (EU-FORA) Fellowship Programme framework was developed at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in collaboration with the Spanish National Research Council. The purpose of this technical report is to describe the activities in which the fellow was involved. As part of the training, the fellow performed a literature search regarding insects as food and allergenicity resulting in 493 hits. Out of the literature search a comprehensive scientific database with 200 publications has been built using the application ‘EndNote’. Furthermore, an extensive scientific review with the title ‘Sustainable food systems: EU regulatory framework and contribution of insects to the Farm-to-Fork strategy’ approaching several important issues regarding insects (Regulatory frame, Market situation, Labelling and Control, Application as food/feed, Consumer acceptance and Allergenicity risk assessment) has been drafted and sent for publication in a peer reviewed journal. In order to analyse the impact of food processing on the allergenicity of insects, different food samples were prepared and artificially digested using a protocol simulating the gastrointestinal tract. Further laboratory work to analyse the readouts, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), has been discussed and proposed, scheduled for the end of July. In conclusion, the present working programme, together with additional activities and training provided by different institutions, enabled the fellow to gain a broader perspective in food safety, particularly concerning insects as novel foods and their safety assessment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The paper describes the creation of a scientific database of publications, which is likely global in scope, not exclusively European.",

In this study we reanalyzed 36 published pollen data sets with robust chronologies from Polish Lowlands to determine the patterns of large-scale forest decline after the Migration Period (fourth to sixth century CE). The study revealed substantial heterogeneity in the old-growth forest decline patterns. Using new high-resolution studies, we could better understand the timing of this transition related to increasing economic development. After the Migration Period, forest expansion continued until the seventh to ninth centuries cal. CE, when the dawn of Slavic culture resulted in large-scale forest decline, especially in north-western and north-central Poland. Later, forest decline was recorded mainly in north-eastern Poland and was related to Prussian settlements, including activities associated with the Teutonic Order, as well as with new settlements from the fourteenth century. The composite picture shows a varied spatio-temporal forest loss and transition towards the present-day, human activity dominated landscapes. However, some sites, such as in north-eastern Poland, are characterized by a less abrupt critical transition. The pristine nature of the oak-hornbeam forest had already been destroyed in Early Medieval times (eighth to ninth centuries cal. CE) and the potential for recovery was largely lost. Our study has confirmed previous assumptions that the decline of hornbeam across the Polish Lowlands may be an early indicator of local settlement processes, preceding severe forest loss, and establishment of permanent agriculture. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study uses data with national coverage (Polish Lowlands), which is an exclusion criterion.",

Particularly in urban centers, consumers have been confronted with this vulnerability, highlighting reliance on just-in-time logistics, imports and distant primary production. Urban food demand, regional food supply, land use change, and transport strategies are considered key factors for reestablishing resilient landscapes as part of a sustainable food system. Improving the sustainability of food systems in such circumstances entails working on the interrelations between food supply and demand, rural and urban food commodity production sites, and groups of involved actors and consumers. Of special significance is the agricultural land in close proximity to urban centers. Calling for more holistic approaches in the sense of inclusiveness, food security, citizen involvement and ecological principles, this article describes the use of a new decision support tool, the Metropolitan Foodscape Planner (MFP). The MFP features up-to-date European datasets to assess the potential of current agricultural land use to provide food resources (with special attention to both plant- and animal-based products) and meet the demand of city dwellers, and help to empower citizens, innovators, companies, public authorities and other stakeholders of regional food systems to build a more regionalized food supply network. The tool was tested in the context of the food system of the Copenhagen City Region in two collaborative workshops, namely one workshop with stakeholders of the Copenhagen City Region representing food consultancies, local planning authorities and researchers, and one in-person workshop masterclass with MSc students from the University of Copenhagen. Workshop participants used the tool to learn about the impacts of the current food system at the regional and international level with regard to the demand-supply paradigm of city-regions. The ultimate goal was to develop a participatory mapping exercise and test three food system scenarios for a more regionalized and sustainable food system and, therefore, with increased resilience to crises.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of European integration on the competitiveness of the agricultural sector in countries that acceded to the EU in or after 2004. The assessment of the competitiveness of the agricultural sector was made using the following indicators: land and labour productivity in agriculture, importance of the agricultural sector in the economy of the EU countries, agricultural trade balance, importance of agricultural export in total export of the EU countries, trade coverage ratio, Grubel–Lloyd intra-industry specialization indicator, and Balassa comparative advantage indicator. The analysis was carried out from 2004 to 2020 with the Eurostat statistical database. The outcome of surveys implies that a gap still exists between the old and the new member states of the European Union (EU) in the efficient utilisation of their production factors, despite an increased dynamics of growth in labour productivity compared with the old member states, the so-called EU-15.

However, little published research has investigated the alternation of PET due to climate change in the case of Iraq. The objective of the present study was to analyze the spatial trends in annual and seasonal PET in Iraq. Accordingly, the latest global ERA5-Land dataset of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for 1981–2021 was employed. The PET was estimated using the FAO-Penman–Monteith method. The modified Mann–Kendall statistical test was applied to evaluate the significance of the trends in PET, which can separate unidirectional trends caused by climate change from the natural variability of climate. The attained results indicate that: (1) Over the past four decades, the annual and seasonal PET witnessed a significant increasing trend in almost all of Iraq, except for the alluvial plain in the eastern and southeastern parts. (2) The increasing trend in PET confirmed the patterns of the trend significance, with the highest increase of 0.28–0.65 mm/decade in southwest Iraq. (3) Summer had the highest upward trend of 0.35–0.65 mm/decade, followed by spring, autumn, and winter. (4) The air temperature was the predominant driving factor of rising PET, showing a positive correlation ranging from 0.77 to 0.88 and a contribution of 26 to 94%, mainly in the south, central, and northwest regions. The reverse contribution of wind speed and surface pressure to PET, particularly in the southeast and southwest, remains offset by the influence of air temperature and net solar radiation.

Therefore, high-resolution SOC maps are required. Machine learning (ML) offers new opportunities to develop these maps due to its ability to data mine large datasets. The aim of this study was to apply three algorithms commonly used in digital soil mapping - random forest (RF), boosted regression trees (BRT), and support vector machine for regression (SVR) - on the first German agricultural soil inventory to model the agricultural topsoil (0-30 cm) SOC content and develop a two-model approach to address the high variability in SOC in German agricultural soils. Model performance is often limited by the size and quality of the soil dataset available for calibration and validation. Therefore, the impact of enlarging the training dataset was tested by including data from the European Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey for agricultural sites in Germany. Nested cross-validation was implemented for model evaluation and parameter tuning. Grid search and the differential evolution algorithm were also applied to ensure that each algorithm was appropriately tuned . The SOC content of the German agricultural soil inventory was highly variable, ranging from 4 to 480 g kg-1. However, only 4% of all soils contained more than 87 g kg-1 SOC and were considered organic or degraded organic soils. The results showed that SVR produced the best performance, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 32 g kg-1 when the algorithms were trained on the full dataset. However, the average RMSE of all algorithms decreased by 34% when mineral and organic soils were modelled separately, with the best result from SVR presenting an RMSE of 21 g kg-1. The model performance was enhanced by up to 1% for mineral soils and by up to 2% for organic soils. Despite the ability of machine learning algorithms, in general, and SVR, in particular, to model SOC on a national scale, the study showed that the most important aspect for improving the model performance was to separate the modelling of mineral and organic soils. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study focuses on a national scale (Germany) and uses a national dataset ('German agricultural soil inventory'), which is an exclusion criterion.",

The Republic of Ireland (RoI) is characterised by the highest incidence of verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) enteritis in the European Union (EU), linked to high reliance on unregulated groundwater sources (~16% of the population). Yet, the spatio-temporal factors influencing the frequency and magnitude of microbial contamination remain largely unknown, with past studies typically constrained to spatio-temporally ‘limited’ sampling campaigns. Accordingly, the current investigation sought to analyse an extensive spatially distributed time-series (2011−2020) of groundwater monitoring data in the RoI. The dataset, compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), showed ‘high’ contamination rates, with 66.7% (88/132) of supplies testing positive for E. coli, and 29.5% (39/132) exceeding concentrations of 10MPN/100 ml (i.e. gross contamination) at least once during the 10-year monitoring period. Seasonal decomposition analyses indicate that E. coli detection rates peak during late autumn/early winter, coinciding with increases in annual rainfall, while gross contamination peaks in spring (May) and late-summer (August), likely reflecting seasonal shifts in agricultural practices. Mixed effects logistic regression modelling indicates that monitoring sources located in karst limestone are statistically associated with E. coli presence (OR = 2.76, p = 0.03) and gross contamination (OR = 2.54, p = 0.037) when compared to poorly productive aquifers (i.e., transmissivity below 10m2/d). Moreover, 5-day and 30-day antecedent rainfall increased the likelihood of E. coli contamination (OR = 1.027, p < 0.001 and OR = 1.005, p = 0.016, respectively), with the former also being associated with gross contamination (OR = 1.042, p < 0.001). As such, it is inferred that preferential flow and direct ingress of surface runoff are the most likely ingress mechanisms associated with E. coli groundwater supply contamination.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a content and thematic analysis of 325 academic sources extracted from the Scopus database and 683 patents retrieved from the European Patent Office (EPO) dataset. Additionally, the research applies the Kruskal–Wallis test as a non-parametric test for evaluating differences in the main concepts discussed in the two sources. Findings: The academic and practitioners' debate highlights a trading zone among the two streams. patents' analysis from the EPO reveals four main common themes as a new business that benefits from AI in weather predictions, new smart and intelligent ways to monitor crops, new businesses that use clouds to control plant's humidity. The analysis of Scopus's sources demonstrates theoretical approaches related to the technology acceptance model (TAM) and practical strategies in terms of entrepreneurial skills to support the agricultural sector. However, barriers among the two streams of sources exist in innovation management and scale-up entrepreneurial initiatives. Research limitations/implications: Regarding implications, the authors aim to connect academic and practitioners' views by understanding the new potential innovation applications and the connected new research avenues. Limitations might arise from the sources used to develop our analysis. Originality/value: The paper is novel because it investigates the issues arising from the relationship between AE and new technologies by examining original validated patents released by practitioners and approved by the EPO, rather than reviewing blogs or the financial press.

Green public areas contribute to mitigation and adaptation strategies for addressing climate changes, but their maintenance has a significant cost. Frequent grass cutting operations must be carried out during growing periods to ensure the safe livability of UOS to citizens. In the present paper, a geo database was developed to map green public areas of the city of Latina (Lazio Region, Central Italy) by using a multisource dataset according to the European INSPIRE Directive. The GreenCAL Tool was implemented. Two algorithms to determine UOS extension and the necessary budget for grass cutting operations are used, considering the contribution of different mowing (i.e., mulcher, lawnmower, or brush cutter) and UOS extension itself (~160 ha). The implemented processing chain allowed us to simulate forestation of abandoned areas and potential CO2 sequestration values. Two different scenarios of maintenance programs were also implemented to reduce more than 60% of operational cost according to: (1) different use of UOS; (2) their position within the urban area; (3) guidelines of Italian working group on public green management; and (4) management of vegetal residues. The management of the latter, derived by mowing, contribute to more than 23% of the budget allocated to maintain UOS. Besides the long‐term environmental and health perspective, the short‐term impact of the present applied research is relevant for a geomatic approach, green public procurements, as well as land use and climate interactions.

However, this is frequently omitted, and the vegetation conditions are approximated by assigning constant values to static classified Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps, such as the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) Land Cover (CLC). Using as test site the Sperchios River catchment, Central Greece, this study introduces a new approach to estimate C-factor in a spatiotemporally exhaustive manner. The goal is to increase estimation accuracy in erosion modelling applications. The C-factor computations are performed on monthly scale, based on LULC maps that portray the basin's agricultural areas in unprecedented detail. The methodology involves the use of a biophysical index, namely Fraction of Vegetation Cover (F<inf>cover</inf>) and empirical literature data on crop types. F<inf>cover</inf> was developed from Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery in 10-m analysis. Such analysis (compared to the 300-m one provided by the EU) is a major improvement towards a more precise estimation of C-factor.

In Europe, member states of the European Union collect geospatial data in the framework of the Land Parcel Information System (LPIS) for agricultural management and subsidizing farmers. These data can be exploited as training datasets of machine learning classifiers for crop-type mapping applications. However, the way the LPIS data are being generated, concerning primarily errors in the farmers' declarations in terms of crop-type labels, exact geometries, etc, constrains their direct use in such classification frameworks. In this study, we present and assess a methodology for filtering LPIS data based on geometric and spectral criteria in order to build a trustworthy training dataset for machine learning crop-type classifiers. A new nomenclature was developed, oriented towards the spectral discrimination of crop-type classes and sub-classes in Greece. The filtering methodology was applied at national scale for the agricultural year of 2019 and resulted in the selection of a sub-set of the LPIS parcels that were assessed as the most suitable and reliable to represent the different levels of the nomenclature.

Hence, the impacts of drought on the environment and society will also increase considerably. Monitoring and early warning systems for drought rely on several indicators; however, assessments of how these indicators are linked to impacts are still lacking. Here, we explore the links between different drought indicators and drought impacts within six sub-regions in Spain. We used impact data from the European Drought Impact Report Inventory database and provide a new case study to evaluate these links. We provide evidence that a region with a small sample size of impact data can still provide useful insights regarding indicator-impact links. As meteorological drought indicators, we use the Standardised Precipitation Index and the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; as agricultural and hydrological drought indicators, we use a Standardised Soil Water Content Index and a Standardised Streamflow Index and a Standardised Reservoir Storage Index. We also explore the links between drought impacts and teleconnection patterns and surface temperature by conducting a correlation analysis, and then we test the predictability of drought impacts using a random forest model. Our results show that meteorological indices are best linked to impact occurrences overall and at long timescales between 15 and 33 months. However, we also find robust links for agricultural and hydrological drought indices, depending on the sub-region. The Arctic Oscillation, Western Mediterranean Oscillation, and the North Atlantic Oscillation at long accumulation periods (15 to 48 months) are top predictors of impacts in the northwestern and northeastern regions, the community of Madrid, and the southern regions of Spain, respectively. We also find links between temperature and drought impacts. The random forest model produces skilful models for most sub-regions. When assessed using a cross-validation analysis, the models in all regions show precision, recall, or R2 values higher than 0.97, 0.62, and 0.68, respectively. Thus, our random forest models are skilful in predicting drought impacts and could potentially be used as part of an early warning system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses data from the European Drought Impact Report Inventory database, which has European coverage, for a study related to agriculture.",European Drought Impact Report Inventory

Therefore, government institutes developed guidelines to prevent heat-related illnesses and death during high heat exposures. The guidelines use Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), which integrates temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed. However, occupational heat exposure guidelines cannot be readily applied to outdoor work places due to limited WBGT validation studies. In recent years, institutions have started providing experimental WBGT forecasts. These experimental products are continually being refined and have been minimally validated with ground-based observations. This study evaluated a modified WBGT hindcast using the historical National Digital Forecast Database and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5. We verified the hindcasts with hourly WBGT estimated from ground-based weather observations. After controlling for geographic attributes and temporal trends, the average difference between the hindcast and in situ data varied from −0.64°C to 1.46°C for different Köppen-Geiger climate regions, and the average differences are reliable for decision making. However, the results showed statistically significant variances according to geographical features such as aspect, coastal proximity, land use, topographic position index, and Köppen-Geiger climate categories.

Information about the change in nitrate leaching with changes in mineral N fertilizer rates is important under such conditions. The increase in nitrate leaching due to extra mineral N application near the economic optimal N application for crop production, called marginal nitrate leaching, depends on a number of factors like soil type, crop types, climatic conditions and N fertilization rates. In this study, we collected published experimental data from 44 site-years from Denmark and 31 site-years from other European countries (Germany, Sweden, UK) with measured nitrate leaching at increasing mineral N fertilizer rates. We focused on obtaining marginal nitrate leaching around optimal N rates based on available information from the different field experiments. The measured nitrate leaching varied from 3 to 92 kg N ha-1 in the Danish dataset. For the European data set, it varied from 1 to 124 kg N ha-1. The median and mean of the estimated marginal nitrate leaching at the optimal N rates were 17.0% and 20.5%, respectively, in the Danish dataset and 9.0% and 14.9%, respectively, in the European dataset. At the optimal N rate, a positive relationship was found between yearly nitrate leaching and marginal nitrate leaching. Both nitrate leaching and marginal nitrate leaching at the optimal N rate were positively correlated with precipitation during the hydrological year and winter periods, but not to any other environmental factors tested. There was no significant difference in either marginal nitrate leaching or nitrate leaching between growing spring cereals versus winter cereals. No significant effect of winter vegetation cover on marginal nitrate leaching was detected. Furthermore, the marginal nitrate leaching at the optimal N rate in the first year of the experiments with increasing N rates was significantly lower than the accumulated effect of two or more years with low or high N rates. Therefore, the long-term effects of N rates should be accounted for when estimating marginal nitrate leaching. The marginal nitrate leaching is highly variable between years and only a part of this variation was explained in this study. The positive correlation between marginal nitrate leaching and nitrate leaching at optimum N rates implies that cropping system and management factors reducing nitrate leaching also reduce the marginal nitrate leaching. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper compiles and uses a dataset from agricultural experiments in multiple European countries (Denmark, Germany, Sweden, UK).",

Infantis population present in Italy over the last two decades. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the majority of strains isolated from poultry and turkeys from Abruzzo and Molise were closely related and belonged to one of the two main genetic clusters present in Italy, which were grouped predominantly as ESBL-producing strains that harbored pESI-like plasmid. We showed that 60% of the local strains carried multiple antibiotic resistance genes, including ESBL gene bla<inf>CTX–M–1</inf> as well as aadA1, dfrA1, dfrA14, sul1, and tet(A) genes present on the pESI-like megaplasmid.

The monitoring and forecasting of drought events has drawn increasing attention. However, compared with the various monthly drought indices and their wide application in drought research, daily drought indices, which would be much more suitable for drought monitoring and forecasting, are still scarce. The development of a daily drought index would improve the accuracy of drought monitoring and forecasting, and facilitate the evaluation of existing indices. In this study, we constructed a new daily drought index, the daily evapotranspiration deficit index (DEDI), based on actual and potential evapotranspiration data from the high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis dataset of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. This new index was then applied to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of four drought events that occurred in southwest, north, northeast, and eastern northwest China in the spring and summer of 2019. Comparisons with the operationally used Meteorological Drought Composite Index and another commonly used index, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, indicated that DEDI characterized the spatiotemporal evolution of the four drought events reasonably well and was superior in depicting the onset and cessation of the drought events, as well as multiple drought intensity peaks. Additionally, DEDI considers land surface conditions, such as vegetation coverage, which enables its potential application not only for meteorological purposes but also for agricultural drought warning and monitoring.

This study aims to bring novelty for the whole spectrum of stakeholder types in these domains. The analysis of these impacts may bring relevant insights, especially, for adjustments in the design of future strategies and plans. We analyse the evolution of the EU farm types in the last two decades with significant scenario changes like two large common agricultural policy (CAP) reforms (2003 and 2013) and suggest new approaches to the design for future measures. Statistical information from the FADN over the period 2004-2018 is considered.

The aim was to check the suitability of the collections for joint analysis and for addressing research questions from the opposing domains. We asked: are these collections complementary? If so, how can they be used for joint analysis?. Location: Europe. Methods: We compared 13 311 phytosociological relevés and 13 328 records from weed science, concerning both data collection properties and the recorded species richness. To deal with bias in the data, we also analysed different subsets (i.e., crops, geographical regions, organic vs conventional fields, center vs edge plots). Results: Records from vegetation science have an average species number of 19.0 ± 10.4. Metadata on survey methodology or agronomic practices are rare in this collection. Records from weed science have an average species number of 8.5 ± 6.4. They are accompanied by extensive methodological information. Vegetation science records and the weed science records taken at field edges or from organic fields have similar species numbers.

This paper analyses the influence of European farmers’ responsiveness to changes in agri-commodity prices on how they manage the trade-offs between agricultural expansion and forestland preservation. In so doing, we rely on a comprehensive dataset relating to European agricultural holdings over the period of 2008–2017, covering 128 regions, and use a recursive equation system that links commodity prices to economic output per area, and the latter to forestland privately owned by farmers. Controlling for farm characteristics, geographical spillovers as well as regressor endogeneity, we find results suggesting that there is indeed evidence of such a trade-off. Specifically, with increased prices, European agricultural holdings expand crop production (respectively agricultural land), which reversely conflicts with private forestland. Replicating the analysis on different subsamples confirms the robustness of these findings. Based on these results, we advocate for further incentive towards the preservation of forests privately owned by agricultural holdings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",maybe,"The abstract mentions using a 'comprehensive dataset relating to European agricultural holdings', which meets the thematic and geographic criteria.

This article examines the efforts and challenges met by a French company that developed an offer of weather services based on the commodification of both open weather data and local observations produced by low-cost stations used by farmers. However, the paper shows that such commercialization of stations’ data is hampered both by their material friction with the weather infrastructure and by an economic friction related to data’s heterogeneous valuations. As solving the economic friction generated by data’s valuation is the priority of commercial meteorologists, they finally differentiate their offer using simulated weather data produced by computing models. Finally, the paper claims that the commercial process inherent to the use of this other type of data subordinates weather science to a logic of services: when designing a service for agriculture, the company considered that simulated data were more suited to digital farm advising services.

Plant physiological stable oxygen isotope models simulate how precipitation δ18O values and climatic variables shape the δ18O values of water and organic compounds in plants. These models have the potential to simplify, speed up, and improve conventional stable isotope applications and produce temporally resolved, accurate, and precise region-of-origin assignments for agricultural food products. However, the validation of these models and thus the best choice of model parameters and input variables have limited the application of the models for the origin identification of food. In our study we test model predictions against a unique 11-year European strawberry δ18O reference dataset to evaluate how choices of input variable sources and model parameterization impact the prediction skill of the model. Our results show that modifying leaf-based model parameters specifically for fruit and with product-independent, but growth time specific environmental input data, plant physiological isotope models offer a new and dynamic method that can accurately predict the geographic origin of a plant product and can advance the field of stable isotope analysis to counter food fraud. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",maybe,"The abstract mentions a 'European strawberry δ18O reference dataset', which meets the topic and coverage criteria.

Soil spectroscopy in the visible-near infrared range is a fast and cost-effective analytical technique to predict soil properties. Although traditional machine learning methods are widely used for modeling soil spectral data, large spectral datasets may require better analytical methods for big data. Here, we explored the modeling potential of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for soil properties based on a large soil spectral library. The European topsoil dataset provided by the Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) was used for DCNN modeling with the original absorbance spectra. Two single-task 16-layer DCNN models (LucasResNet-16 and LucasVGGNet-16) were used to make regression predictions of seven soil properties and classification predictions of soil texture. The effects of data pre-processing on single-task and multi-task DCNN modeling were assessed. The SHapley Additive exPlanations method was used to interpret the output of a DCNN model (LucasResNet-16). The DCNN models produced accurate predictions for most soil properties, and were superior to a single-task shallow convolutional neural network and traditional machine learning methods. Spectral transformation was effective for predicting some soil properties, while spectral downsampling led to a reduction in the modeling accuracy. The performance of a multi-task DCNN model built on the basis of LucasResNet-16 was improved compared with the performance of the single-task model. Soil organic carbon content, nitrogen content, cation exchange capacity, pH, and calcium carbonate content were well predicted, with the root mean squared error of 19.130 g∙kg−1, 0.971 g∙kg−1, 6.614 cmol(+)∙kg−1, 0.326, and 24.526 g∙kg−1, respectively. The overall classification accuracy of soil texture was 0.749 (four groups) and 0.566 (12 levels).

The agricultural land cover category includes various types of land use with different levels of human impact. The heterogeneity and spatial structure of these landscapes vary among regions and countries, but the decline of farmland bird species population can be observed in almost all European countries. This decrease can be detected from the abundance data of farmland birds, such as the Eurasian skylark (Alauda arvensis). Some small-scale studies have analysed the relation between country and regional-level land cover types and the population data of farmland birds. Europe-wide analysis is necessary to detect the land use land cover (LULC) types that are suitable habitat for the skylark and to compare the population density data of skylarks in Hungary and Schleswig-Holstein, with the pan-European LULC datasets. In this study, we used the Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2012 dataset from the European Union and two (Hungarian and German) bird monitoring datasets were aggregated at the same grid size (5 × 5 km). Based on the CLC land cover dataset, we identified the land cover types of the Eurasian skylark habitat. We performed our statistical calculations by generalised linear models (GLMs) in R to determine the impact of land cover types on the abundance of skylarks. We applied negative binomial models to account for the over-dispersion of the skylark abundance data and the step AIC function with the stepwise function in both directions. In Hungary, we found a significant positive relation between skylark abundance and the Natural grassland LULC category and six significant negative relation s (e.g., Fruit trees and berry plantations; Complex cultivation patterns and Forests). In Schleswig-Holstein, we found significant positive relations between skylark abundance and Pastures and Natural grasslands. We identified the land cover types which shows positive relation s with skylark abundance as skylark habitat areas and the land cover types with negative relations with skylark abundance as skylark non-habitat areas. We calculated the habitat and non-habitat areas of the Eurasian skylark for each grid size (5 × 5 km) of CLC database and visualised the habitat changes between 2000 and 2018. We calculated habitat changes of European countries and compared it with the country level population change data of Eurasian skylark.

Undoubtedly, warmer winters and earlier springs produce changes in frost regimes and severity that will affect the sustainability of agricultural production in the area. The Mediterranean region and the Iberian Peninsula (IP) are among the areas where the greatest impact of climate change is expected. Daily data from 68 weather stations of the IP belonging to the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (1975-2018) were used to conduct a spatiotemporal study of the frost regime. The variables calculated include the probability of three frost types according to their severity, frost day, mean absolute minimum yearly temperature, first frost day, last frost day, and frost-free period. These variables were integrated into a geographic information system, which allowed the graphical visualization of their patterns using of geostatistical interpolation techniques (kriging). Changes in frost variables were investigated using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator. A general reduction in the number of frosts per year is observed (values between −0.04- and −0.8- day frosts per year), as well as an increase in the mean absolute minimum temperature (values between 0.04 and 0.10 °C per year), with very high significant trends throughout the territory. The reduction in the number of frosts is more pronounced at a higher elevation. Frost dates vary greatly due to the orographic characteristics of the IP. The generalized trend is of a significant delay of the autumn frosts (values between 0.4 and 1.06 days/year), as well as early spring frosts (between −0.429 and −1.29 days/year), and as a consequence a longer frost-free period, all changes were much stronger than those found in other regions of the world.

The development of agriculture in Poland and its production capacity are considerably differentiated in terms of space. At present, Poland has agricultural areas which, in many respects, have a chance of competing with agriculture in the other member states of the European Union. However, in some areas, agricultural production run by private farms owned by individuals is on the verge of falling below the limit of profitability or falls below the limit of profitability. Currently, Poland lacks tools (strategies) allowing identification of land for intensive agricultural production as well as information about agricultural land that should be developed for non-agricultural purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a methodology for identifying similar areas using available tools that can facilitate reliable identification of the areas relating to the indicated factors. Taxonomic methods can be used for clustering purposes. The study materials are data derived from real property register databases referring to one of the districts (poviats) situated in east-central Poland. As a final result, a method of clustering villages according to similar land-use categories was developed. It was created using two independent statistical methods: Ward’s method and the complete-linkage method. The highest consistency was observed in two groups of identified types of areas sharing very similar characteristics.

Therefore, this research assessed the classification accuracy using the recent Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR and Sentinel-2 (S2) time-series data for LC mapping, especially vegetation classes. Additionally, ancillary data, such as texture features, spectral indices from S1 and S2, respectively, as well as digital elevation model (DEM), were used in different classification scenarios. Random Forest (RF) was used for classification tasks using a proposed hybrid reference dataset derived from European Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey (LUCAS), CORINE, and Land Parcel Identification Systems (LPIS) LC database.

These trials were conducted according to neither current European Union (EU) agricultural practice nor to recommendations given in the GD about how to conduct wildlife-relevant residue studies. Therefore, field study data on fruit residue levels from applications of pesticides in fruiting crops were compiled and evaluated.

In this study, a comprehensive model to estimate crop growth and irrigation requirements of 26 main crops at global scale is presented. The model computes a soil water balance using daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration based on a high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis dataset from the European Copernicus Program. The irrigation requirement, defined as the minimum water volume to avoid water stress, is computed for year 2000 at the resolution of 5 arc-min (or 0.0833°) and aggregated at different spatial and temporal scales for relevant analyses. The estimated global irrigation requirements for 962 km3 is described in detail, also in relation to the spatial variability and to the monthly variation of the requirements.

In recent years, tropospheric ozone has been recognized as an important greenhouse gas and pollutant that is detrimental to human health, agriculture, and natural ecosystems, and has shown a trend of increasing interest. Machinelearning- based approaches have been widely applied to the estimation of tropospheric ozone concentrations, but few studies have included tropospheric ozone profiles. This study aimed to predict the Northern Hemisphere distribution of Lower-Stratosphere-to-Troposphere (LST) ozone at a pressure of 100 hPa to the near surface by employing a deep learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. We referred to a history of all the observed parameters (meteorological data of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), satellite data, and the ozone profiles of the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC)) between 2014 and 2018 for training the predictive models. Model-measurement comparisons for the monitoring sites of WOUDC for the period 2019-2020 show that the mean correlation coefficients (R2) in the Northern Hemisphere at high latitude (NH), Northern Hemisphere at middle latitude (NM), and Northern Hemisphere at low latitude (NL) are 0.928, 0.885, and 0.590, respectively, indicating reasonable performance for the LSTM forecasting model. To improve the performance of the model, we applied the LSTM migration models to the Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container (CARIBIC) flights in the Northern Hemisphere from 2018 to 2019 and three urban agglomerations (the Sichuan Basin (SCB), North China Plain (NCP), and Yangtze River Delta region (YRD)) between 2018 and 2019. The results show that our models performed well on the CARIBIC data set, with a high R2 equal to 0.754. The daily and monthly surface ozone concentrations for 2018-2019 in the three urban agglomerations were estimated from meteorological and ancillary variables. Our results suggest that the LSTM models can accurately estimate the monthly surface ozone concentrations in the three clusters, with relatively high coefficients of 0.815-0.889, root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.769-8.729 ppb, and mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 6.111-6.930 ppb.

This is partly due to the difficulty of assessing the N requirements of each component in the mixture separately in order to correctly drive the performance of the whole system. The methods used to assess plant N nutrition status were initially developed for sole crops. In this review, i) we present different approaches adapted from these previous works to determine the N nutrition status of crops in intercrops; ii) we then compare the predictions of some of them, based on a European database of experimental results regarding cereal–grain legume and perennial grass–legume mixtures; and iii) we discuss the interests and limitations of current indices for mixed crops. We conclude that no single approach is currently valid to assess the N nutrition status of crops within the entire range of possible mixtures explored by farmers.

10.1016/j.agee.2020.107248,Habitat niches suggest that non-crop habitat types differ in quality as source habitats for Central European agrobiont spiders,"R., Michalko, Radek; K., Birkhofer, Klaus",2021,"Non-crop habitats in agricultural landscapes may differ in their potential to serve as source habitats for natural enemies. To determine this potential for different habitat types, it is crucial to understand habitat preferences and the habitat niche width of natural enemies. In addition, populations of natural enemies are affected by management practices depending on their preferences for habitat strata. Here we analysed agrobiont spider preferences (very common species in arable fields) for different microhabitats (ground, herbaceous, and shrub strata) and non-crop habitats (agroecosystems, forests, scrub, meadows, steppe, and wetlands). We compared guild-specific preferences of cursorial and web-building spiders that inhabit pome fruit orchards and cereal fields using two databases on Central European spider preferences. The majority of agrobiont spiders showed a moderate niche width. Agrobiont spiders from orchards preferred the shrub stratum while spiders from cereal fields preferred the ground and herbaceous strata across habitats. Agrobiont spiders primarily utilized non-crop habitats that were structurally similar to a particular agroecosystem: spiders from orchards utilized mostly woody vegetation while spiders from cereal fields utilized mostly meadows. Moreover, cursorial and web-building spider species from cereal fields differed in their preferences for different non-crop habitats. The results highlight that non-crop habitats have different potential as sources of agrobiont spiders. The composition of non-crop habitats in agricultural landscapes may affect the functional composition and pest control potential of spider communities. Further studies focusing on the effects that landscapes have on natural enemies in local agroecosystem need to account for the identity of non-crop habitats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",maybe,"The abstract mentions using two databases with Central European coverage related to agriculture, but the specific names of the databases are not provided, making it unclear if they are identifiable public resources.",

Mediterranean coastal lagoons have been historically altered, with their catchment being highly modified for agricultural, livestock, or urban uses. Changes in land uses induce pressures that impact the waterbodies and alter their ecological status. The objectives of this paper were: To develop a methodological approach (LUPLES: Land Uses for estimating Pressure Levels to approach the Ecological Status), to quantify the main pressures on the waterbodies and to forecast the possible impacts of these pressures on their ecological status. Corine-Land Cover maps and Geographic Information System technics were used to delineate and identify land uses in the catchments. Specific algorithms were created to quantify the main pressures from land uses in the catchment and hydro-morphological alterations in the immediate basin. The values of the estimated pressure levels were correlated with ecological status indicators using metrics developed for the European Water Framework Directive. Data were obtained from European and River Basin Authorities databases. Results showed statistically significant correlations between the pressure levels quantified by the LUPLES method and the impact level detected by biological, physical and chemical metrics. This method provides a useful approach to estimate the pressure levels affecting lentic waterbodies and could be applied to approach how they could affect their ecological status. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses Corine Land Cover and other European databases for an agricultural-related study, meeting all inclusion criteria.",Corine Land Cover

We propose a method for identifying periods of high forecast confidence using atmospheric circulation patterns, with an application to southern Australia precipitation. In particular, we use archetypal analysis to derive six patterns, called archetypes, of daily 500-hPa geopotential height (Z<inf>500</inf>) fields over Australia. We assign Z<inf>500</inf> reanalysis fields to the closest-matching archetype and subsequently link the archetypes to precipitation for three key regions in the Australian agriculture and energy sectors: the Murray Basin, southwest Western Australia, and western Tasmania. Using a 20-yr hindcast dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction system, we identify periods of high confidence as when hindcast Z<inf>500</inf> fields closely match an archetype according to a distance criterion. We compare the precipitation hindcast accuracy during these confident periods compared to normal. Considering all archetypes, we show that there is greater skill during confident periods for lead times of less than 10 days in the Murray Basin and western Tasmania, and for greater than 6 days in southwest Western Australia, although these conclusions are subject to substantial uncertainty. By breaking down the skill results for each archetype individually, we highlight how skill tends to be greater than normal for those archetypes associated with drier-than-average conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study area is Australia and the dataset used (ECMWF) is global, not exclusively European.",

This involved a preliminary parameterization step of the dynamic factor describing the ageing of radiocesium in the root zone using a Bayesian approach. A data set with mid-term (10 years about) and long term (more than 20 years) field and literature data from 4 European countries was used. A double kinetics of the bioavailability decay was evidenced with two half-life periods equal to 0.46 ± 0.11 yr and 9.57 ± 1.12 yr for the fast and slow declining rates respectively. We, then, tested a few existing alternative models proposed in literature. The comparison with field data showed that these models always underestimated the observations by one to two orders of magnitude, suggesting that the solid-liquid partition coefficient (Kd) was overestimated by models. The results suggest that semi mechanistic models might fail in the long-term prediction of the radionuclide transfer from soil-to-plant in the food chain.

To measure the size of the bioeconomy in European Union (EU) countries, it is necessary to create appropriate indicators that allow it to be monitored with reference to its current state, growth rate and sector description. In many countries, including Poland, there is no complete information or data collection system to monitor bioeconomy development directly, e.g. in the Polish Central Statistical Office. In response to these needs, several groups of indicators related to the circular economy, sustainable development and Europe 2020 were created by the European Commission (EC) in the Eurostat database. These indicators can help monitoring of bioeconomy development in EU countries. The present study discusses factors for bioeconomy development through an analysis of their social, economic and environmental aspects, as well as showing the value of the selected indicators in the EU and Poland.

Speciated measurements were made with a low-volume denuder and filter pack method (DEnuder for Long-Term Atmospheric sampling, DELTA) as part of the EU NitroEurope (NEU) integrated project. Altogether, there were 64 sites in 20 countries (2006-2010), coordinated between seven European laboratories. Bulk wet-deposition measurements were carried out at 16 co-located sites (2008- 2010). Inter-comparisons of chemical analysis and DELTA measurements allowed an assessment of comparability between laboratories. The form and concentrations of the different gas and aerosol components measured varied between individual sites and grouped sites according to country, European regions, and four main ecosystem types (crops, grassland, forests, and semi-natural). The smallest concentrations (with the exception of SO<inf>2</inf>4 and NaC) were in northern Europe (Scandinavia), with broad elevations of all components across other regions. SO<inf>2</inf>concentrations were highest in central and eastern Europe, with larger SO<inf>2</inf>emissions, but particulate SO<inf>2</inf>4 concentrations were more homogeneous between regions. Gas-phase NH3 was the most abundant single measured component at the majority of sites, with the largest variability in concentrations across the network. The largest concentrations of NH3, NH<inf>C4</inf>, and NO<inf>3</inf>were at cropland sites in intensively managed agricultural areas (e.g. Borgo Cioffi in Italy), and the smallest were at remote semi-natural and forest sites (e.g. Lompolojankka, Finland), highlighting the potential for NH3 to drive the formation of both NH<inf>C4</inf>and NO<inf>3</inf>aerosol. In the aerosol phase, NH<inf>C4</inf>was highly corre-lated with both NO<inf>3</inf>and SO<inf>2</inf>4 , with a near-1 V 1 relationship between the equivalent concentrations of NH<inf>C4</inf>and sum (NO<inf>3</inf>C SO<inf>2</inf>4/, of which around 60% was as NH4NO<inf>3</inf>. Distinct seasonality was also observed in the data, influenced by changes in emissions, chemical interactions, and the influence of meteorology on partitioning between the main inorganic gases and aerosol species. Springtime maxima in NH3 were attributed to the main period of manure spreading, while the peak in summer and trough in winter were linked to the influence of temperature and rainfall on emissions, deposition, and gas-aerosol-phase equilibrium. Seasonality in SO<inf>2</inf>was mainly driven by emissions (combustion), with concentrations peaking in winter, except in southern Europe, where the peak occurred in summer. Particulate SO<inf>2</inf>4 showed large peaks in concentrations in summer in southern and eastern Europe, contrasting with much smaller peaks occurring in early spring in other regions. The peaks in particulate SO<inf>2</inf>4 coincided with peaks in NH3 concentrations, attributed to the formation of the stable (NH4/2SO4. HNO<inf>3</inf>concentrations were more complex, related to traffic and industrial emissions, photochemistry, and HNO<inf>3</inf>:NH4NO<inf>3</inf>partitioning. While HNO<inf>3</inf>concentrations were seen to peak in the summer in eastern and southern Europe (increased photochemistry), the absence of a spring peak in HNO<inf>3</inf>in all regions may be explained by the depletion of HNO<inf>3</inf>through reaction with surplus NH3 to form the semi-volatile aerosol NH4NO<inf>3</inf>. Cooler, wetter conditions in early spring favour the formation and persistence of NH4NO<inf>3</inf>in the aerosol phase, consistent with the higher springtime concentrations of NH<inf>C4</inf>and NO<inf>3</inf>. The seasonal profile of NO<inf>3</inf>was mirrored by NH<inf>C4</inf>, illustrating the influence of gas-aerosol partitioning of NH4NO<inf>3</inf>in the seasonality of these components. Gas-phase NH3 and aerosol NH4NO<inf>3</inf>were the dominant species in the total inorganic gas and aerosol species measured in the NEU network. With the current and projected trends in SO<inf>2</inf>, NOx , and NH3 emissions, concentrations of NH3 and NH4NO<inf>3</inf>can be expected to continue to dominate the inorganic pollution load over the next decades, especially NH3, which is linked to substantial exceedances of ecological thresholds across Europe. The shift from (NH4/2SO4 to an atmosphere more abundant in NH4NO<inf>3</inf>is expected to maintain a larger fraction of reactive N in the gas phase by partitioning to NH3 and HNO<inf>3</inf>in warm weather, while NH4NO<inf>3</inf>continues to contribute to exceedances of air quality limits for PM2:5. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper presents and analyses a comprehensive pan-European dataset from the NitroEurope project, related to agricultural pollution, meeting all inclusion criteria.",NitroEurope (NEU) integrated project

Despite the importance of animal welfare, many such frameworks fail to adequately take account of it, mostly due to difficulties in accessing suitable data. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to develop indicators of animal welfare that can be embedded within a wider sustainability framework using a representative farm-level dataset such as the European Union (EU) Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) for Ireland, the Teagasc National Farm Survey. The paper presents a set of sustainability indicators for dairy farms in Ireland for the 2014–2017 period and examines the impact of policy reform on sustainability performance. Headline results show that welfare standards on dairy farms in Ireland have remained stable over the period despite the considerable intensification of the dairy sector following EU milk quota removal. Furthermore, dairy farms that have expanded herd size significantly have improved welfare standards more than farms that have not increased production. An analysis of synergies and trade-offs between the various aspects of sustainability reveals that positive correlations exist between welfare standards and economic and environmental performance. The analysis facilitates the identification of win-win farm-level strategies that can be adopted to improve economic, environmental and animal welfare outcomes. The framework developed here presents opportunities for evaluating policy impacts at the farm level on various aspects of sustainability. The use of the FADN demonstrates the capacity to extend such an approach across the EU. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study uses data for a single country (Ireland), which is considered national coverage and thus excluded.",

It introduced a water pricing policy in the agricultural sector that is based on a 'polluter-pays' principle. To date, some Member States have yet to comply with the pricing requirement for two main reasons: water cost estimates, as defined by the wfd , are particularly complex and difficult in the agricultural sector and farmers in marginal economic and environmental contexts may be unable to bear higher water costs. In Italy, water services are managed by regional administrations that also set irrigation water prices. This research estimated the effect of changes in irrigation water costs borne by farmers on farm incomes in a case study in the Aosta Valley Region where extensive farming is practice in a significantly naturallydisadvantage area. The analysis was modeled using four cost scenarios with economic data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (fadn ) integrated with irrigation water cost data provided by a regional administrative database. Estimated water costs averaged 2.65% and 1.06% of farm incomes, depending on the presence or absence of regional subsidies. Water costs represented higher income proportions on specialized grazing livestock farms, which is the predominant type of farming in Aosta Valley.

Consequently, there is less and less agricultural land. Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the countries whose population is decreasing from year to year, partly owing to negative natural increase and partly owing to the migrations of young people to developed western countries. However, despite the depopulation trend, there has been a significant decline in agricultural land in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. The reasons should be sought in various socio-economic processes that crucially affect spatial development. In order to understand the changes that are happening in the field, the paper analyzes the structure of agricultural land losses in B&H based on the database of the European project CORINE Land Cover. In relation to the five main land cover categories (artificial surfaces, agricultural areas, forests and semi-natural areas, wetlands and water bodies), the data show that in the period from 2000 to 2018 artificial areas increased spatial coverage, forests and semi-natural areas as well, while agricultural land decreased. The aim of the research is to identify the spatially largest changes of agricultural land subclasses into other types of land cover, in order to determine the causes and areas with the most intense pressure. This is essential given the fact that agricultural land is becoming an increasingly important natural resource over time.

This paper assesses user involvement in a diverse set of European Union (EU)-funded and non-EU (formal and informal) multi-actor partnerships. Design/methodology/approach: A review of 200 projects and other partnerships including farmers and foresters, drawn from an integrated database of several thousand such examples, assessed the types of innovation challenges tackled, solutions proposed, innovation supported, parameters of actor participation and the expectations of success in each example. Findings: All the reviewed policy instruments, not just those funded in the frame of the EIP-AGRI, can be used to involve users in co-innovation in agriculture, forestry and related value chains. Practical implications: The EIP-AGRI is just one part of a complex matrix of multi-actor co-innovation activities involving farmers and foresters in Europe. Interlinking of innovation programmes and more effective targeting of these programmes at groups of actors, especially users, who are currently not sufficiently engaged are worthy aspirations. Theoretical implications: Any analysis of co-innovation involving users must recognise the existence of a multiplicity (projects, non-project activities, formal and informal) of multi-actor approaches. Originality/value: This research used a common methodology to review several forms of multi-actor partnerships involving users and other actors.

Assessing workplace injury risk factors associated with farming is challenged by non-collection, non-reporting, or under-reporting by farmers, particularly those operating family farms in a self-employed manner. A supplementary (or add-on) farm operator (FO) workplace injury survey was undertaken in association with the Irish National Farm Survey (NFS), which is responsible for provision of Irish farm-level data to the European Commission (EC) Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Data from this add-on survey were analyzed in association with farm and socio-economic data routinely collected by NFS as a component of the FADN. The combined data-set was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques including multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for occurrence of farm operator workplace injuries (FOWI). FOWI levels were significantly higher on farms where both the FO and their spouse engaged in Off Farm Employment (OFE). More generally, FO injury levels were associated with farm workload and investment levels.

However, information about existing LTFEs is scattered, and the research data are not easily accessible. In this study, meta-information on LTFEs in Germany is compiled and their spatial representation is analyzed. The study is conducted within the framework of the BonaRes project, which, inter alia, has established a central access point for LTFE information and research data. A total of 205 LTFEs which fit to the definition above are identified. Of these, 140 LTFEs are ongoing. The land use in 168 LTFEs is arable field crops, in 34 trials grassland, in 2 trials vegetables and in 1 trial pomiculture. Field crop LTFEs are categorized into fertilization (n = 158), tillage (n = 38) and crop rotation (n = 32; multiple nominations possible) experiments, while all grassland experiments (n = 34) deal with fertilization. The spatial representation is analyzed according to the climatic water balance of the growing season (1 May to 31 October) (CWBg), the Müncheberg Soil Quality Rating (MSQR) and clay content. The results show that, in general, the LTFEs well represent the area shares of both the CWBg and the MSQR classes. Eighty-nine percent of the arable land and 65% of the grassland in Germany are covered by the three driest CWBg classes, hosting 89% and 71% of the arable and grassland LTFEs, respectively. LTFEs cover all six MSQR classes but with a bias towards the high and very high soil quality classes. LTFEs on arable land are present in all clay content classes according to the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) but with a bias towards the clay content class 4. Grassland LTFEs show a bias towards the clay content classes 5, 6 and 7, while well representing the other clay content classes, except clay content class 3, where grassland LTFEs are completely missing. The results confirm the very high potential of LTFE data for spatially differentiated analyses and modeling. However, reuse is restricted by the difficult access to LTFE research data.

A sector of the economy where the implications of the credit crunch have not been thoroughly studied is the agriculture. This is surprising given the importance of agriculture for the European economy. We focus on agriculture in fourteen European Union (EU) Member States in the aftermath of the credit crunch. To this end, we employ the micro-econometric data set of Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) of EU at NUTS 2 level. From a methodological point of view, we model agriculture investment based on a flexible panel Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model that provides impulse response functions (IRFs) and variance decompositions (VDCs).

As its origin story and initial encounter, Central Asia offers a prismatic lens to delve into the vital impacts and significant changes wrought by the BRI. In the dryland region, the BRI impact on watersheds and agriculture is a critical challenge with direct implications for food security. Framed by diverse research sources, we utilized spatial datasets from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative and the World Bank to explore the intersection of food production, water and development. Investigation evaluates the possible trade-offs that Chinese infrastructure investment can have on the communities and environment of Central Asia. The findings identify more than 15,000 km of rail and 20,000 km of roads linked to the BRI crisscrossing the region in 2018. Whilst these transport corridors have improved connectivity, many of these rails and roads traverse important agricultural and water zones, creating undetermined risks and opportunities. Land use change was examined within a 10-km buffer around BRI roads and rails from 2008 to 2018. Railways increased by 23% during this time, yet irrigated and rainfed agriculture decreased whilst urban areas markedly expanded. Contextual research identifies how Chinese policies may encourage agribusiness investment for food exports as possible disruptions to national and regional food supply. However, to date Central Asia provides <1% of Chinese agricultural imports. In fact, Afghanistan is the region’s dominant export market, tripling agricultural imports >300% in this time. Similarly, five times more livestock are traded within the region than to China. Evaluating infrastructure change is essential to understand BRI impacts on environments and societies, with the food-water nexus a particular concern in Central Asia.

10.1016/j.still.2020.104720,The new assessment of soil erodibility in Greece,"N., Efthimiou, Nikolaos",2020,"Erodibility designates soils' vulnerability to the abrading effect of erosion's climatic drivers i.e. precipitation and overland flow. This parameter is represented in the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its successor (RUSLE), by the respective component (K-factor). Its accurate quantification is critical for modelling soil erosion. Yet, in many countries – Greece included – the process is hindered by the lack of high-quality field observations, evenly distributed in time and space. In light of the above, the study aims to develop the new soil erodibility map of Greece. The K-factor was calculated using the algebraic expression of the Wischmeier and Smith (1978) nomograph. The latter considers basic soil properties like granulometry, soil organic matter content, structure and permeability. Approximately 2800 soil samples were utilized, deriving from the European Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) and the Greek National Agricultural Research Foundation (NAGREF) databases. Of them, 577 corresponded to croplands and 2113 to forests/rangeland. Erodibility was spatially interpolated utilizing the ordinary cokriging methodology. The mean nationwide value was estimated at 0.024 t ha h ha−1 MJ−1 mm−1, ranging from 0.013−0.044 t ha h ha−1 MJ−1 mm−1. After incorporating the surface stone cover effect, given the country's extensive coverage, mean K-factor value was reduced by 22 %, at 0.018 t ha h ha–1 MJ–1 mm–1. The new maps (500 m resolution) improve the accuracy of the available K-factor delineation, developed by the EU at pan-European level. The sample network is denser (1 sample per 48 km2) and more evenly distributed throughout the Greek territory. Also, the geostatistical model was fitted focusing entirely on the specific attributes of Greece.

We evaluate optical data from Landsat 8 in both the dry and wet season for three study areas in the Caucasus. We test the performance of four different optical water indices derived from Landsat data, a method by Zou et al.

In response, the German federal state of Saxony combined the instrument of management plans with AEPs to support the implementation of the Habitat Directive. In this study, we investigate the determinants of a farmers’ decisions to adjust their farming practices. Our data set consists of a quantitative survey with 131 farmers conducted between 2004 and 2011, complemented by implementation data from 333 grassland-plots. Determinants of farmers’ decisions to conserve grassland were estimated using a multinomial logit model. Our results show that a combination of management plans and AEPs can increase farmers’ disposition to adopt nature conservation measures. As central determinants, structural and location factors as well as the complementary provisiion of specifically designed AEPs increase farmers’ willingness to adopt conservation practices for grassland management. It can be concluded that additional costs are a major barrier to farmers’ adoption, particularly to those farms directing their farm management towards the optimisation of productivity and profitability .

Tall tower based monitoring stations are relatively rare, but provide important information about the carbon balance of a larger region surrounding the tower. In this study we report and analyze the 21-year-long dataset provided by the Hungarian tall tower site, Hegyhátsál. The daily and annual cycles of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production, and total ecosystem respiration are presented. Footprint analysis reveals that the fluxes mostly originate from the surrounding arable lands; the main source region is located within 1 km around the tower. Long-term, mean NEE was -0.467 gC m-2 day-1, or -170 gC m-2 year-1, revealing that the complex region was a net carbon sink from the atmospheric perspective. Trend analysis indicates that overall, NEE decreased (i.e. became more negative, which means stronger sink) by 12 gC m-2 year-1, a trend that is explained by improved agrotechnology and climate change. Net biome production (NBP) was estimated using crop census data and assumptions about the management practices that affect lateral carbon flux. Long term mean NBP was -30 gC m-2 year-1, which indicates that the soils may be losing carbon, though this loss is within the range of uncertainty of the measurements (~50 gC m-2 year-1). Analysis of county-scale yield statistics suggested that the results can be representative to at least county scale (1651 km2). Interannual variability was analyzed by using environmental variables such as maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure deficit, soil water content, and satellite based vegetation index aggregated at monthly and longer time intervals. The results indicate that environmental conditions in spring have a major role in the annual carbon balance. Moreover, water availability represented by soil water content rather than by precipitation is a major driver of the interannual variability of NEE. The statistical analysis suggested that the large positive NEE anomaly during 2001–2003 was caused by interplay among the environmental drivers, in particular maximum temperature, vapor pressure deficit and radiation in April, followed by a soil water content deficit during the growing season. This novel statistical analysis provides insight into the drivers of the carbon balance of a mixed agricultural region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The dataset is from a single site in Hungary, which constitutes local/national coverage, not European.",

Therefore, we perform a structural decomposition analysis based on the recently released EXIOBASE 3 database to examine in depth how changes in water input coefficients, in final demand and in technology have affected changes in water use across crops. Crop production consumes 99% of the direct water in agriculture. Our results show that the largest EU crop producers have experienced an increase in water use that is mostly driven by changes in technology. On the other hand, several Mediterranean countries, where water scarcity has been a problem for years, have decreased their water consumption mostly thanks to an improvement in their water intensity.

However, it still faces challenges in terms of its application. This research responds to the need for integrating a geographical information system (GIS) tool into the tLCA framework, which has not yet been operationalised in the framework. This article aims to contribute to harmonising the link between tLCA and GIS at the inventory phase. In specific, we propose to introduce the concept of “territorial Emission Factor (tEF)” in the inventory phase of the current tLCA framework so that emissions can be calculated directly from land-use planning, which can be expressed as spatial data using GIS. A case study of maize land use in the Walloon region (South region in Belgium) is implemented to prove the concept for agricultural territories. Besides the benefit of linking GIS in tLCA, the results show that tEF can serve as an informative indicator, revealing territorial differences and identify hotspots in input inventory. The case study calculates tEF at the subnational level using open-access data, which shows one possibility to discriminate tEF for European countries. The data selection for the case study is mainly based on an analysis of the methods and data sources used in the existing life cycle inventory databases for the agricultural sector. This practice contributes to increasing transparency and comparability of the results. It reveals a possibility to fill the data gap with existing open-access data when the inventory for the agricultural territory at subnational is not available. In sum, this study 1) develops the concept of tEF to facilitate tLCA operationalisation with GIS 2) conducts a case study to demonstrate the utilisation of tEF in tLCA, and 3) explores the possibility of discriminating tEF over European countries for agricultural sector through open-access data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper discusses using open-access data to develop territorial emission factors for the agricultural sector across European countries, meeting all inclusion criteria.",

In this study, we assessed the patterns of co-occurrence of rare and threatened arable plants in 106 plots of winter arable vegetation located from Piedmont to Calabria, in the mainland part of the country. For this purpose, we based our investigation on the analysis of a recently acquired dataset and on the European list of rare and threatened arable plants. We highlight how different species of conservation interest tend to occur in the same community. On the other hand, generalist and more competitive taxa show similar patterns of co-occurrence.

Users may not be aware that data pertaining to the same fragment of land (in aspect of geometry or description attributes), but acquired from different sources do not always adequately reflect reality. After Poland's accession to the European Union, the EU Member States have undertaken to develop a Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) as part of the Integrated Administration and Control System in every country. The information aggregated by that system supports the payment of area-based subsidies, monitoring farmers' cross-compliance with selected environmental rules and the implementation of rural development programs. The LPIS was developed by compiling data from various sources, including the Cadastral Register (CR). The LPIS database is continuously modified to account for changes in the use of agricultural land. However, not all users are aware of these changes, and they regard LPIS data as identical to CR data. The above can breed conflict and legal complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which the reference data from the CR are modified in the LPIS. The CR was selected for this analysis because it is widely used for various purposes, including urban planning, calculation of taxes and public statistics. Geographic and descriptive data were analyzed, and the relationships between both data bases were determined (more than 12,000 elements were measured). The extent to which primary data were modified was expressed with the use of an indicator describing the percentage change in cadastral data. The study concerned geometry (I<inf>g</inf>), described parameters (I<inf>d</inf>) and the cumulative index (I<inf>c</inf>) of the examined objects.

Indeed, over the years, the intensification of production through excessive or inappropriate use of pesticides and fertilisers in the agricultural sector has had a negative impact on natural resources. This negative environment impact has had both minor and major consequences for the natural resources present in the different areas of the European Union (EU). This variability depends mainly on the different agricultural training of farmers and on their ability to practise sustainable agriculture. Hence, with a specific set of agri-environmental indicators provided by the Eurostat database, this paper analyses the spatial and temporal variation of the agricultural land-use practices and the related environmental effects in EU countries. In pursuit of this aim, descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis (factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis) were adopted to determine the similarities/dissimilarities between the different types of agricultural production in the EU and the dominant dimensions of agricultural production and activities there in terms of their impact of natural resources in order to identify “homogeneity” among member states. The main contribution of this paper lies, above all, in the fact that the classification of these countries in four agro-ecosystems, with similar use of energy, pollution factors, and natural resources, could be useful as a tool for policymakers. Importantly, it could help them to define different incentives that could encourage farmers to adopt more sustainable agricultural production methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses the Eurostat database to analyze agricultural practices across EU countries, which meets all inclusion criteria.",Eurostat

Anthelmintic Resistance (AR) in parasites is now widespread throughout Europe, although there are still gaps in our knowledge in some regions and countries. AR is a major threat to the sustainability of modern ruminant livestock production, resulting in reduced productivity, compromised animal health and welfare, and increased greenhouse gas emissions through increased parasitism and farm inputs. A better understanding of the extent of AR in Europe is needed to develop and advocate more sustainable parasite control approaches. A database of European published and unpublished AR research on gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) and liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) was collated by members of the European COST Action ""COMBAR""(Combatting Anthelmintic Resistance in Ruminants), and combined with data from a previous systematic review of AR in GIN. A total of 197 publications on AR in GIN were available for analysis, representing 535 studies in 22 countries and spanning the period 1980-2020. Reports of AR were present throughout the European continent and some reports indicated high within-country prevalence. Heuristic sample size-weighted estimates of European AR prevalence over the whole study period, stratified by anthelmintic class, varied between 0 and 48%. Estimated regional (country) prevalence was highly heterogeneous, ranging between 0% and 100% depending on livestock sector and anthelmintic class, and generally increased with increasing research effort in a country. In the few countries with adequate longitudinal data, there was a tendency towards increasing AR over time for all anthelmintic classes in GIN: aggregated results in sheep and goats since 2010 reveal an average prevalence of resistance to benzimidazoles (BZ) of 86%, macrocyclic lactones except moxidectin (ML) 52%, levamisole (LEV) 48%, and moxidectin (MOX) 21%. All major GIN genera survived treatment in various studies.

Hence, it is essential to continuously enhance the data quality and spatial completeness to satisfy the increasing scientific research requirements. In this study, we explore the potential possibility of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) datasets in filling the gaps of ECV SM. The comprehensive assessment results show that: (1) The data missing percent of gap-filled ECV decreases 20% on average, which can be one step closer to generate a seamlessly covered global land surface SM product with favorable quality. (2) Compared to the original ECV, the gap-filled ECV products express similar good response to the in-situ measurements, suggesting that the SMAP SM products could be taken to efficiently fill the gaps and consistently maintain favorable accuracy at the same time. (3) Compared to the in-situ measurements, the original ECV SM products demonstrate extremely high probability density peak percentages. Fortunately, this eminent high value could be effectively rectified through gap-filling progress using SMAP. Overall, this study conducts objective and detailed evaluation on the performance of applying SMAP to fill the gaps of ECV, and is expected to act as a valuable reference in ECV SM gap-filling method. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The datasets used (ECV SM from ESA and SMAP from NASA) are global products, not exclusively European, even though the case study is focused on Europe.",

Here, we report the first draft genome sequence of ‘Ca. Phytoplasma pini’ strain MDPP, which consists of 474,136 bases, with a G + C content of 22.22%. This information will facilitate comparative genomics of gymnosperm-infecting phytoplasmas. Phytoplasmas are bacterial plant pathogens that lack a cell wall and inhabit plant phloem tissue. Phytoplasmas cause a wide variety of symptoms such as yellowing, stunting, witches’brooms, phyllody, virescence, and little leaves. The mode of transmission for phytoplasmas from plant to plant is by insect vectors (Weintraub and Beanland 2006). Currently, more than 1,000 plant species have been described as host plants of phytoplasmas, including many agriculturally important crops (Bertaccini et al. 2014; Seemüller et al. 2013). Due to the lack of in vitro culture, available genome sequences of phytoplasmas are limited. Currently, the molecular characterization and classification is mainly based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence (IRPCM 2004; Lee et al. 1998; Wei et al. 2007). In April 2015, we identified a new ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pini’related strain from a pine tree located in a wooded area in Laurel, MD (Costanzo et al. 2016). This pine tree had excessive shoot branching, resulting in a witches’-broom phenotype. The strain was designated MDPP. Here, we report the first draft genome sequence of the strain MDPP, providing a resource for comparative genomics of gymnosperm-infecting phytoplasmas present in Europe and North America. Genomic DNA of strain MDPP was extracted from symptomatic pine needles using the DNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, U.S.A.). The pathogen titer level was estimated using 23S rRNA-based real-time quantitative PCR, giving a threshold cycle value of 18.66 per 2 ml of total infected plant DNA (Hodgetts et al. 2009). Bacterial DNA was enriched using the NEBNext microbiome DNA enrichment kit (New England Biolabs., Ipswich, MA, U.S.A.) that was further amplified using the REPLI-g Mini Kit (Qiagen). The 2 × 300-bp Illumina paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.). The paired-end sequencing libraries were prepared using an Illumina TruSeq PCR free DNA library prep kit. The DNA was fragmented using a Covaris M220 with an average size of 550 bp. In total, 5.17 × 107 reads with a mean of 269 bp/read were generated from MiSeq sequencing. These paired-end reads were aligned using bowtie2 (version 2.2.5) (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) to the Pinus taeda genome (loblolly pine) APFE000000000.3 and P. lambertiana genome (sugar pine) LMTP000000000.1. The resulting unmapped reads (31,810,002) were merged and used in de novo assembly using the SPAdes assembler (version 3.11.0) (Nurk et al. 2013) with a kmer of 51. The resulting contigs were screened for phytoplasma origin using blastx against nr and against 9 complete and 23 draft phytoplasma genomes available from the genomes database of NCBI. This generated 16 contigs that were well aligned with known phytoplasmas. The contigs ranged from 6,925 to 110,223 bp (N<inf>50</inf> = 40,003), corresponding to 55,309 reads of phytoplasma origin. The contigs comprised a total length of 474,136 bp, with a G + C content of 22.22% and an average coverage of 28×.

The dataset was derived from 54 references with a total of 750 comparisons and included site characteristics, crop information (diversification system, crop production, tillage and fertilization management) and soil parameters. We analyzed each effect separately, comparing CP under tillage management (e.g., conventional tillage vs. no tillage), crop diversification (e.g., monoculture vs. rotation), and fertilization management (e.g., mineral fertilization vs. organic fertilization). Compared with conventional tillage (CT), CP was higher by 12% in no tillage (NT), in fine- and medium-textured soils (8–9%) and in arid and semiarid sites located in the Mediterranean Region (24%). Compared to monoculture, diversified cropping systems with longer crop rotations increased CP by 12%, and by 12% in soils with coarse and medium textures. In relation to fertilization, CP was increased with the use of slurry (40%), and when crop residues were incorporated (39%) or mulched (74%). Results showed that conversion to alternative diversified systems through the use of crop rotations, with NT and organic fertilization, results in a better crop performance.

Assessing the distribution and extent of such farmlands is useful for appropriate targeting of conservation measures and supporting associated rural communities. The conservation of species and habitats within HNVf is also among the aims of the EU's (European Union) Biodiversity Strategy and is a focus of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Rural Development Programme. Data on HNVf distribution and extent is required for both policy implementations under the CAP for income support payments and reporting within the EU Biodiversity strategy. Here, we extend the scope of the methodology from a previous study by presenting a finer spatial resolution to map the likely distribution of HNVf in the Republic of Ireland using indicators adapted for the Irish context and weighted based on expert knowledge and literature. The indicators (and weighting) used were: semi-natural habitat cover (40%, from CORINE land cover), stocking density (30%, from Land Parcel Information System; LPIS), hedgerow/scrub cover (10%), river and stream density (10%), and soil diversity (10%). Indicators were included in a weighted sum model (WSM) that combined raster indicator inputs, representing relative weights and the output had a tetrad-scale (2 km × 2 km) resolution. We used various datasets (national nature designations, Irish semi-natural grasslands survey, intensive farmland points and field points with semi-natural habitats) to validate the final HNVf map. To do this, all datasets were converted from polygon to point data format by considering the centroid of the polygon as the data point and overlaid on the HNVf map to assess the possible incidence. Of the 13,660 tetrads defined as farmland in the analysis, 4602 (33.7%) had a high or very high likelihood of being HNVf. About 54% of the latter set of tetrads partly or wholly coincided with Natura 2000 sites; about 84% partly or wholly coincided with NPWS priority areas for conservation of biodiversity in agri-environment schemes, and about 53% were in upland areas (>150 m a.s.l.). Validation data representing extensive farmland systems had an increasing incidence in tetrads with higher values (HNVf likelihood); the opposite was true for validation data representing intensive farmland. The final output was combined with the NPWS priority areas for farmland biodiversity conservation because the latter represented Type 3 HNV that is poorly represented by our method (which best represents Type 1 HNV). To our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive method to estimate and validate the extent and distribution of HNVf in the Republic of Ireland. It indicates that a substantially higher proportion of the country is likely to comprise HNVf than previously estimated, and large areas of HNVf occur outside the Natura 2000 network, and in lowland areas. Improved knowledge of the distribution and extent of HNVf provides a valuable tool to help improve the decision-making process for policy targeting, implementation and monitoring of HNVf.

Water accounting, that is a standardized documentation of data on water resources, is a useful tool to provide this information. Pan-European data on climate impacts do not recognize local anthropogenic interventions in the water cycle. Most European river basins have a specific toolset that is understood and used by local experts and stakeholders. However, these local tools are not versatile. Thus, there is a need for a common approach that can be understood by multi-fold users to quantify impact indicators based on local data and that can be used to synthesize information at the European level. Then, policies can be designed with the confidence that underlying data are backed-up by local context and expert knowledge. This work presents a simplified water accounting framework that allows for a standardized examination of climate impacts on water resource availability and use across multiple basins. The framework is applied to five different river basins across Europe.

In Nakhon Si Thammarat, a southern province in Thailand, flooding is a recurrent event affecting the entire province, especially the urban area. Every year, it causes lives and damages to infrastructure, agricultural production and severely affects local economic development. In order to monitor and estimate flood damages in near-real time, numerous techniques can be used, from a simply digitizing on maps, to using detailed surveys or remote sensing techniques. However, when using the last-mentioned technique, the results are conditioned by the time of data acquisition (day or night) as well as by weather conditions.

The identification and quantification of the drivers of LULCC are crucial for improving our understanding of LULCC trends. So far, the biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of forest change have not been quantified at the regional scale, particularly for SSEA. In this study, we quantify the biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of forest change on a country-by-country basis in SSEA using an integrated quantitative methodology, which systematically accounts for previously published driver information and regional datasets. We synthesize more than 200 publications to identify the drivers of the forest change at different spatial scales in SSEA. Subsequently, we collect spatially explicit proxy data to represent the identified drivers. We quantify the dynamics of forest and agricultural land from 1992 to 2015 using the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) land cover data developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). A geographically weighted regression method is employed to quantify the spatially heterogeneous drivers of forest change. Our results show that socioeconomic drivers are more important than biophysical drivers for the conversion of forest to agricultural land in South Asia and maritime Southeast Asia. In contrast, biophysical drivers are more important than socioeconomic drivers for the conversion of agricultural land to forest in maritime Southeast Asia and less important in South Asia.

High BOD loadings to freshwater systems are mainly coming from anthropogenic sources, comprising domestic and livestock waste, industrial emissions, and combined sewer overflows. We developed a conceptual model (GREEN + <inf>BOD</inf> ) to assess mean annual current organic pollution (BOD fluxes) across Europe. The model was informed with the latest available European datasets of domestic and industrial emissions, population and livestock densities. Model parameters were calibrated using 2008–2012 mean annual BOD concentrations measured in 2157 European monitoring stations, and validated with other 1134 stations. The most sensitive model parameters were abatement of BOD by secondary treatment and the BOD decay exponent of travel time. The mean BOD concentrations measured in monitored stations was 2.10 mg O <inf>2</inf> /L and predicted concentrations were 2.54 mg O <inf>2</inf> /L; the 90th percentile of monitored BOD concentration was 3.51 mg O <inf>2</inf> /L while the predicted one was 4.76 mg O <inf>2</inf> /L.

To answer this question, a spatial approach is suggested, namely an approach that considers geography as a factor in measuring the success of such policy. A geographical approach can be used to pinpoint “hotspots” in order to determine an appropriate distribution of funds. To implement such an approach to the distribution of EU funding, a Spatial Fuzzy Partitioning Around Medoids (SFPAM) analysis is advocated. The contribution of this research is that it combines a temporal dimension within an explicitly spatial approach. It achieves this by using a dataset that includes both geographical and economic factors such as farm sizes, their management, the number of organic farms involved, the agriculture area invested by the AEM and the size of the workforce involved. Its strategy is the identification of medoids which are represented by a specific municipality. This allows the identification of aggregated neighborhoods for the visualization of AEM outcomes based on a fuzzy partitioning method.

Measurements of soil moisture at regional scales have traditionally been sparse, but advances in land surface modelling and the development of satellite technology to indirectly measure surface soil moisture has led to the emergence of a number of national and global soil moisture data sets that can provide insight into the dynamics of agricultural drought. Droughts are often defined by normal conditions for a given time and place; as a result, data sets used to quantify drought need a representative baseline of conditions in order to accurately establish a normal. This presents a challenge when working with earth observation data sets which often have very short baselines for a single instrument. This study assessed three soil moisture data sets: a surface satellite soil moisture data set from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission operating since 2010; a blended surface satellite soil moisture data set from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) that has a long history and a surface and root zone soil moisture data set from the Canadian Meteorology Centre (CMC)'s Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS). An iterative chi-squared statistical routine was used to evaluate each data set's sensitivity to canola yields in Saskatchewan, Canada. The surface soil moisture from all three data sets showed a similar temporal trend related to crop yields, showing a negative impact on canola yields when soil moisture exceeded a threshold in May and June. The strength and timing of this relationship varied with the accuracy and statistical properties of the data set, with the SMOS data set showing the strongest relationship (peak X2 = 170 for Day of Year 145), followed by the ESA-CCI (peak X2 = 89 on Day of Year 129) and then the RDPS (peak X2 = 65 on Day of Year 129). Using short baseline soil moisture data sets can produce consistent results compared to using a longer data set, but the characteristics of the years used for the baseline are important. Soil moisture baselines of 18-20 years or more are needed to reliably estimate the relationship between high soil moisture and high yielding years. For the relationship between low soil moisture and low yielding years, a shorter baseline can be used, with reliable results obtained when 10-15 years of data are available, but with reasonably consistent results obtained with as few as 7 years of data. This suggests that the negative impacts of drought on agriculture may be reliably estimated with a relatively short baseline of data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study's geographical focus is Canada, which violates the European coverage criterion.",

We used annual and seasonal spectral-temporal metrics and environmental features to map 12 land cover and land use classes across Europe. The spectral-temporal metrics provided an efficient means to capture seasonal variations of land surface spectra and to reduce the impact of clouds and cloud-shadows by relaxing the otherwise strong cloud cover limitations imposed by image-based classification methods. The best classification model was based on Landsat-8 data from three years (2014–2016) and achieved an accuracy of 75.1%, nearly 2 percentage points higher than the classification model based on a single year of Landsat data (2015). Our results indicate that annual pan-European land cover maps are feasible, but that temporally dynamic classes like artificial land, cropland, and grassland still benefit from more frequent satellite observations. The produced pan-European land cover map compared favorably to the existing CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) 2012 land cover dataset. The mapped country-wide area proportions strongly correlated with LUCAS-estimated area proportions (r = 0.98). Differences between mapped and LUCAS sample-based area estimates were highest for broadleaved forest (map area was 9% higher). Grassland and seasonal cropland areas were 7% higher than the LUCAS estimate, respectively. In comparison, the correlation between LUCAS and CORINE area proportions was weaker (r = 0.84) and varied strongly by country. CORINE substantially overestimated seasonal croplands by 63% and underestimated grassland proportions by 37%.

Organic agriculture, including food, (hereinafter - agri-food) production shows considerable growth on the global and European Union (EU) level, including Latvia. It has been widely considered by scholars, experts and politicians that organic agri-food production is beneficial for rural development through: enhanced entrepreneur activities; growth of jobs; creation of added value and alternative food chains; and, especially, increase well-being for rural inhabitants. Besides, organic farming generates environmental and socio-economic benefits to society and provides various ecosystem services (e.g., landscape, biodiversity). The aim of the study is twofold: 1) to assess the latest development trends and issues of organic agri-food production, as well as its spatial aspects; 2) to evaluate the support to organic agri-food by the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-20120. The principal materials used in the studies are as follows: different sources of literature, e.g., scholars’ articles, research papers and the reports of institutions, as well as EU and Latvia’s legislation. The data have been obtained from: Eurostat online database, online database of Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia, Food and Veterinary Service and unpublished data from the Latvian Rural Support Service. The appropriate qualitative and quantitative research methods for certain tasks have been used in the process of study: monographic; content analysis and synthesis; logical and abstract construction; data grouping; correlation and linear regression etc. Although the number of organic holdings and utilized agricultural area (UAA) under organic farming is high in Latvia, the agricultural production share or output is almost negligible. Only one organic product - honey has high share 30% from total production volume. Either organic food processors and processed food share from total food is negligible compared to the number of organic farms and share of organic land. There are some limitations, which hinder further development of organic agriculture in Latvia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The geographical scope is national (Latvia), not pan-European.",

The 2013 CAP reform introduced several new measures. In budgetary terms, basic payment and greening were the most significant ones. Besides, coupled supports, young farmer and small farmers scheme should be mentioned. To reveal the changes caused by these measures, the time horizon of the study is 2013-2017. Since the subsidies represent a significant part of the income generated in the agricultural sector, the basic hypothesis of the study is that the production units concerned (individual farms, private enterprises) gave economically rational answers. In practice, this means trying to fully adapt to the changes to maximize support. Based on the analysed datasets (Hungarian Central Statistical Office and Hungarian State Treasury), it became evident that farmers responded rationally: splitting up farms against capping, moving towards the lowest resistance to comply with greening, plus associating them with the extra support of coupled payments. Generational renewal is a key issue; however, the present form of young farmers scheme needs to be refined to be more effective. Small farmers scheme is a good opportunity for farmers with less than 5.5 ha and most of the concerned farmers chose well. However, there are about 6,000 farms that are too small for the standard system, while 772 farms that are too large for the small farmers scheme. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The geographical scope is national (Hungary), not pan-European.",

The precipitation data is obtained from the European Climate Assessment and Dataset project for the period 1961-2014, for 8 meteorological stations in northern Serbia, 5 in Hungary and 1 in eastern Croatia. The extreme values of precipitation were calculated following the indices developed by the ETCCDI. RclimDex software package was used for indices calculation. Based on statistical analysis and the calculated values, the results have been presented with Geographic Information System (GIS) to point out the most vulnerable parts of the Pannonian basin, with regard to pluvial erosion. This study presents the first result of combined rainfall erosivity and extreme precipitation indices for the investigated area. Results of PCI indicate presence of moderate precipitation concentration (mean value 11.6). Trend analysis of FI (mean value 22.7) and MFI (mean value 70.2) implies a shift from being largely in the low erosivity class, to being completely in the moderate erosivity class in the future, thus indicating an increase in rainfall erosivity for most of the investigated area (except in the northwestern parts). Furthermore, the observed precipitation extremes suggest that both the amount and the intensity of precipitation are increasing. The knowledge about the areas affected by strong soil erosion could lead to introducing effective measures in order to reduce it.

Grower magazines and wine journals have reported the renaissance of neglected and even threatened grape cultivars, raising awareness and promoting their cultivation by vine-growers. Minor cultivars represent huge value with respect to cultural heritage, adaptation to ecological conditions, diversification of products and marketing of specialities with a higher economic benefit. Recognizing the heritage and value of traditional crop genetic diversity maintained on farms, in 2017, the European Cooperative Program for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR) published a “Concept for on-farm conservation and management of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture”. ECPGR described a future strategy for the preservation of genetic resources. Priority actions defined are transmissible to grapevine. They encompass the development of descriptors, inventory of on-farm vineyards, definition of threat categories and overcoming of legal obstacles, ensuring that obsolete cultivars can be grown. Focus on these four issues took place under the scope of the ECPGR grant scheme activity “On-farm inventory of minor grape varieties in the European Vitis Database” in 2017. Twelve researchers from ten countries (Albania, Austria, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Montenegro, Portugal, Serbia, Spain) participated. Descriptors were selected for the grower (12 descriptors), cultivar preserved (17 descriptors), vineyard description (17 descriptors) and commitments (six descriptors). To date, 191 vineyards have been registered: in Spain (105), Albania (16), Montenegro (14), Croatia (13), Germany (13), France (17), Portugal (5), Serbia (5) and Austria (3). An on-farm database was developed (http://www.eu-vitis.de/onfarm/index.php). Criteria for four threat categories were defined and used to initiate a process for legal inclusion of rare historical cultivars in national cultivar catalogues.

Among agricultural landscapes, vineyards are responsible for the highest erosion rates, particularly in steep-slope landscapes. The impact of vineyard mechanisation on soil loss is only marginally explored in published literature. This study provides an estimation of the annual soil loss rate by application of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in 24 terraced vineyards located in north-eastern Italy. Field observations showed that 13 vineyards consisted of fully mechanised fields, 5 vineyards had no form of mechanisation, while in 6 vineyards a mixture of practices was found. Soil erodibility (K factor) was derived for these practices (based on soil characteristics and varying degrees of compaction), while slope length and steepness (LS factors) were calculated from a 1-m LiDAR-based DTM, and remaining factors were based on datasets by the European Soil Data Centre. Mechanised fields showed 29% higher erosion rates than non-mechanised fields (respectively 53.9 and 69.5 t ha-1 y-1), although this is not statistically significant. Still, the direct impact of mechanisation is underestimated in this comparison, due to the predominant steep slopes in the manually cultivated fields. Furthermore, estimated soil loss from mechanised fields in addition to mechanised paths and roads is significantly higher by 37% than non-mechanised fields. This study thus offers an indication of how machinery and related soil compaction and transformation of terraces and infrastructure, increases soil loss risk. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The geographical scope of the study is national (Italy), not pan-European.",

In this paper, we used the latest global land cover data published by the European Space Agency (ESA) to investigate spatiotemporal variation characteristics of forest cover in developing countries from 1992 to 2015, and then analyzed causal factors of this variation using a binary logistic regression model. Existing studies on FT are mostly based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); this study improves our understanding of FT mechanisms through the use of a new dataset. The results indicate that the forest area in developing countries decreased from 21.8 to 21.3 million km2 from 1992-2015, and the rate of decline slowed after 2004. South America suffered the largest reduction in forest area (505,100 km2), whereas forest area in Africa increased slightly. By 2015, more than 80% of African countries had experienced FT, whereas only half of developing countries experienced forest expansion in South America. The variables affecting FT occurrence differed among continents. On the global scale, the remaining forest coverage and the proportion of forest exports negatively affected the likelihood of FT occurrence, whereas urbanization level had a positive effect. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study's geographical focus is on developing countries, not Europe.",

This study intercompares total aerosol optical depth (AOD) and dust AOD (DAOD) from two global reanalyses datasets, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) and the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research-2 (MERRA-2). These are evaluated against AeroSpan (Aerosol characterisation via Sun photometry: Australian Network) ground observations which forms part of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) over the Australian continent for the 2002–2012 period. During dust storms, AeroSpan/AERONET AOD measurements were missing due to cloud screening. To overcome validation limitations in sun photometry for dust events, a nephelometer's scattering coefficient is qualitatively compared against reanalysis of DAOD at a key dust storm activation site, Tinga Tingana in South Australia (~200 km east of Lake Eyre). A specific extreme event that occurred in 2009 originating from the Lake Eyre basin, a major dust source covering one-sixth of Australia, was studied. The results show that MERRA-2 reanalysis overestimates monthly total AOD twice as much compared to AeroSpan/AERONET ground observations but seems better correlated against AeroSpan/AERONET than ECMWF/MACC. Mean data of MERRA-2 time series over 10 years provide lower DAOD values and lower dust aerosol estimates than ECMWF/MACC reanalysis (over the Lake Eyre basin with spatial averaging). Specifically at Tinga Tingana, the correlation from MERRA-2 (0.45 correlation) and ECMWF/MACC (0.43 correlation) against AeroSpan/AERONET's AOD were similar. Between MERRA-2 and ECMWF/MACC decade long daily gridded DAOD, the correlation coefficient was high at 0.73, again indicating similarity between the datasets. MERRA-2 total AOD correlation is significantly higher (by 0.26) against AeroSpan/AERONET than ECMWF/MACC. MERRA-2 also provides higher AOD values in extreme cases which may correspond to dust storms. During dust storms, a hybrid strategy using nephelometers and hourly reanalysis from MERRA-2 is able to identify dust storms better than AeroSpan/AERONET.

A total of 114 nations (58% of the total nations in the world) and two international organizations, including the European Union (EU) and Codex (WHO) have regulated at least one of the most currently used pesticides in at least one of the most consumed agricultural commodities. In this study, 14 of the most commonly used pesticides and 12 of the most commonly consumed agricultural commodities were identified and selected for analysis. A health risk analysis indicated that nearly 30% of the computed pesticide TMDI values were greater than the acceptable daily intake (ADI) values; however, many nations lack common pesticide MRLs in many commonly consumed foods and other human exposure pathways, such as soil, water, and air were not considered. Normality tests of the TMDI values set indicated that all distributions had a right skewness due to large TMDI clusters at the low end of the distribution, which were caused by some strict pesticide MRLs regulated by the EU (normally a default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg when essential data are missing). The Box-Cox transformation and optimal lambda (λ) were applied to these TMDI distributions, and normality tests of the transformed data set indicated that the power transformed TMDI values of at least eight pesticides presented a normal distribution. It was concluded that unifying strict pesticide MRLs by nations worldwide could significantly skew the distribution of TMDI values to the right, lower the legal exposure to pesticide, and effectively control human health risks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study has a global scope, not exclusively European.",

In this context, soil spectroscopy is a well-consolidated and widespread method to estimate soil variables, and in particular SOC content, at a low cost for routine analysis. The increasing number of large soil spectral libraries collected worldwide reflects the importance of spectroscopy in soil science. These large libraries contain soil samples derived from a large number of pedological regions and thus from different parent materials and soil types. In the light of the huge variation in the spectral responses to SOC content and composition, a rigorous process is necessary to subdivide large spectral libraries to avoid calibration with global models that fail to predict local variation in SOC content. Here, we propose to classify the European LUCAS topsoil database with a cluster analysis based on a large number of soil properties. The soil samples collected from arable land in the LUCAS database were chosen to apply a standardized multivariate calibration approach, valid for large areas, to calibrate local models without the need for further field and laboratory work. Cluster analysis detected seven soil classes and the samples belonging to each class were used to calibrate specific partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to estimate SOC content in three spectral libraries collected in Belgium and Luxembourg. Soil organic carbon was predicted with good accuracy, both within each library (root mean square error (RMSE), 1.2–5.1 g kg−1; ratio of performance to prediction (RPD), 1.41–2.24) and for the samples of the three libraries together (RMSE, 3.7 g kg−1; RPD, 2.54). The proposed approach could enable SOC to be estimated for arable soils in Europe with only the spectra of soil samples and without the need for laboratory analyses. Highlights: We investigated the potential of the LUCAS database to estimate SOC in spectral libraries. We proposed a routine approach to estimate SOC with less laboratory work. The classification of the LUCAS topsoil dataset improved estimation accuracy of SOC SOC content can be predicted from soil spectra with models calibrated on the LUCAS database. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The paper uses a European dataset (LUCAS) to study an agricultural topic across multiple European countries (Belgium and Luxembourg).,LUCAS

This is a high priority given its importance for consumers, public policy and private industry. Data collection programmes will need to adapt their scope if their information is to adequately address new information needs about high-level objectives. Assessment of sustainability at the farm level is hindered by the lack of data with which to derive appropriate, meaningful, and relevant indicators. This is particularly problematic for assessment of agricultural sustainability across the European Union (EU). Various databases exist at the EU scale regarding agricultural data sources and we identify one of these, the EU Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), as having considerable potential to assess farm-level sustainability at EU level. We critique several examples of published work that has attempted to assess agricultural sustainability using: FADN data alone; FADN data in combination with data from supplementary surveys, and; FADN data in combination with data from other EU databases. We conclude that the FADN would need to broaden its scope of data collection if it is to address the new information needs of policy, and we discuss the challenges in expanding FADN with a view towards wider farm-level assessment of sustainability.

In this context, the European Union considers agriculture a key sector of the economy, recognizing, however, the related environmental implications. The aim of this paper is to examine the agricultural efficiency of EU countries, through a bootstrap-Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach, an effective nonparametric method for evaluating the relative efficiency of the decision-making units. European datasets, suitable for policies and focused on the integration between agricultural productivity and ecosystem services (ESs) conservation, have been used to support planners and managers. Data related to five inputs (labor, land, capital, fertilizers, and irrigation area) and to one output connected to the economic value of agricultural production were collected from 1993 to 2013. The results show that the majority of EU countries have been experiencing increasing or decreasing returns to scale, highlighting their potential to increase their production efficiency by modifying their input use. Both for the output-oriented approach and the input-oriented approach, the majority of EU countries could better rationalize their input use obtaining more outputs and achieving production efficiency. DEA, a non-parametric methodology has been applied, using the concept of a reference group of efficient decision-making units that produce a similar output (peer group). Input-oriented and output-oriented DEA results and comparison indicate that most of the oldest EU countries have a more efficient and optimized crop production process in terms of resource savings and output maximization. This is probably due to the application of the Common Agricultural Policy. Therefore, in policy planning but also in management decisions, attention should always be paid not only to the maximization of agricultural production, but also to the environmental resource overexploitation. In this sense, best agricultural practices could represent a model to follow because they can maintain ESs without depressing production by using practices like conservation tillage, crop diversification, legume intensification and biological control perform giving the same results as intensive, high-input systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper explicitly states using European datasets to analyze agricultural efficiency across EU countries, meeting all inclusion criteria and violating no exclusion criteria.",

On the spatial scale typically used in terrestrial ecosystem models (0.5 or 1°) changes in LUC over time periods of a few years or more can include bidirectional changes on the sub-grid level, such as the parallel expansion and abandonment of agricultural land (e.g. in shifting cultivation) or cropland-grassland conversion (and vice versa). These complex changes between classes within a grid cell have often been neglected in previous studies, and only net changes of land between natural vegetation cover, cropland and pastures accounted for, mainly because of a lack of reliable high-resolution historical information on gross land transitions, in combination with technical limitations within the models themselves. In the present study we applied a state-of-The-Art dynamic global vegetation model with a detailed representation of croplands and carbon-nitrogen dynamics to quantify the uncertainty in terrestrial ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes arising from the choice between net and gross representations of LUC. We used three frequently applied global, one recent global and one recent European LUC datasets, two of which resolve gross land transitions, either in Europe or in certain tropical regions. When considering only net changes, land-use-Transition uncertainties (expressed as 1 standard deviation around decadal means of four models) in global carbon emissions from LUC (ELUC) are ±0.19, ±0.66 and ±0.47gCa1 in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, respectively, or between 14 and 39% LUC. Carbon stocks at the end of the 20th century vary by ±11 PgC for vegetation and ±37PgC for soil C due to the choice of LUC reconstruction, i.e. around 3% of the respective C pools. Accounting for sub-grid (gross) land conversions significantly increased the effect of LUC on global and European carbon stocks and fluxes, most noticeably enhancing global cumulative ELUC by 33PgC(1750-2014) and entailing a significant reduction in carbon stored in vegetation, although the effect on soil C stocks was limited. Simulations demonstrated that assessments of historical carbon stocks and fluxes are highly uncertain due to the choice of LUC reconstruction and that the consideration of different contrasting LUC reconstructions is needed to account for this uncertainty. The analysis of gross, in addition to net, land-use changes showed that the full complexity of gross land-use changes is required in order to accurately predict the magnitude of LUC change emissions. This introduces technical challenges to process-based models and relies on extensive information regarding historical land-use transitions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The paper uses multiple global datasets in addition to a European one, violating the 'exclusively European coverage' criterion.",

At first, BSA-AuNCs were prepared using a photo stable fluorescent substrate. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI) to produce thiocholine (TCh), and the sulfhydryl groups (SH-) on TCh form Au-S bonds with BSA-AuNCs; thus, the fluorescence of BSAAuNCs weakens. On the other hand, OPs can inhibit the activity of AChE, thus preventing the generation of TCh, and the fluorescence recovery of BSA-AuNCs occurs.

The identification of NO<inf>3</inf>− sources is critical to efficiently control or reverse NO<inf>3</inf>− contamination that affects many aquifers. In that respect, the use of stable isotope ratios 15N/14N and 18O/16O in NO<inf>3</inf>− (expressed as δ15N-NO<inf>3</inf>− and δ18O-NO<inf>3</inf>−, respectively) has long shown its value. However, limitations exist in complex environments where multiple nitrogen (N) sources coexist. This two-year study explores a method for improved NO<inf>3</inf>− source investigation in a shallow unconfined aquifer with mixed N inputs and a long established NO<inf>3</inf>− problem. In this tillage-dominated area of free-draining soil and subsoil, suspected NO<inf>3</inf>− sources were diffuse applications of artificial fertiliser and organic point sources (septic tanks and farmyards). Bearing in mind that artificial diffuse sources were ubiquitous, groundwater samples were first classified according to a combination of two indicators relevant of point source contamination: presence/absence of organic point sources (i.e. septic tank and/or farmyard) near sampling wells and exceedance/non-exceedance of a contamination threshold value for sodium (Na+) in groundwater. This classification identified three contamination groups: agricultural diffuse source but no point source (D+P−), agricultural diffuse and point source (D+P+) and agricultural diffuse but point source occurrence ambiguous (D+P±). Thereafter δ15N-NO<inf>3</inf>− and δ18O-NO<inf>3</inf>− data were superimposed on the classification. As δ15N-NO<inf>3</inf>− was plotted against δ18O-NO<inf>3</inf>−, comparisons were made between the different contamination groups. Overall, both δ variables were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.0001, r<inf>s</inf> = 0.599, slope of 0.5), which was indicative of denitrification. An inspection of the contamination groups revealed that denitrification did not occur in the absence of point source contamination (group D+P-). In fact, strong significant denitrification lines occurred only in the D+P+ and D+P± groups (p < 0.0001, r<inf>s</inf> > 0.6, 0.53 ≤ slope ≤ 0.76), i.e. where point source contamination was characterised or suspected. These lines originated from the 2–6‰ range for δ15N-NO<inf>3</inf>−, which suggests that i) NO<inf>3</inf>− contamination was dominated by an agricultural diffuse N source (most likely the large organic matter pool that has incorporated 15N-depleted nitrogen from artificial fertiliser in agricultural soils and whose nitrification is stimulated by ploughing and fertilisation) rather than point sources and ii) denitrification was possibly favoured by high dissolved organic content (DOC) from point sources. Combining contamination indicators and a large stable isotope dataset collected over a large study area could therefore improve our understanding of the NO<inf>3</inf>− contamination processes in groundwater for better land use management. We hypothesise that in future research, additional contamination indicators (e.g. pharmaceutical molecules) could also be combined to disentangle NO<inf>3</inf>− contamination from animal and human wastes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,The study is a local case study and does not use or produce a dataset with European coverage.,

To this end, this paper performs a panel data analysis of productivity and environmental costs on a farm accounting database across European regions over the 1989–2009 period. The models proposed take (i) farm output per hectare as indicator of productivity, and (ii) expenditures on energy, pesticides and fertilisers per hectare as proxy indicators of environmental costs. Results provide empirical evidence that the regions under study have a negative trend of productivity and a positive trend of environmental costs over the time frame mentioned. These results correlate negatively with both, economic and environmental sustainability of farms.

Emissions from European agriculture have been reduced, albeit at the expense of crop yield and the risk of production displacement (the transfer of production, and associated emissions, to land outside of Europe). This article assesses the impact on GHG emissions of selected European Rural Development Program measures, representative of a diversity of management strategies implemented on cultivated land, within nine European Member States. Climatic zone and underlying spatial environmental variables were accounted for using a novel technique, “Regional Variation Categories,” developed with European-scale GIS data sets. Production displacement is assessed with two benchmarks: (1) compared with existing crop production and (2) relative to a “minimum requirement” land management scenario, where an emissions reduction of less than this does not constitute mitigation. Most measures reduce emissions relative to the baseline crop scenario; however, many do not reduce emissions beyond the “minimum requirement,” this being limited to measures such as catch crops and within-field grass areas to prevent soil erosion.

As this activity is recognized in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), reporting on LULUC is an integral part of annual GHG inventories required from Annex I countries under the convention. In order to improve LULUC reporting, countries are shifting from national statistical data to high resolution spatial datasets. One such dataset is the Land-Parcel Information System (LPIS), an administrative spatial database developed to assist farmers and authorities assessing land eligibility for agricultural subsidies as part of the European Union's (EU) Common Agricultural Policy.Using the LPIS of the Republic of Ireland as a case study, we demonstrated significant differences in cropland/grassland reporting between an inter-annual based reporting schema and a land-use history approach. Twelve years of national LPIS data were analyzed to explore the dynamics between croplands and non-croplands. Major underlying cropland dynamics were identified with large areas changing between croplands and non-croplands even though annual total cropland areas were relatively stable over this period. Furthermore, we showed that in the 12 year study period, 69.8. ±. 10.7% of the area leaving cropland each year returned to cropland within the following five years. Following the EU Common Agricultural Policy definition, these areas count as temporary grassland, which according to IPCC reporting guidelines should be reported as cropland. In an example utilizing three different LULUC reporting methodologies (total area based, land-parcel based, and land-use history based) to assess changes in cropland and grassland areas for the 2008-2012 GHG commitment period, not including land-use history led to an underestimation of cropland by 45.7% as well as an associated error in land-use change assessment.

Dairy cows used 29%, other cattle 34%, pigs 17%, chicken 9%, sheep and goats 8%, and other animal categories 3% of the total feed use. Grass and annual forages were mainly used by dairy cows (30 and 49%, respectively) and other cattle (55 and 44%); pigs used most of the feed cereals (53%); protein-rich feed (e.g., soybean meal) were mostly used by pigs (34%) and chicken (24%). Differences between countries in feed use were large, mainly related to variations in national feed supply and animal productivity.

Ecological infrastructure is the nature-based equivalent of built or hard infrastructure, and is as important for providing services and underpinning socio-economic development. Hence, ecological infrastructure is expected to contribute to functioning as ecological disaster reduction, which is termed Ecosystem-based Solutions for Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR). Although ecological infrastructure already exists in the landscape, it might be degraded, needs to be maintained and managed, and in some cases restored. Maintenance and restoration of ecological infrastructure is important for security of human lives. Therefore, analytical tool and effective visualization tool in spatially explicit way for the past natural disaster and future prediction of natural disaster in relation to ecological infrastructure is considered helpful. Hence, Web-GIS based Ecological Infrastructure Environmental Information System (EI-EIS) has been developed. This paper aims to describe the procedure of development and future application of EI-EIS. The purpose of the EI-EIS is to evaluate functions of Eco-DRR. In order to analyse disaster data, collection of past disaster information, and disaster-prone area is effective. First, a number of digital maps and analogue maps in Japan and Europe were collected. In total, 18,572 maps over 100 years were collected. The Japanese data includes Future-Pop Data Series (1,736 maps), JMC dataset 50m grid (elevation) (13,071 maps), Old Edition Maps: Topographic Map (325 maps), Digital Base Map at a scale of 2500 for reconstruction planning (808 maps), Detailed Digital Land Use Information for Metropolitan Area (10 m land use) (2,436 maps), and Digital Information by GSI (national large scale map) (71 maps). Old Edition Maps: Topographic Map were analogue maps, and were scanned and georeferenced. These geographical area covered 1) Tohoku area, 2) Five Lakes of Mikata area (Fukui), 3) Ooshima Island (Tokyo), 4) Hiroshima area (Hiroshima), 5) Okushiri Island (Hokkaido), and 6) Toyooka City area (Hyogo). The European data includes topographic map in Germany (8 maps), old topographic map in Germany (31 maps), ancient map in Germany (23 maps), topographic map in Austria (9 maps), old topographic map in Austria (17 maps), and ancient map in Austria (37 maps). Second, focusing on Five Lakes of Mikata area as an example, these maps were integrated into the ArcGIS Online®(ESRI).

Rainfall erosivity is crucial to be considered at a monthly resolution, for the optimization of land management (seasonal variation of vegetation cover and agricultural support practices) as well as natural hazard protection (landslides and flood prediction). We expanded REDES by 140 rainfall stations, thus covering areas where monthly R-factor values were missing (Slovakia, Poland) or former data density was not satisfactory (Austria, France, and Spain). The different time resolutions (from 5 to 60 min) of high temporal data require a conversion of monthly R-factor based on a pool of stations with available data at all time resolutions. Because the conversion factors show smaller monthly variability in winter (January: 1.54) than in summer (August: 2.13), applying conversion factors on a monthly basis is suggested. The estimated monthly conversion factors allow transferring the R-factor to the desired time resolution at a European scale. The June to September period contributes to 53% of the annual rainfall erosivity in Europe, with different spatial and temporal patterns depending on the region. The study also investigated the heterogeneous seasonal patterns in different regions of Europe: on average, the Northern and Central European countries exhibit the largest R-factor values in summer, while the Southern European countries do so from October to January. In almost all countries (excluding Ireland, United Kingdom and North France), the seasonal variability of rainfall erosivity is high. Very few areas (mainly located in Spain and France) show the largest from February to April. The average monthly erosivity density is very large in August (1.67) and July (1.63), while very small in January and February (0.37).

In Italy, agritourism is considered an agricultural activity and can only be performed by a farmer. Moreover, Italian national legislation forces the farmer to dedicate himself mainly to traditional farming, rather than to tourism activities. For this reason, environmental performances have been highlighted by analyzing only features and production systems of the farms. By utilizing the most frequent indicators used in studies regarding sustainability, the authors show how Italian agritourisms tend to develop more environmentally friendly agricultural methods, which have a positive impact on biodiversity, landscape and natural resources. The empirical analysis is based on the Italian FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) dataset. The European FADN was created to represent farms’ technical and economic operation in the European Union and on which it drafts the agricultural and rural policies.

The European Commission's Soil Thematic Strategy has identified soil erosion as a relevant issue for the European Union, and has proposed an approach to monitor soil erosion. This paper presents the application of a modified version of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model (RUSLE2015) to estimate soil loss in Europe for the reference year 2010, within which the input factors (Rainfall erosivity, Soil erodibility, Cover-Management, Topography, Support practices) are modelled with the most recently available pan-European datasets. While RUSLE has been used before in Europe, RUSLE2015 improves the quality of estimation by introducing updated (2010), high-resolution (100m), peer-reviewed input layers. The mean soil loss rate in the European Union's erosion-prone lands (agricultural, forests and semi-natural areas) was found to be 2.46 t ha-1 yr-1, resulting in a total soil loss of 970 Mt annually. A major benefit of RUSLE2015 is that it can incorporate the effects of policy scenarios based on land-use changes and support practices. The impact of the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) requirements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the EU's guidelines for soil protection can be grouped under land management (reduced/no till, plant residues, cover crops) and support practices (contour farming, maintenance of stone walls and grass margins). The policy interventions (GAEC, Soil Thematic Strategy) over the past decade have reduced the soil loss rate by 9.5% on average in Europe, and by 20% for arable lands. Special attention is given to the 4 million ha of croplands which currently have unsustainable soil loss rates of more than 5 t ha-1 yr-1, and to which policy measures should be targeted. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract states the use of multiple recent pan-European datasets to estimate soil loss in Europe.

Moreover, it is estimated that 50% of all plant and animal species (including some of that are listed in the EU Habitat Directive) depend on agricultural practices. The continuation of appropriate agricultural land management is essential to ensure these primary functions. Avoidance of farmland abandonment is therefore an important rationale for the EU's Common Agricultural Policy which requires improved knowledge of this phenomenon at the European level. This study assesses the risk of farmland abandonment in the 27 EU Member States. It summarizes the work performed by an expert panel of European scientists and national representatives which aimed to identify the main drivers of farmland abandonment in Europe, to define indicators for assessing its risk of occurrence and to test the value of European-wide data sources to achieve these aims. Drivers were identified under two rationales: low farm stability and viability, and negative regional context. Indicators were defined using recent socio-economic farm data and geospatial datasets. Some indicators were then combined to make a composite risk indicator. Regions with higher risk of farmland abandonment are located in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Ireland. This paper demonstrates the challenges of performing a European-wide assessment of a phenomenon influenced by drivers whose effects vary at local levels. Other problems encountered are data heterogeneity in terms of spatial resolution and quality, as well as access to micro-data (local level data). High spatial resolution European datasets measuring farmland abandonment are needed to validate the defined indicators as well as to benchmark the methodology. Furthermore, such data could be used to establish a weighting system for the drivers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract clearly states the use of 'European-wide data sources', including socio-economic farm data and geospatial datasets, to assess the risk of farmland abandonment in the EU.",

Among the different soil erosion risk factors, the cover-management factor (C-factor) is the one that policy makers and farmers can most readily influence in order to help reduce soil loss rates. The present study proposes a methodology for estimating the C-factor in the European Union (EU), using pan-European datasets (such as CORINE Land Cover), biophysical attributes derived from remote sensing, and statistical data on agricultural crops and practices. In arable lands, the C-factor was estimated using crop statistics (% of land per crop) and data on management practices such as conservation tillage, plant residues and winter crop cover. The C-factor in non-arable lands was estimated by weighting the range of literature values found according to fractional vegetation cover, which was estimated based on the remote sensing dataset F<inf>cover</inf>. The mean C-factor in the EU is estimated to be 0.1043, with an extremely high variability; forests have the lowest mean C-factor (0.00116), and arable lands and sparsely vegetated areas the highest (0.233 and 0.2651, respectively). Conservation management practices (reduced/no tillage, use of cover crops and plant residues) reduce the C-factor by on average 19.1% in arable lands.The methodology is designed to be a tool for policy makers to assess the effect of future land use and crop rotation scenarios on soil erosion by water. The impact of land use changes (deforestation, arable land expansion) and the effect of policies (such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the push to grow more renewable energy crops) can potentially be quantified with the proposed model.

This paper reviews the history of land conversion in the Cerrado and the development of soil properties and water resources under past and ongoing land use. We compared soil and water quality parameters from different land uses considering 80 soil and 18 water studies conducted in different regions across the Cerrado to provide quantitative evidence of soil and water alterations from land use change. Following the conversion of native Cerrado, significant effects on soil pH, bulk density and available P and K for croplands and less-pronounced effects on pastures were evident. Soil total N did not differ between land uses because most of the sites classified as croplands were nitrogen-fixing soybeans, which are not artificially fertilized with N. In contrast, water quality studies showed nitrogen enrichment in agricultural catchments, indicating fertilizer impacts and potential susceptibility to eutrophication. Regardless of the land use, P is widely absent because of the high-fixing capacities of deeply weathered soils and the filtering capacity of riparian vegetation. Pesticides, however, were consistently detected throughout the entire aquatic system. In several case studies, extremely high-peak concentrations exceeded Brazilian and European Union (EU) water quality limits, which were potentially accompanied by serious health implications. Land use intensification is likely to continue, particularly in regions where less annual rainfall and severe droughts are projected in the northeastern and western Cerrado. Thus, the leaching risk and displacement of agrochemicals are expected to increase, particularly because the current legislation has caused a reduction in riparian vegetation. We conclude that land use intensification is likely to seriously limit the Cerrado's future regarding both agricultural productivity and ecosystem stability. Because only limited data are available, we recommend further field studies to understand the interaction between terrestrial and aquatic systems. This study may serve as a valuable database for integrated modelling to investigate the impact of land use and climate change on soil and water resources and to test and develop mitigation measures for the Cerrado.

Many species and ecosystems of conservation concern in Europe depend on agricultural management and are showing ongoing declines. Agri-environment schemes (AES) are designed partly to address this. They are a major source of nature conservation funding within the European Union (EU) and the highest conservation expenditure in Europe. We reviewed the structure of current AES across Europe. Since a 2003 review questioned the overall effectiveness of AES for biodiversity, there has been a plethora of case studies and meta-analyses examining their effectiveness. Most syntheses demonstrate general increases in farmland biodiversity in response to AES, with the size of the effect depending on the structure and management of the surrounding landscape. This is important in the light of successive EU enlargement and ongoing reforms of AES. We examined the change in effect size over time by merging the data sets of 3 recent meta-analyses and found that schemes implemented after revision of the EU's agri-environmental programs in 2007 were not more effective than schemes implemented before revision. Furthermore, schemes aimed at areas out of production (such as field margins and hedgerows) are more effective at enhancing species richness than those aimed at productive areas (such as arable crops or grasslands). Outstanding research questions include whether AES enhance ecosystem services, whether they are more effective in agriculturally marginal areas than in intensively farmed areas, whether they are more or less cost-effective for farmland biodiversity than protected areas, and how much their effectiveness is influenced by farmer training and advice?

The ethnoveterinary pharmacopoeia is often composed of ingredients available in the local environment, and may include plants, animals and minerals, or combinations thereof, for use in treating various ailments in reared animals. The aim of this study was to survey the current day ethnoveterinary practices of ethnic Hungarian (Székely) settlements situated in the Erdővidék commune (Covasna County, Transylvania, Romania) and to compare them with earlier works on this topic in Romania and other European countries. Methods: Data concerning ethnoveterinary practices were collected through semi-structured interviews and direct observation in 12 villages from 2010 to 2014. The cited plant species were collected, identified, dried and deposited in a herbarium. The use of other materials (e.g. animals, minerals and other substances) were also documented. Data were compared to earlier reports of ethnoveterinary knowledge in Transylvania and other European countries using various databases. Results: In total, 26 wild and cultivated plants, 2 animals, and 17 other substances were documented to treat 11 ailments of cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep. The majority of applications were for the treatment of mastitis and skin ailments, while only a few data were reported for the treatment of cataracts, post-partum ailments and parasites. The traditional uses of Armoracia rusticana, Rumex spp., powdered sugar and glass were reported in each village. The use of some plant taxa, such as Allium sativum, Aristolochia clematitis, and Euphorbia amygdaloides was similar to earlier reports from other Transylvanian regions. Conclusions: Although permanent veterinary and medical services are available in some of the villages, elderly people preferred the use of wild and cultivated plants, animals and other materials in ethnoveterinary medicine. Some traditional ethnoveterinary practices are no longer in use, but rather persist only in the memories of the eldest subset of the population. A decline in the vertical transmission of ethnoveterinary knowledge was evident and loss of practice is likely compounded by market availability of ready-made pharmaceuticals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study is based on data collected in Covasna County, Romania, which is local/national coverage, not exclusively European.",

From a meteorological point of view, drought can be induced and/or reinforced by lack of precipitation, hot temperatures and enhanced evapotranspiration. Starting from a multi-indicator approach, we present European-wide meteorological drought climatologies and trends for the period 1950-2012. As input data, we used precipitation and temperature data from the E-OBS (spatial resolution: 0.25°. ×. 0.25°) gridded dataset of the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D). Precipitation, temperature, and the derived potential evapotranspiration (PET) have been used to compute three drought indicators: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI). SPI, SPEI, and RDI, calculated for 12-month accumulation period, have been rationally merged into a combined indicator and this quantity has been used to obtain drought frequency, duration, and severity for the entire Europe. We identified the following drought hotspots: Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and Russia in 1951-1970, no particular hotspot in 1971-1990, the Mediterranean region and the Baltic Republics in 1991-2010. A linear trend analysis shows that drought variables increased in the period 1950-2012 in South-Western Europe, in particular in the Mediterranean and Carpathian regions, with precipitation decrease and PET increase as drivers. Drought variables show a decrease in Scandinavia, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia: precipitation increase is the main driver. In Central Europe and the Balkans, drought variables show a moderate increase, for the significant PET increase outbalances a not significant precipitation increase. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The abstract explicitly states the use of the E-OBS dataset from the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D) for a European-wide drought analysis.,E-OBS; European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D)

A weed traits database (WTDB) was designed, populated and analysed, initially using data for 19 common European weeds, to begin to consolidate trait data in a single repository. The initial choice of traits was driven by the requirements of empirical models of weed population dynamics to identify correlations between traits and model parameters. These relationships were used to build a generic model, operating at the level of functional traits, to simulate the impact of increasing herbicide and fertiliser use on virtual weeds along gradients of seed weight and maximum height. The model generated 'fitness contours' (defined as population growth rates) within this trait space in different scenarios, onto which two sets of weed species, defined as common or declining in the UK, were mapped. The effect of increasing inputs on the weed flora was successfully simulated; 77% of common species were predicted to have stable or increasing populations under high fertiliser and herbicide use, in contrast with only 29% of the species that have declined. Future development of the WTDB will aim to increase the number of species covered, incorporate a wider range of traits and analyse intraspecific variability under contrasting management and environments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"Although the paper develops a weed traits database for European weeds, the specific application described is to predict shifts in weed communities in the UK, making the data used in the analysis national, which is an exclusion criterion.",

User groups with an interest in past land cover include the climate modelling community, socio-ecological historians and earth system scientists. Europe is one of the continents with the longest histories of land conversion from forest to farmland, thus understanding land cover change in this area is globally significant. This study applies the pseudobiomization method (PBM) to 982 pollen records from across Europe, taken from the European Pollen Database (EPD) to produce a first synthesis of pan-European land cover change for the period 9000 bp to present, in contiguous 200 year time intervals. The PBM transforms pollen proportions from each site to one of eight land cover classes (LCCs) that are directly comparable to the CORINE land cover classification. The proportion of LCCs represented in each time window provides a spatially aggregated record of land cover change for temperate and northern Europe, and for a series of case study regions (western France, the western Alps, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia). At the European scale, the impact of Neolithic food producing economies appear to be detectable from 6000 bp through reduction in broad-leaf forests resulting from human land use activities such as forest clearance. Total forest cover at a pan-European scale moved outside the range of previous background variability from 4000 bp onwards. From 2200 bp land cover change intensified, and the broad pattern of land cover for preindustrial Europe was established by 1000 bp.

Until recently, the application of this model has not been very widespread. Hence, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the CROPGRO cabbage model for white cabbage (Brassica oleracea convar. capitata var. alba L.) production under temperate European climate conditions. Data sets of field experiments from southwest Germany were used for model calibration including observed data of number of leaves, leaf area index, specific leaf area, leaf and stem weight, head weight and total aboveground biomass. For model evaluation, cabbage data sets over three years from southeast and over two years from east Germany were used. The genotype files (cultivar and ecotype), which include the main parameters of crop phenology and plant growth, were adapted to the standard European cabbage cultivar 'Kalorama'. Observed dry matter cabbage head yields over different years and different locations ranged between 6574kgha-1 and 11926kgha-1; head yields over all datasets were predicted by the model with an accuracy of R2=0.98. Sensitivity analysis conducted under different nitrogen fertilizer amounts (-50% N to +50% N) and two fertilizer application strategies (basal and split) generated logical, useful results from an agronomic point of view. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the efficiency of nitrogen fertilization highly depends on the genetically determined potential yield of a specific cabbage cultivar under given environmental conditions.

Biomass products, such as food, fiber, or bioenergy, are increasingly traded globally, thereby leading to telecouplings between distant, seemingly unrelated regions. For example, restrictions for agricultural production or changes in bioenergy demand in Europe or the United States might contribute to deforestation in Latin America or Sub-Saharan Africa. One approach to analyze trade-related land-use effects of the global socioeconomic biomass metabolism is the ""embodied human appropriation of net primary production"" or eHANPP. eHANPP accounts allocate to any product the entire amount of the human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) that emerges throughout its supply chain. This allows consumption-based accounts to move beyond simple area-demand approaches by taking differences in natural productivity as well as in land-use intensity into account, both across land-use types as well as across world regions. In this article, we discuss the eHANPP related to the European Union's (EU) consumption of biomass products in the period 1986-2007, based on a consistent global trade data set derived from bilateral data. We find a considerable dependency of the EU on the appropriation of biological productivity outside its own boundaries, with increasing reliance on Latin America as a main supplier. By using the EU as an illustrative example, we demonstrate the usefulness of eHANPP for assessing land-use impacts caused by nations' socioeconomic activities and conclude that the eHANPP approach can provide useful information to better manage ecosystems globally in the face of an increasingly interconnected world. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study is based on a 'global trade data set', which violates the inclusion criterion requiring exclusively European data sources.",

By applying a qualitative content analysis, this paper analyses how food manufacturers and retailers (referred to as gatekeepers in the food industry) explain and defend the exclusion of GM-labelled food products on the EU market. The study design places emphasis on the role of perceptions in the strategic behaviour of gatekeepers and on the role of interaction in this regard, as we assume that the way in which gatekeepers perceive the 'rules of the game' for commercialising GM crop applications on the EU food market will be influenced by their interaction with other agribusiness actors.In a first stage, the analysis determines thematic congruence in the (types of) perceptions that explain an agribusiness actor's overall interpretation of the EU business environment for GM crop applications. This perceived 'structuring arena' (SA) for GM crop applications - as conceptualised within our framework - contains areas of either internal and external tensions, that have a compelling or non-committal influence on the agribusiness actor's interpretation. In a second stage, the analysis particularly defines how gatekeepers in the food industry perceive and experience the SA for GM crop applications on the EU market, and how these perceptual tensions subsequently influence their strategic behaviour for GM-labelled products on the EU market.

Recent scientific progress in deep learning methods has highlighted the capacity to extract field boundaries from satellite and aerial images with a clear improvement from object-based image analysis (e.g. multiresolution segmentation) or conventional filters (e.g. Sobel filters). However, these methods need labels to be trained on. So far, no standard data set exists to easily and robustly benchmark models and progress the state of the art. The absence of such benchmark data further impedes proper comparison against existing methods. Besides, there is no consensus on which evaluation metrics should be reported (both at the pixel and field levels). As a result, it is currently impossible to compare and benchmark new and existing methods. To fill these gaps, we introduce AI4Boundaries, a data set of images and labels readily usable to train and compare models on field boundary detection. AI4Boundaries includes two specific data sets: (i) a 10 m Sentinel-2 monthly composites for large-scale analyses in retrospect and (ii) a 1 m orthophoto data set for regional-scale analyses, such as the automatic extraction of Geospatial Aid Application (GSAA). All labels have been sourced from GSAA data that have been made openly available (Austria, Catalonia, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Sweden) for 2019, representing 14.8 M parcels covering 376 K km2.

The overall statistical model consists of two submodels namely donor and donee modules. The donor module uses statistics to quantify the relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC) and environmental covariates. The covariates were selected based on their availability at global scale and their roles as major drivers that affect the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. Multiple linear regression was used in the donor module with the selected covariates and dense SOC measurements coming from LUCAS soil database (Toth et al., 2013a). The LUCAS soil database has more than 22,000 SOC measurements from European countries and a standardized sampling procedure was used routinely to collect samples of around 0.5 kg of topsoil (0-20 cm) each. The donor module reveals and quantifies the relationships between SOC mass concentration in soil and the predictors to be used in the donee model to extend the prediction at global scale using the same set of predictors. We used the WorldClim dataset (Hijmans et al., 2005), which is comprised of global climate data layers representing long-term conditions for the years from 1950 to 2000.

E.",2018,"Sufficient and accurate hydro-meteorological data are essential to manage water resources. Recently developed global reanalysis datasets have significant potential in providing these data, especially in regions such as Southern Africa that are both vulnerable and data poor. These global reanalysis datasets have, however, not yet been exhaustively validated and it is thus unclear to what extent these are able to adequately capture the climatic variability of water resources, in particular for extreme events such as floods. This article critically assesses the potential of a recently developed global Water Resources Reanalysis (WRR) dataset developed in the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7) eartH2Observe (E2O) project for identifying floods, focussing on the occurrence of floods in the Limpopo River basin in Southern Africa. The discharge outputs of seven global models and ensemble mean of those models as available in the WRR dataset are analysed and compared against two benchmarks of flood events in the Limpopo River basin. The first benchmark is based on observations from the available stations, while the second is developed based on flood events that have led to damages as reported in global databases of damaging flood events. Results show that, while the WRR dataset provides useful data for detecting the occurrence of flood events in the Limpopo River basin, variation exists amongst the global models regarding their capability to identify the magnitude of those events. The study also reveals that the models are better able to capture flood events at stations with a large upstream catchment area. Improved performance for most models is found for the 0.25 degrees resolution global model, when compared to the lower-resolution 0.5 degrees models, thus underlining the added value of increased-resolution global models. The skill of the global hydrological models (GHMs) in identifying the severity of flood events in poorly gauged basins such as the Limpopo can be used to estimate the impacts of those events using the benchmark of reported damaging flood events developed at the basin level, though this could be improved if further details on location and impacts are included in disaster databases. Large-scale models such as those included in the WRR dataset are used by both global and continental forecasting systems, and this study sheds light on the potential these have in providing information useful for local-scale flood risk management. In conclusion, this study offers valuable insights in the applicability of global reanalysis data for identifying impacting flood events in data-sparse regions.",no,"The abstract discusses a global dataset (Water Resources Reanalysis) and applies it to a case study in Southern Africa, failing the exclusively European coverage criterion.",

This study presents the INFOSOLO legacy database as the first effort to develop a soil information system in Portugal, suitable to compile soil data produced in the country, and to support stakeholders and land managers in decision-making. The database currently includes soil data from a set of 9934 horizons/layers studied in 3461 soil profiles across the country between 1966 and 2014. Data was extracted from scattered soil surveys, research projects, and academic studies carried out by public Portuguese and other European institutions, with a series of validation tests and harmonization procedures being implemented in order to access and improve the quality of the data. The importance of the INFOSOLO legacy dataset was discussed and exemplified with the analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution of selected soil properties, namely the organic carbon content, pH, and cation exchange capacity. For these properties, 1 km grid maps were also developed for the topsoil horizons/layers in Portugal using different spatial modelling approaches. To highlight the importance of using INFOSOLO for soil characterization, the EU-wide soil database LUCAS was used to compare both datasets in terms of data distributions, spatial continuity and accuracy of modelling outputs. The comparison also included the digital soil maps provided by the SoilGrids product for Portugal. The comparison results highlighted specific areas in the country for which INFOSOLO is capable to deliver accurate but also more reliable predictions when compared with the LUCAS and SoilGrids results.

Large spectral libraries could be exploited to decrease the effort of soil variable estimation and obtain more widely applicable models. We investigated the feasibility of a new approach, referred to as bottom-up, to provide soil organic carbon (SOC) maps of bare cropland fields over a large area without recourse to chemical analyses, employing both the pan-European topsoil database from the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) and Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) hyperspectral airborne data. This approach was tested in two areas having different soil characteristics: the loam belt in Belgium, and the Gutland-Oesling region in Luxembourg. Partial least square regression (PLSR) models were used in each study area to estimate SOC content, using both bottom-up and traditional approaches. The PLSR model's accuracy was tested on an independent validation dataset. Both approaches provide SOC maps having a satisfactory level of accuracy (RMSE = 1.5-4.9 gkg(-1); ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) = 1.4-1.7) and the inter-comparison did not show differences in terms of RMSE and RPD either in the loam belt or in Luxembourg.

This study compares four different soil moisture products with the flux tower site observation at 18 cropland sites across the world where either of maize, soybean, rice and wheat is grown. These products include the first and second versions of Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture (CCISM-1 and CCISM-2) datasets distributed by the European Space Agency and two different AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System)-derived soil moisture datasets, separately provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (AMSRE-J) and U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (AMSRE-N). The comparison demonstrates varying reliability of these products in representing major characteristics of temporal pattern of cropland soil moisture by product and crop. Possible reasons for the varying reliability include the differences in sensors, algorithms, bands and criteria used when estimating soil moisture. Both the CCISM-1 and CCISM-2 products appear the most reliable for soybean- and wheat-growing area. However, the percentage of valid data of these products is always lower than other products due to relatively strict criteria when merging data derived from multiple sources, although the CCISM-2 product has much more data with valid retrievals than the CCISM-1 product. The reliability of the AMSRE-J product is the highest for maize- and rice-growing areas and comparable to or slightly lower than the CCISM products for soybean and wheat-growing areas. The AMSRE-N is the least reliable in most location-crop combinations. The reliability of the products for rice-growing area is far lower than that of other upland crops likely due to the extensive use of irrigation and patch distribution of rice paddy in the area examined here. We conclude that the CCISM-1, CCISM-2 and AMSRE-J products are applicable to GGCM evaluation, while the AMSRE-N product is not. However, we encourage users to integrate these products with in situ soil moisture data especially when GGCMs simulations for rice are evaluated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

There is thus an urgent and crucial need to combine these data at the European scale. In the frame of a large European Joint Programme on agricultural soils launched by the European Commission, a survey was conducted in the spring of 2020, in the 24 European participating countries to assess the existing soil data sources, focusing on agricultural soils. The survey will become a contribution to the European Soil Observatory, launched in December 2020, which aims to collect metadata of soil databases related to all kind of land uses, including forest and urban soils. Based upon a comprehensive questionnaire, 170 soil databases were identified at local, regional and national scales. Soil parameters were divided into five groups: (1) main soil parameters according to the Global Soil Map specifications; (2) other soil chemical parameters; (3) other physical parameters; (4) other pedological parameters; and (5) soil biological features. A classification based on the environmental zones of Europe was used to distinguish the climatic zones. This survey shows that while most of the main pedological and chemical parameters are included in more than 70% of the country soil databases, water content, contamination with organic pollutants, and biological parameters are the least frequently reported parameters. Such differences will have consequences when developing an EU policy on soil health as proposed under the EU soil strategy for 2023 and using the data to derive soil health indicators. Many differences in the methods used in collecting, preparing, and analysing the soils were found, thus requiring harmonization procedures and more cooperation among countries and with the EU to use the data at the European scale. In addition, choosing harmonized and useful interpretation and threshold values for EU soil indicators may be challenging due to the different methods used and the wide variety of soil land-use and climate combinations influencing possible thresholds.

Some solutions require rapid data exchange for action or anomaly detection. However, the administration of this large amount of data, which in turn evolves over time, is highly complicated. Management systems add long-time delays to the spatio-temporal data injection and gathering. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal semantic data model for agriculture. To validate the model, data from real livestock and crop scenarios, retrieved from the AFarCloud smart farming platform, are modeled according to the proposal. Time-series Database (TSDB) engine InfluxDB is used to evaluate the model against data management. In addition, an architecture for the management of spatio-temporal semantic agricultural data in real-time is proposed. This architecture results in the DAM&DQ system responsible for data management as semantic middleware on the AFarCloud platform.

Modelling/mapping of these valuable and fragile areas is needed for improved ecosystem management, based on an accounting of changes and on monitoring of their functioning over time. In Europe, the main legislative driver behind this goal is the European Commission's Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, on the one hand aiming at halting biodiversity loss, on the other hand enhancing ecosystem services by 2020, and restoring them as far as is feasible. A model, based on Earth Observation data, including Digital Elevation Models, hydrological, soil, land cover/land use data, and vegetation indices is employed in a multi-modular and stratified approach, based on fuzzy logic and object based image analysis, to delineate potential, observed and actual riparian zones. The approach is designed in an open modular way, allowing future modifications and repeatability. The results represent a first step of a future monitoring and assessment campaign for European riparian zones and their implications on biodiversity and on ecosystem functions and services. Considering the complexity and the enormous extent of the area, covering 39 European countries, including Turkey, the level of detail is unprecedented. Depending on the accounting modus, 0.95%-1.19% of the study area can be attributed as actual riparian area (considering Strahler's stream orders 3-8, based on the Copernicus EU-Hydro dataset), corresponding to 55,558-69,128 km(2).

To effectively do so, quantified overviews of pollutant emissions at national levels and with some granularity in their sources, are required. However, current monitoring efforts are often scattered and a quantitative and comprehensive inventory of toxic emissions in Europe is lacking. Toxic pollutants stem from a large variety of emission sources from industry, agriculture, households, etc. and the difficulty to cover all of them is manifest in public databases and official reports, where data gaps across countries and years exist for several substances. Here, we propose a methodology to tackle this problem and build comprehensive and harmonized national inventories of toxic pollutants. Using public databases, official reports, scientific literature and developing extrapolation techniques specific to each emission source, we derived harmonized annual inventories of toxic pollutants in all EU Member States over the years 2000-2014. They present an unprecedented coverage of 805, 572, and 468 substances emitted to air, water and soil, respectively. Although the resulting dataset shows a relatively good agreement with previous inventories of narrower scopes, uncertainties can be identified for specific emission sources and in the development of extrapolation techniques, thus calling for further research in these areas. Such efforts should also explore adaptation of the methodology to derive comprehensive inventories for countries outside EU, where data is scarcer. Nonetheless, the developed national inventories can provide a starting point for territorial chemical footprints of toxic pollutants and could be coupled with environmental impact assessment for gauging the damages to ecosystems and human health from toxic pollutants emitted in Europe. This can ultimately support policy-makers in their pollutants prioritisation and benchmarking across substances and countries towards improved toxic emission reduction policies.",yes,The paper describes the creation of harmonized inventories of toxic pollutants from sources including agriculture for all EU Member States.,

BD data sampled at 0-10 and 10-20 cm were averaged to harmonize the BD with the mass fraction of coarse fragments measured in 2009, 2012 and 2015. Samples were from cropland, grassland and woodland soils, which accounted for 41%, 21% and 30%, respectively, of the total number of selected sites (n = 6059); 'bareland', and 'shrubland' accounted for 3% of the sites each, whereas 'artificial land' accounted for <1%. Only six samples were classified as 'wetland'. The dataset was produced assuming the mass density of the coarse fraction to be constant across all LUCAS soil samples. We also estimated the SOC stocks associated with LUCAS 2018 BD and SOC content measurements and showed that correcting the BD by the coarse mass fraction instead of the coarse volume fraction generates SOC stock underestimation. We found the highest deviations in woodlands and shrublands. We showed that, when SOC stock is computed with coarse mass fraction, the error compared with the computation by volume may vary depending on the SOC and coarse mass fraction. This may imply a SOC stock underestimation for European soils.

These data include annual geospatially referenced information on crops grown on all land used by farmers to claim CAP-related payments. This paper sets out to comprehensively collect and systematically review scientific literature that has used IACS land use data. It provides a reference for future users of the data and demonstrates their unique scientific potential. Following the methodology of a systematic mapping review, we identified 270 publications using IACS land use data from Austria, Czechia (formerly the Czech Republic), France, Germany, and Sweden. Most were from the disciplines of ecology, agronomy, and land use sciences with fewer from remote sensing, economics, hydrology, and medicine. Based on a subsample analysis, we demonstrate that IACS land use data are most commonly used to describe agricultural land use and related impacts on ecological and agronomic outcomes, and to calibrate various types of models to observed land use. However, it appears that research groups using the data are not well connected, common terminology is lacking, and reproducibility suffers from missing details about data acquisition, pre-processing, and use.

These core values are reflected in the changing Common Agricultural Policy. This policy is one of the key drivers of agricultural practice across the EU, as it has become more oriented towards the concepts of sustainability in recent years. The EU operates a farm-level monitoring system, the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), which acts as a check to establish if such successful change is being achieved, currently the primary focus is on the economic dimension of sustainability. We argue that to complement existing monitoring tools, cost-effective measurement of indicators for other sustainability dimensions a the farm scale is required.This article explores to what extent EU agricultural beneficiaries data as collected under the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) can be a complementary source of information for this task. To this end, candidate indicators for the environmental dimension from available studies were reviewed and it was assessed whether the data requirements for the indicators could be ma through IACS data.The identified five environmental indicators were produced from an IACS data set from Germany.The indicator data was quantitatively analysed and compared with target values reported in the literature, and interpreted with regard to meaningfulness and possible improvements. Our results show that IACS data is indeed a potential source for farm level indicators for the environmental dimension, primarily with regard to landscape diversity (landscape features, parcel size) and the diversity of crop production. The spatial nature of IACS allows for a link to other environmental data and to agroecosystem models which may provide additional indicators, e.g. nutrient balances. However, important information on management of field operations and livestock herds is still insufficient in both FADN and IACS.",yes,"The paper discusses the use of EU-wide agricultural datasets (IACS, FADN) for monitoring, which meets all inclusion criteria.",Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS); Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN)

The main air pollutants are included: NOx, SO2, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), NH3, CO, PM10 and PM2.5, and also CH4. To stay as close as possible to the emissions as officially reported and used in policy assessment, the inventory uses the officially reported emission data by European countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive as the basis where possible. Where deemed necessary because of errors, incompleteness or inconsistencies, these are replaced with or complemented by other emission data, most notably the estimates included in the Greenhouse gas Air pollution Interaction and Synergies (GAINS) model. Emissions are collected at the high sectoral level, distinguishing around 250 different sector-fuel combinations, whereafter a consistent spatial distribution is applied for Europe. A specific proxy is selected for each of the sector-fuel combinations, pollutants and years. Point source emissions are largely based on reported facility-level emissions, complemented by other sources of point source data for power plants. For specific sources, the resulting emission data were replaced with other datasets. Emissions from shipping (both inland and at sea) are based on the results from a separate shipping emission model where emissions are based on actual ship movement data, and agricultural waste burning emissions are based on satellite observations. The resulting spatially distributed emissions are evaluated against earlier versions of the dataset as well as against alternative emission estimates, which reveals specific discrepancies in some cases. Along with the resulting annual emission maps, profiles for splitting particulate matter (PM) and NMVOCs into individual components are provided, as well as information on the height profile by sector and temporal disaggregation down to the hourly level to support modelling activities.

Measurement of enteric CH4 is complex, expensive, and impractical at large scales; therefore, models are commonly used to predict CH4 production. However, building robust prediction models requires extensive data from animals under different management systems worldwide. The objectives of this study were to (1) collate a global database of enteric CH4 production from individual lactating dairy cattle; (2) determine the availability of key variables for predicting enteric CH4 production (g/day per cow), yield [g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)], and intensity (g/kg energy corrected milk) and their respective relationships; (3) develop intercontinental and regional models and cross-validate their performance; and (4) assess the trade-off between availability of on-farm inputs and CH4 prediction accuracy. The intercontinental database covered Europe (EU), the United States (US), and Australia (AU). A sequential approach was taken by incrementally adding key variables to develop models with increasing complexity. Methane emissions were predicted by fitting linear mixed models. Within model categories, an intercontinental model with the most available independent variables performed best with root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) as a percentage of mean observed value of 16.6%, 14.7%, and 19.8% for intercontinental, EU, and United States regions, respectively. Less complex models requiring only DMI had predictive ability comparable to complex models. Enteric CH4 production, yield, and intensity prediction models developed on an intercontinental basis had similar performance across regions, however, intercepts and slopes were different with implications for prediction. Revised CH4 emission conversion factors for specific regions are required to improve CH4 production estimates in national inventories. In conclusion, information on DMI is required for good prediction, and other factors such as dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration, improve the prediction. For enteric CH4 yield and intensity prediction, information on milk yield and composition is required for better estimation.",no,"The dataset has intercontinental/global coverage, not exclusively European.",

Land use and land cover change have been well documented in the past 200 years across Europe 'where land cover grassland and cropland together make up 39%2. In recent years, the agricultural sector has been affected by abnormal weather events. Climate change will continue to change weather patterns, for some regions, this will have a positive impact. For other regions, it will be negative. Hail, heavy rainfall, floods, and droughts may lead to a reduction in agricultural land in some regions with an additional impact on biodiversity. For that reason, major climatic and hydrological variables such as temperature, precipitation, vegetation index, and soil moisture must be regularly monitored and the trends of their deviations from the normal must be observed. This research investigates the quantity of potato production in the future in two stages. In the first stage, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)3 models are used for yield and soil moisture forecasting. The models are trained on a dataset acquired in time series from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)4 satellite from 2010 to 2019 and are compared by statistics on potato production from EUROSTAT5 at the national scale. In the second stage, the approach uses Support Vector Machine (SVM)6 architecture of Sentinel 2 Vegetation Index satellite imagery together with weather and Sentinel 1 surface soil moisture information for the EU-28 member countries by season 2018 for single potato fields. Agricultural statistical data such as crop calendar, map, production area, yield, and acreage are collected from Eurostat while vector data collection from Land Use and Land Cover Survey (LUCAS) and Land Cover from national to small scale agriculture (CORINE)8. The ARIMA output performances measure Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). RMSE for soil moisture forecasting is 0.3792, 0.2816, 0.2679, 0.2110, and 0.1791 for East, West, South, North, and Centre EU respectively. MSE for potato yield forecasting is 0.0954, 0.081, 0.0589, 0.0447, and 0.0199 for North, Centre, East, South, and West EU respectively. The number of known crop field areas and the distance between them are different for each country and this alters the dimension of the classification input.

Peatland carbon accumulation is determined by the balance between plant production and peat decomposition. But both processes are expected to accelerate in northern peatlands due to warming, leading to uncertainty in future peatland carbon budgets.

In this paper, we attempted a new strategy of depicting leaf shapes by convolving the contour vector functions with Gaussian functions of different widths. The resulting Gaussian convolution vector (GCV) has the following traits that are desirable for shape characterization: (1) It provides an overall description to the shape in which both the curvature features and the proportional relationship of leaf contour are encoded. (2) It is intrinsically invariant to the group transformations including translation, scaling and rotation. (3) It depicts local shape geometry at multiple scales which enhance the discriminative power of the shape descriptors.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the current global land-cover (GLC) products and to understand the differences between these products so that they can be used effectively in different applications. In this study, three 30-m GLC products, namely GlobeLand30-2010, GLC_FCS30-2015, and FROM_GLC30-2015, were evaluated in terms of areal consistency and spatial consistency using the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) reference dataset over the European Union (EU). Given the limitations of the traditional confusion matrix used in accuracy assessment, we adjusted the confusion matrices from sample counts by accounting for the class proportions of the map and reported the standard errors of the descriptive accuracy measures in the accuracy assessment. The results revealed the following. (1) The overall accuracy of the GlobeLand30-2010 product was the highest at 88.90 +/- 0.68%; this was followed by GLC_FCS30-2015 (84.33 +/- 0.80%) and FROM_GLC2015 (65.31 +/- 1.0%). (2) The consistency between the GLC_FCS30-2015 and GlobeLand30-2010 is higher than the consistency between other products, with an area correlation coefficient of 0.930 and a proportion of consistent pixels of 52.41%, respectively. (3) Across the area of the EU, the dominant land-cover types such as forest and cropland are the most consistent across the three products, whereas the spatial consistency for bare land, grassland, shrubland, and wetland is relatively low. (4) The proportion of pixels for which the consistency is low accounts for less than 16.17% of pixels, whereas the proportion of pixels for which the consistency is high accounts for about 39.12%. The disagreement between these products primarily occurs in transitional zones with mixed land cover types or in mountain areas. Overall, the GlobeLand30 and GLC-FCS30 products were found to be the most consistent and to have good classification accuracy in the EU, with the disagreement between the three 30-m GLC products mainly occurring in heterogeneous regions.",yes,"The study uses the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) dataset, which has European Union coverage, as a reference to evaluate global land-cover products.",Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey;LUCAS

Based on Positive Mathematical Programming, IFM-CAP simulates the behaviour of each individual farmer in the EU-FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) database, under the policy constraint of crop diversification and provides distributional impacts over the entire EU farm population. Simulation results show that the effects of the crop diversification measure on the EU farming sector are rather small. At the aggregate EU level, the proportion of the reallocated area due to the diversification measure represents less than 1% of the total agricultural area and the crop production and income decline by less than 0.5%. At the individual farm level, the impacts could be more pronounced (more than -25%), although the number of affected farms by the measure remains small (around 5% of the total farm population).

Various Neolithic or Bronze age groups have been named as pioneer cultivators. These theses were tested by examining fossil pollen studies (FPSs), obtained from the European Pollen Database. Many FPSs report Cannabis or Humulus (C/H) with collective names (e.g. Cannabis/Humulus or Cannabaceae). To dissect these aggregate data, we used ecological proxies to differentiate C/H pollen, as follows: unknown C/H pollen that appeared in a pollen assemblage suggestive of steppe (Poaceae, Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae) we interpreted as wild-type Cannabis. C/H pollen in a mesophytic forest assemblage (Alnus, Salix, Populus) we interpreted as Humulus. C/H pollen curves that upsurged and appeared de novo alongside crop pollen grains we interpreted as cultivated hemp. FPSs were mapped and compared to the territories of archaeological cultures. We analysed 479 FPSs from the Holocene/Late Glacial, plus 36 FPSs from older strata. The results showed C/H pollen consistent with wild-type C. sativa in steppe and dry tundra landscapes throughout Europe during the early Holocene, Late Glacial, and previous glaciations. During the warm and wet Holocene Climactic Optimum, forests replaced steppe, and Humulus dominated. Cannabis retreated to steppe refugia. C/H pollen consistent with cultivated hemp first appeared in the Pontic-Caspian steppe refugium.

We present a cross-comparison and accuracy assessment of Google's Dynamic World (DW), ESA's World Cover (WC) and Esri's Land Cover (Esri) products for the first time in order to inform the adoption and application of these maps going forward. For the year 2020, the three global LULC maps show strong spatial correspondence (i.e., near-equal area estimates) for water, built area, trees and crop LULC classes. However, relative to one another, WC is biased towards over-estimating grass cover, Esri towards shrub and scrub cover and DW towards snow and ice. Using global ground truth data with a minimum mapping unit of 250 m(2), we found that Esri had the highest overall accuracy (75%) compared to DW (72%) and WC (65%). Across all global maps, water was the most accurately mapped class (92%), followed by built area (83%), tree cover (81%) and crops (78%), particularly in biomes characterized by temperate and boreal forests. The classes with the lowest accuracies, particularly in the tundra biome, included shrub and scrub (47%), grass (34%), bare ground (57%) and flooded vegetation (53%).

Francisco; Schmutz, Ulrich",2024,"CONTEXT: Small woody features (SWF), as field boundaries, hedgerows, or riparian buffers, are crucial for agricultural landscapes and, frequently, disregarded. In combination with agricultural land uses they are considered agroforestry systems (AF SWF ), but their spatial distribution and detailed location of SWF types are insufficiently known in the EU as to support agricultural policies or enhance the development of farming practices for biodiversity conservation or productivity management. OBJECTIVE: In addressing this, the LUCAS 2015 dataset was analysed across EU member states to identify, characterise, and determine the extent and distribution of AF SWF classes and the variety of SWF types in agricultural lands. Additionally, a comparison between AF SWF and common agroforestry systems (AF C ), such as silvopastoral, silvoarable, grazed or intercropped permanent crops, and kitchen gardens was conducted. METHODS: To achieve this, four categories of AF SWF were established based on the classes of land cover within agricultural areas where SWF are present: arable crops AF SWF , grazed grasslands AF SWF , ungrazed grasslands AF SWF , and permanent crops AF SWF . The typology and relevance of the AF SWF categories and the SWF types were analysed and mapped at country level and by biogeographical regions. The spatial distribution of AF SWF and the different types of SWF were analysed using density maps. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results reveal that AF SWF cover 443,770 km 2 (10% of the EU-28 and 25% of the utilised agricultural area). This area encompasses arable crops (44%), ungrazed grasslands (24%), grazed grasslands (23%), and permanent crops (8%). The extent of AF SWF is 3.3 times larger than AF C (132,317 km 2 ), being mainly concentrated in Ireland, United Kingdom, France, Denmark, and Germany, while AF C prevail in the Mediterranean. As regards to SWF types, both managed and unmanaged hedgerows were dominant in France, Great Britain, and Ireland. Heaths and shrubs in Spain and Germany. Grove and woodlands margins in Spain, while avenue trees were dominant in Germany. Single trees and conifer hedges, the less prevalent SWF types, were broadly distributed. SIGNIFICANCE: This pioneering research addresses a knowledge gap, thoroughly documenting AF SWF , revealing both its types and spatial distribution. The findings highlight substantial disparities in AF SWF prevalence among member states of the EU. The study compares AF SWF with AF C in relevance and distribution, significantly contributing to better understanding agroforestry systems and offering baselines for future monitoring and management. Findings advocate for policy incentives and increased awareness among farmers to foster the understanding of the impacts of SWF on productivity and biodiversity.",yes,"The research analyzes the LUCAS 2015 dataset across EU member states to identify and map agroforestry systems, meeting the European coverage criterion.",LUCAS

However, deepening water-table depths (WTD) from climate change or human-induced drainage could stimulate decomposition resulting in peatlands turning from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Contemporary WTD ranges of testate amoebae (TA) are commonly used to predict past WTD in peatlands using quantitative transfer function models. Here we present, for the first time, a study comparing TA-based WTD reconstructions to instrumentally monitored WTD and hydrological model predictions using the MILLENNIA peatland model to examine past peatland responses to climate change and land management. Although there was very good agreement between monitored and modeled WTD, TA-reconstructed water table was consistently deeper. Predictions from a larger European TA transfer function data set were wetter, but the overall directional fit to observed WTD was better for a TA transfer function based on data from northern England. We applied a regression-based offset correction to the reconstructed WTD for the validation period (1931-2010). We then predicted WTD using available climate records as MILLENNIA model input and compared the offset-corrected TA reconstruction to MILLENNIA WTD predictions over an extended period (1750-1931) with available climate reconstructions. Although the comparison revealed striking similarities in predicted overall WTD patterns, particularly for a recent drier period (1965-1995), there were clear periods when TA-based WTD predictions underestimated (i.e. drier during 1830-1930) and overestimated (i.e. wetter during 1760-1830) past WTD compared to MILLENNIA model predictions. Importantly, simulated grouse moor management scenarios may explain the drier TA WTD predictions, resulting in considerable model predicted carbon losses and reduced methane emissions, mainly due to drainage. This study demonstrates the value of a site-specific and combined data-model validation step toward using TA-derived moisture conditions to understand past climate-driven peatland development and carbon budgets alongside modeling likely management impacts.",no,"While a 'European TA transfer function data set' is mentioned, the primary focus and validation data are from northern England, which is national/local.

H.",2016,"Population and consumption growth causes a 50% greater demand for food and fiber in the next 35 years. This causes increasing pressure on agricultural production often accompanied by an increasingly degraded environment. To overcome this problem, the concept of sustainable intensification (SI) was introduced. The concept recognizes the need to simultaneously increase agricultural productivity and further reduce negative environmental impacts. So far, the importance of soil and its natural resilience was not included into the studies of SI. The aim of this study was to identify and localize arable soils with a high potential of recovery after disturbances (i.e. resilience) in Europe. Therefore, in a first step we attributed the new LUCAS 2009 topsoil data from 25 EU member states to the arable land in the Corine Land Use Cover 2006 data set as well as to the European digital soil map (ESDB). This resulted in the identification of 671,672 km(2), approximately two-thirds of the total arable land in Europe. In a second step, a recently established classification scheme based on 6 intrinsic soil and land indicators (i.e. soil pH, contents of soil organic carbon and clay plus silt, cation exchange capacity, soil depth, slope) was applied to the arable land. These six measured soil indicators try to comprise the main biochemical and physical soil properties influencing soil resilience. The results show that from a soil perspective, almost half (44%) of the investigated arable land cannot be recommended for SI. More than 3% of this area should be de intensified in order to reduce environmental harm. 16% of the arable land can be recommended for SI with restrictions, whereas 40% of arable land has the potential for SI without impacting the delivery of goods and services provided by soils. The application of the presented classification scheme on a local study area (1.56 km(2)) in Central Europe revealed clearly that for any final decisions on SI it is important to consider the heterogeneity of soil at the local scale. Our results of this and a previous study demonstrate that the presented classification scheme can be used on different scales including the local, regional and continental scale.

Here, we conducted a systematic review of the Scopus and other literature databases focusing on Central European and UK studies examining (1) the influence of hedgerow habitat quality on the biodiversity of arthropods, earthworms, birds, bats and small mammals and (2) the relationship between selected hedgerow parameters, animal taxa, and ecosystem services such as pollination, seed dispersal, pest and disease control and soil quality regulation.

Arthropods, birds, and small mammals were studied most frequently, earthworms and bats least frequently. The selected studies showed that structural diversity, layering, woody biomass and density were strongly positively correlated with animal species diversity, while hedgerow length, width and age showed less relevant relationships. Hedgerow connectivity, density, structural diversity, and layering were strongly positive associated with the provision of ecosystem services.

The nutrient content of water can be decreased by reducing nitrogen emission. In this article a novel approach is applied to the evaluation of the impact of Agri Environmental Measures (AEM), which are part of axis 2 of the EU Rural Development Programme. The spending on AEM is linked to the reduction of nitrogen surplus, and hence, to the improvement of water quality. Reduction of nitrogen surplus is considered as a beta convergence process, in which the nitrogen surplus of EU member states converges to a steady state level. The convergence is tested, applying spatial econometrics on a panel data set of EU member states. The development over time of nitrogen surplus is explained applying the conditional beta convergence methodology. To allow for varying steady state nitrogen surpluses, structural variables are added to the analysis. RDP spending on AEM was added as structural variable to evaluate whether they affect the reduction of nitrogen surplus. The fixed effects panel data specification was tested to be the best model and preferred over spatial econometric specifications. A significantly negative effect is found between AEM expenditures and nitrogen surplus. Based on these estimation results it can be concluded that spending on AEM affects the convergence of nitrogen surplus towards a steady state level. A causal relationship cannot be tested with data on EU Member State level and additional analysis at smaller spatial level is warranted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The results were provided by four EU geographical regions, with a specific focus on wheat, lucerne, carrot, and apple. Although strong sector and regional differences currently characterise the organic seed market, organic seed demand considerably exceeds supply for most crops. Generally, farms in the central and northern regions revealed a higher organic seed supply than those in the southern and eastern regions, and organic seed supply is higher for wheat than other crops. A significant output of this study is the development of recommendations to improve methodologies to increase the transparency and availability of organic seed market data.",yes,"The study is based on data from 'official EU datasets' and a survey conducted across the EU, fulfilling the European coverage requirement.",

We evaluated 105 giant ancient trees from Italy, Spain and Portugal and compared them with the European Union (EU) database of chestnut cultivars by using a set of 24 simple sequence repeats (SSRs; microsatellite markers). We measured the perimeter (girth) at the diameter at breast height (DBH). Samples from both the canopy and the roots of each tree were analysed to distinguish which trees were self-rooted and which were grafted. Diversity was compared using standard metrics and model-based approaches based on the expected heterozygosity (He) at equilibrium. We could differentiate 91 new genotypes; 9.6% matched known chestnut cultivars. We found the first evidences of cultivation, that is, grafting to produce instant domestication in Galicia and in the Douro Valley in trees of 14-m perimeter (15th century) and in the Basque Country (first report in that area) in a tree of 11.5-m perimeter (16th century). In Italy, the cultivar Marrone Fiorentino was found in some giant trees with perimeters of 8 and 9 m (17th-18th centuries) in the Toscana and Umbria. Those findings matched with written references in Portugal from the 16th century and from the 18th century in Spain.

Especially for bioclimatic modeling, knowledge of size, structure and green volume of the urban vegetation is essential. Manual mapping of vegetation structures is timeconsuming and cost-intensive and can only ever be carried out in locally limited study areas. Active and passive remote sensing technologies in combination with automated methods for information extraction offer the opportunity to record the green structure in urban areas differentiated according to vegetation types. The new globally and freely available data provided by the European Copernicus Program raises the question whether these data are suitable for mapping and quantifying the urban green structure, including an accuracy estimation. Previous studies on the usability of Sentinel-2 data for vegetation analysis were essentially limited to crop and tree species classification in open space. The approach presented here thus considers for the first time the application of this data in a purely urban environment. Here we present a modeling approach based on multiple regression models. A Sentinel-2A scene from July 4, 2015 covering the greater Dresden area served as the input data set. After atmospheric correction of the satellite image scene 10 spectral channels were available. A high-resolution vegetation cover model with a grid width of 50 cm was available as a reference data set for the entire study area (City of Dresden, Germany). This takes into account the vegetation classes deciduous trees, conifers, shrubs, low (grassy) vegetation and arable land. Thus the area share of these vegetation types could be determined aggregated for each pixel of the satellite image scene. In addition, vegetation indices (NDVI and others) were calculated using suitable channels. For the prediction of each vegetation class, estimation equations were drawn up and evaluated with regard to their quality. Especially for deciduous and coniferous trees, satisfactory model quality values could be obtained, so that the green component prediction in these cases represents a useful basis for the determination of the green structure at the building block level in urban areas.",no,"The primary data source, Sentinel-2, has global coverage, not exclusively European.

Seventy sites located within the upper 50th percentile of leaching vulnerability from this modelling exercise, crop density and shallow groundwater were selected for monitoring groundwater.Retrospective and prospective pinoxaden product applications at candidate sites were recorded and these data used to place sites in the distribution for Europe. The 70 sites all fulfil the site assessment criteria and have no confining layers which may prevent or delay leaching.

Land management for carbon sequestration is most often informed by bulk soil carbon inventories, without considering the form in which carbon is stored, its capacity, persistency and nitrogen demand. Here, we present coupling of European-wide databases with soil organic matter physical fractionation to determine continental-scale forest and grassland topsoil carbon and nitrogen stocks and their distribution between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter pools. Grasslands and arbuscular mycorrhizal forests store more soil carbon in mineral-associated organic carbon, which is more persistent but has a higher nitrogen demand and saturates. Ectomycorrhizal forests store more carbon in particulate organic matter, which is more vulnerable to disturbance but has a lower nitrogen demand and can potentially accumulate indefinitely. The share of carbon between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter and the ratio between carbon and nitrogen affect soil carbon stocks and mediate the effects of other variables on soil carbon stocks. Understanding the physical distribution of organic matter in pools of mineral-associated versus particulate organic matter can inform land management for nitrogen-efficient carbon sequestration, which should be driven by the inherent soil carbon capacity and nitrogen availability in ecosystems.",yes,The paper uses European-wide databases to study continental-scale soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in forests and grasslands.,

According to the new data requirements, which came into force in 2014 for active substances and in 2016 for plant protection products, the chronic earthworm toxicity test with Eisenia fetida based on reproductive, growth, and behavioral effects instead of the acute earthworm toxicity test based on mortality, has to be conducted routinely. Additional testing of effects on soil arthropods (Folsomia candida, Hyposaspis aculeifer) is required if the risk assessment of foliar applications raises concerns regarding non-target foliar arthropods (Aphidius rhopalosiphi, Typhlodromus pyri) or if the product is applied directly on or into the soil. Thus, it was investigated whether the sublethal earthworm endpoint is more sensitive than the sublethal soil arthropod endpoint for different types of pesticides and whether the risk assessment for non-target arthropods would trigger the testing of effects on soil arthropods in the cases where soil arthropods are more sensitive than earthworms. Toxicity data were obtained from Swiss ecotoxicological database, EFSA Conclusions and scientific literature.

QTL models for MPPs can also be characterized by the homo- or heterogeneity of variance for polygenic effects. The most suitable model for the origin of the QTL effect and the homo- or heterogeneity of polygenic effects may be a function of the genetic distance distribution between the parents of MPPs. We investigated the statistical properties of various QTL detection models for MPPs taking into account the genetic distances between the parents of the MPP. We evaluated models with different assumptions about the QTL effect and the form of the residual term using cross validation.

However, as deduced from open data published by the European Environmental Agency, the availability of measurements of NH3 concentrations is very scarce, with very few countries in Europe reporting data consistently for extensive periods, this being especially true for urban background sites. In this framework, simultaneous multi-site measurements were carried out in NE (Northeast) Spain from 2011 to 2020, using diffusion tubes. The highest NH3 concentrations were recorded at the traffic site (5.3 mu gm(-3) on average), followed by those measured at the urban background site (2.1 mu gm(-3)). Mean concentrations at the mountain site were 1.6 mu gm(-3), while the lowest concentrations were recorded at the regional site (0.9 mu gm(-3)). This comparison highlights traffic emissions as an important source of NH3. A statistically significant time trend of this pollutant was observed at the urban background site, increasing by 9.4% per year. A season-separated analysis also revealed a significant increasing trend at the mountain site during summer periods, probably related with increasing emissions from agricultural/ livestock activities. These increases in NH3 concentrations were hypothesized to be responsible for the lack of a decreasing trend of NO3- concentrations at the monitoring sites, in spite of a markedly reduction of NO2 during the period, especially at the urban background. Thus, this would in turn affect the effectiveness of current action plans to abate fine aerosols, largely made up of secondary compounds. Actions to reduce NH3 concentrations at urban backgrounds are challenging though, as predicting NH3 is subjected to a high uncertainty and complexity due to its dependence on a variety of factors. This complexity was clearly indicated by the application of a decision tree algorithm to find the parameters better predicting NH3 at the urban background under study. O-3, NO, NO2, CO, SO2 and OM + EC concentrations, together with meteorological indicators, were used as independent variables, obtaining no combination of parameters evidently able to predict significant differences in NH3 concentrations, with a coefficient of determination between real and predicted measurements lower than 0.50.

The success of such approaches depends on the choice of source material. Thus, the analysis of different strategies for sampling allelic variation from landraces and their impact on population diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) is required to ensure the efficient utilization of diversity. We investigated the impact of different sampling strategies on diversity parameters and LD based on high-density genotypic data of 35 European maize landraces each represented by more than 20 individuals. On average, five landraces already captured similar to 95% of the molecular diversity of the entire dataset. Within landraces, absence of pronounced population structure, consistency of linkage phases and moderate to low LD levels were found. When combining data of up to 10 landraces, LD decay distances decreased to a few kilobases. Genotyping 24 individuals per landrace with 5k SNPs was sufficient for obtaining representative estimates of diversity and LD levels to allow an informed pre-selection of landraces. Integrating results from European with Central and South American landraces revealed that European landraces represent a unique and diverse spectrum of allelic variation. Sampling strategies for harnessing allelic variation from landraces depend on the study objectives. If the focus lies on the improvement of elite germplasm for quantitative traits, we recommend sampling from pre-selected landraces, as it yields a wide range of diversity, allows optimal marker imputation, control for population structure and avoids the confounding effects of strong adaptive alleles.",no,"The study integrates data from European landraces with Central and South American landraces, making the scope global, not exclusively European.",

One assumption of the Tier 1 long-term risk assessment of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is that residues of pesticides on treated seeds do not decline over time after seeding. Consequently, a time-weighted average factor (f(TWA)) of 1 (i.e., no dissipation) is used to calculate residue concentrations on seeds. In contrast, for spray applications, a default dissipation half-life (DT50) of 10 days is considered corresponding to an f(TWA) of 0.53. The aim of this study was to establish a default f(TWA) for treated seeds based on 29 industry-conducted seed dissipation studies, providing 240 datasets covering different active substances, crops, and regions. For f(TWA) calculation, two approaches were used: (i) kinetic fitting and (ii) using measured data without kinetic fitting. From kinetic fitting, 145 reliable DT50 values were obtained. Because there were no significant differences in DT50 values between crops and between the central and southern EU, the DT50 data from all studies were pooled. The geometric mean DT50 was 3.8 days and the 90th percentile was 13.0 days, corresponding to 21-day f(TWA) values of 0.27 and 0.59, respectively. Twenty-one-day f(TWA) values could be calculated directly from measured residues for 204 datasets. The resulting 21-day f(TWA) values were comparable with those from kinetic fitting (geometric mean: 0.29, 90th percentile: 0.59). The results demonstrate that residue decline on seeds is comparable with foliar dissipation after spray applications. Therefore, the risk assessment scheme by EFSA should implement a default f(TWA) < 1.0 in the Tier 1 risk assessment for treated seeds (e.g., either 0.53 as for foliage or 0.59, the 90th percentile f(TWA) in seeds reported in this study).

We conducted an online survey to examine whether trained users' opinions of the WQ protocol for dairy cattle correspond with the integrated scores (criteria, principles, and overall categorization) calculated according to the WQ protocol. First, the trained users' scores (n = 8-15) for reliability and validity and their ranking of the importance of all measures for herd welfare were compared with the degree of actual effect of these measures on the WQ integrated scores. Logistic regression was applied to identify the measures that affected the WQ overall welfare categorization into the not classified or enhanced categories for a database of 491 European herds. The smallest multivariate model maintaining the highest percentage of both sensitivity and specificity for the enhanced category contained 6 measures, whereas the model for not classified contained 4 measures. Some of the measures that were ranked as least important by trained users (e.g., measures relating to drinkers) had the highest influence on the WQ overall welfare categorization. Conversely, measures rated as most important by the trained users (e.g., lameness and mortality) had a lower effect on the WQ overall category. In addition, trained users were asked to allocate criterion and overall welfare scores to 7 focal herds selected from the database (n = 491 herds). Data on all WQ measures for these focal herds relative to all other herds in the database were provided. The degree to which expert scores corresponded to each other, the systematic difference, and the correspondence between median trained-user opinion and the WQ criterion scores were then tested. The level of correspondence between expert scoring and WQ scoring for 6 of the 12 criteria and for the overall welfare score was low.

Lack of access to phenotype information is still seen as a limiting factor for the use of plant genetic resources. Phenotype data are complex. Information on the context, under which they were collected, is indispensable, and the domain is continuously evolving. This study describes comprehensive data and object models supporting web interfaces for multi-site field phenotyping and data acquisition, which have been developed for Central Crop Databases within the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources over the years and which can be used as blueprints for phenotyping information systems. We start from the hypothesis, that entity relationship and object models useful for software development can picture domain expertise, similar as domain ontologies, and encourage a discussion of scientific information systems on modeling level. Starting from information requirements for statistical analysis, meta-analysis, and knowledge discovery, models are discussed in consideration of several standardization and modeling approaches including crop ontologies. Following an object-oriented modeling approach, we keep data and object models close together and to domain concepts. This will make database and software design better understandable and usable for domain experts and support a modular use of software artifacts to be shared across various domains of expertise. Classes and entities represent domain concepts with attributes naturally assigned to them. Field experiments with randomized plots, as typically used in the evaluation of plant genetic resources and in plant breeding, are in the focus. Phenotype observations, which can be listed as raw or aggregated data, are linked to explanatory metadata describing experimental treatments and agronomic interventions, observed traits and observation methodology, field plan and plot design, and the experiment site as a geographical entity.

Methods: the aim of this research was the evaluation of individual phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of the pulp of two varieties of persimmon (Rojo Brillante and Triumph) by an improved extraction procedure together with a UPLC-Q-TOF-MS platform. Results: the phenolic compounds composition of persimmon was characterized by the presence of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzaldehydes, dihydrochalcones, tyrosols, flavanols, flavanones, and flavonols. A total of 31 compounds were identified and 17 compounds were quantified.

Due to the impact of cities to energy consumption, the involvement of the local authorities in environmental policies is rapidly increasing. The Covenant of Mayors (CoM), launched by the European Commission, is an urban initiative aimed at reducing CO2 emissions. The signatories have to compile the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) balance of their territory and, to do so, they can use the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or the Life Cyde Assessment (WA). Moreover, the signatories have to define strategies to reduce the GHG emissions.In this context, authors estimate the GHG balance of an Italian municipality using both methodologies in order to compare the results. In detail, the first application is the IPCC, the second one is the LCA approach for which two cases are analysed: i) LCA with fossil fuels and electricity GHG emission factors based on the European Reference Life Cycle Database, LCA (I); and ii) LCA with a site - specific GHG emissions for electricity generation, LCA (II). They propose energy strategies in order to quantify the achievable GHG emissions reduction by the exploitation of the renewable energy resources. The study shows that the GHG emissions results obtained with the LCA approach are higher by 20% than those calculated with the IPCC approach. This difference is relevant and it could be significant in identifying effective climate strategies. The LCA methodology ensures a systemic accounting of emissions, then, it can be more effective in order to achieve GHG emissions reduction at global level. The examined energy strategies allow for reducing the GHG emissions of about 7% of the total reduction required by the CoM. This confirms that a preliminary evaluation of the strategies is useful for the allocation of the financial resources to the environmental policies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A large number of samples are being tested by organic certifiers, but the sampling methods often do not allow to determine if such residues stem from prohibited pesticide use by organic farmers, from mixing organic with conventional products, from short-range spray-drift from neighbour farms, from the ubiquitous presence of such substances due to long-distance drift, or from other sources of contamination. Eight case studies from different crops and countries are used to demonstrate that sampling at different distances from possible sources of short-distance drift in most cases allows differentiating deliberate pesticide application by the organic farmer from drift.

The approach is supposed to provide insight into the environmental impact of a specific production chain in an efficient manner by applying pragmatic data collection throughout the chain. This is achieved by allocating the environmental impact of each of the production sites to the product of interest using straightforward allocation rules.The cradle-to-gate (up to retail) environmental impact of pork was determined by life cycle assessment (LCA), in line with the product and organisation environmental footprint guidelines (PEF and OEF; European Commission 2013b). Foreground data was gathered at a feed production site, two farmers, a slaughterhouse and a meat processing site. All foreground operations are part of the same pork production chain in Belgium. The chain was completed using background data from Ecoinvent v3.01 (Wernet et al. 2016), Agri-Footprint v1.0 (Blonk 2014), European Life Cycle Database v3.0, LCA Food Database (Nielsen et al. 2003) and OEF Sector Rules Retail (Humbert et al. 2015b). The impact was quantified using the international reference life cycle data system (ILCD) midpoint method for 14 impact categories, but focussing on climate change.The total carbon footprint of the cradle-to-gate pork production system equals 0.46 kg CO2-eq. (100 g pork)(-1). This result is quite similar to that of earlier studies analysing the pork production chain: 0.58 and 0.57 kg CO2-eq. (100 g pork)(-1) (Bracquen, et al. 2011, Agri-Footprint 2014). Most of the carbon footprint was caused by feed production and more specifically, by the feed ingredients and their transport. Grains, soy and palm oil have the largest impact contributions. The farms are responsible for most of the remaining impact. N2O and CH4 emissions are the largest cause of greenhouse gas emissions at the farms. Also, in the other 13 considered impact categories, feed production and farming are responsible for more than half of the total impact, mostly followed by meat processing.Applying the chain-OEF approach in this study has shown that a chain LCA can be performed successfully and pragmatic data collection allows obtaining LCA results relatively fast, especially for small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The research on relations between production factors is very complex, thus the paper focuses only on some areas of the issue, such as: labor productivity and its dependency on technical equipment of labor or agrarian structure (approximate land-labor ratio) and the dependency of capital-labor and land-labor ratios on production factors.

M.; Halewood, Michael",2023,"Plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA) are the building blocks upon which global food and nutrition security depend and are key to plant breeding for more resistant crops, but how available are they? To understand what PGRFA are available under the mechanisms created by the International Plant Treaty's access and benefit-sharing, we conducted a comparative analysis of the five largest sources of pooled global data concerning PGRFA, including data conserved by and available to users under the Plant Treaty's access and benefit-sharing (ABS) mechanism. These data sources were the registry of notification letters maintained by the Plant Treaty Secretariat and four international PGRFA databases: Genesys, European Search Catalogue for Plant Genetic Resources (EURISCO), World Information and Early Warning System on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (WIEWS) and Global Information System on PGRFA (GLIS). Our analysis revealed that a comprehensive and consistent overview of the PGRFA available under the Plant Treaty's ABS conditions is not available. The GLIS is the most logical longer-term candidate to promote the provision of up-to-date and comprehensive snapshots of what PGRFA the Plant Treaty framework make available, primarily because it provides a mechanism (digital objective identifiers) to link together information from a range of information sources, including Genesys, WIEWS and EUEISCO and other online publications, and data sets concerning PGRFA in the multilateral system. Successful adoption of the GLIS could be promoted by creating novel incentives endorsed by the Governing Body to encourage Contracting Parties, Article 15 organizations, and individuals to share information about the materials they are making available under the Plant Treaty, in addition to the capacity-building for some GLIS users that is also necessary.

However, recent studies have found that such disparity is disappearing over time, particularly in the United States. This work offers the first longitudinal systematic assessment on the average income disparity between farm and non-farm units in the European Union, differentiating between old and new Member States. Using the EU-SILC dataset, both broad (having some farm income) and narrow (living mainly on agriculture) farm households are compared with a general sample of non-farm households and a more restricted sample of self-employed non-farm households. To control for household observable characteristics and time-constant unobserved factors, we use a fixed effects regression. Results suggest that the farm/non-farm income disparity has disappeared in the European Union unless we compare narrow farm households with all non-farm households: in this case, the former are more likely to be better off than the latter. A limited income disparity is found only in the case of new Member States for broad farm households only.

Through analysing EU databases, it was determined that only 2.65% of biogas is produced to what is possible. The biogas generation potential is quoted as 2.46 x 10(7) TJ in energetic value, which is juxtaposed by the current production estimates of 6.51 x 10(5) TJ in 2021. We summarise the current legislative landscape and biogas outlook, primarily showing that many waste systems become uneconomical due to high transport distances to industrial-scale, high-efficiency biogas plants. To reduce environmental impact and profit from waste-to-energy mechanisms, individual farms are to focus on small-scale local biogas plants to boost their self-sufficiency objectives. The main feedstocks present in agriculture have been analysed to evaluate the best performance parameter to provide insight into process optimisation. Through statistical analysis of 65 independent co-digestion studies of manure and ligno-cellulosic biomass systems, the carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N) is the most important factor to produce a high biomethane proportion in biogas. The ratio is equally crucial in the production quantity of biogas, as slight deviances may cause pH changes to either volatile fatty acid or ammonia accumulation. Modelling tasks showed that especially systems containing less than 50% manure show several correlations between pH, reduced volatile solids and C/N. Any inflection in pH yields inhibition as microbial performance reduces due to unfavourable conditions in the biogas reactor. It is apparent that anaerobic co-digestion of feedstocks is advantageous and using mixing regimes, larger implementation of low-cost pilot-scale digesters is advised in rural settlements. The behaviour of C/N, pH, solids retention time and manure proportion are discussed, showing that low C/N ratios of 15-25 are vital for good performance, whilst especially manure-heavy digestions perform better under higher pH conditions than comparative studies with more lignocellulosic biomass. The potential to degrade volatile solids (VS) is decreased substantially after more than 50% of manure have been added to the co-digestion.",maybe,"The abstract mentions analyzing 'EU databases' for agricultural topics, but does not specify which databases were used.",

Mountains have a peculiar response to large scale variations, documented by elevation gradients of surface temperature increase observed over many mountain ranges in the last decades. Significant changes of precipitation are expected in the changing climate and orographic effects are important in determining the amount of rainfall at a given location. It thus becomes particularly important to understand how orographic precipitation responds to global warming and to anthropogenic forcing. Here, using a large rain gauge dataset over the European Alpine region, we show that the distribution of annual precipitation among the lowlands and the mountains has varied over time, with an increase of the precipitation at the high elevations compared to the low elevations starting in the mid 20 century and peaking in the 1980s. The simultaneous increase and peak of anthropogenic aerosol load is discussed as a possible source for this interdecadal change.

This paper sought to monitor and assess the temporal and spatial distribution of drought severity across northern Algeria (excluding the Sahara) during the growing season from 2011 to 2022, while exploring the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) anomaly and climate variables (rainfall and temperature). Temporal NDVI data from the Terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite covering the period 2000-2022 and climate data from the European Reanalysis 5th Generation (ERA5) datasets collected during the period 1990-2022 were used. The results showed that a considerable portion of northern Algeria has suffered from droughts of varying degrees of severity during the study period. The years 2022, 2021, 2016, and 2018 were the hardest hit, with 76%, 71%, 66%, and 60% of the area, respectively, experiencing drought conditions. While the relationship between the NDVI anomaly and the climatic factors showed variability across the different years, the steady decrease in vegetation health indicated by the NDVI anomaly corroborates the observed increase in drought intensity during the study period. We conclude that the MODIS-NDVI product offers a cost-efficient approach to monitor drought in data-scarce regions like Algeria, presenting a viable alternative to conventional climate-based drought indices, while serving as an initial step towards formulating drought mitigation plans.",no,"The data sources used, MODIS and ERA5, have global coverage, not exclusively European.",

We show that the composition and diversity of fungal, but not bacterial, species is tightly coupled to both forest biotic conditions and a seven-fold variation in tree growth rates and biomass carbon stocks when controlling for the effects of dominant tree type, climate, and other environmental factors. This linkage is particularly strong for symbiotic endophytic and ectomycorrhizal fungi known to directly facilitate tree growth. Since tree growth rates in this system are closely and positively correlated with belowground soil carbon stocks, we conclude that fungal composition is a strong predictor of overall forest carbon storage across the European continent.Soil microbial diversity and composition is thought to play a major role in elemental cycling.

This is a necessary effort to complement more physically based assessments, which include as well the impact of human activities on landscapes.The analysis is carried out at different levels of governance: EU and regional, using an example from the Alentejo region in Portugal and EU wide databases, and addresses conceptual and practical questions: what type of societal landscape awareness can be monitored and by whom (e.g., individuals, specific social groups, society as a whole); what are the landscape dimensions that should be assessed; what are the limitations imposed by data-related constraints.

However, there is still a lack of sensing information that adequately represents root-zone SM for longer periods and larger spatial scales. One option for root-zone SM observation is terrestrial gamma radiation (TGR), as it is inversely related to SM. Hence, the near real-time data of more than 5000 environmental gamma radiation (EGR) monitoring stations archived by the EUropean Radiological Data Exchange Platform (EURDEP) is a potential source to develop a root-zone SM product for Europe without extra investments in SM sensors. This study aims to investigate to what extent the EURDEP data can be used for SM estimation. For this, two EGR monitoring stations were equipped with in situ SM sensors to measure reference SM. The terrestrial component of EGR was extracted after eliminating the contributions of rain washout and secondary cosmic radiation, and used to obtain a functional relationship with SM. We predicted the weekly volumetric SM with a root mean square error of 7%-9% from TGR measurements. Nevertheless, we believe that this technique, due to its greater penetration depth and long data legacy, can provide useful data complementary to satellite-based remote sensing techniques to estimate root-zone SM at the continental scale.An extensive early warning monitoring network for environmental gamma radiation (EGR) is maintained in Europe. Since soil moisture influences EGR, this database could be used to derive continental soil moisture products. To test this, two monitoring stations in Germany were selected and equipped with reference soil moisture sensors. From the terrestrial component of EGR, soil moisture was determined with an error of 7-9 vol.%.Information on the temporal dynamics of SM across a large area is vital for many sectors. An extensive network for monitoring EGR detectors that has been operated across Europe after the Chernobyl nuclear accident is a potential source for deriving continental-scale SM information without additional costs. We investigated how accurately SM can be estimated from the data of two of such detectors. The results showed that weekly SM estimates with an accuracy of 0.07-0.09 cm3 cm-3 are feasible after adequate data processing accounting for other factors affecting EGR. We also discussed possible sources that affected the accuracy of the SM estimates and provided directions for further research.

The population exposure remains thus difficult to estimate; therefore it was necessary to define modalities for implementing national monitoring of pesticides in ambient air in metropolitan France and in the overseas territories. The objective of this work was to identify which active substances (a.s.) have to be monitored in priority. As part of a collective expertise, a group of multidisciplinary experts has developed a method to rank active substances authorised as plant protection products, biocides and antiparasitic agents, which were available on the French market in 2015. A 3-steps approach has been developed. The first step consisted of a theoretical approach based on a hierarchy of substances according to four criteria: (a) national uses, (b) emission potential to the air, (c) persistence in the air, and (d) chronic toxicity. The three first criteria give information on their potential to be present in the atmosphere, and the fourth criterion allows to consider their potential of hazard. The second step was an observational approach based on existing database on pesticide air measurements in France. In the third step, both approaches were combined using decision trees to select priority pesticides. Among the 1316 a.s. first identified from the EU Pesticides database, 90 were selected, among which 43 required metrological and/or analytical development.

Although herbicides are the most commonly used pesticides worldwide, they have received less attention in this debate. We investigated the extent to which long-term trends in herbicide use in Austria influence potential toxic exposures to non-target organisms and potential risks to humans. We analyzed official sales data of 101 herbicide active ingredients (AIs) approved in Austria between 2010 and 2019 regarding their ecotoxicological properties based on lethal doses (LD50 and LC50) weighed by their persistence in the environment (DT50) for honeybees (Apis mellifera), earthworms (Eisenia fetida), and birds (Serinus serinus). Human health risks were qualitatively assessed based on official hazard statements for the AIs used. Results In Austria, herbicide amounts sold decreased significantly by 24% from 1480 to 1123 tonnes between 2010 and 2019. This also led to a considerable decrease in the amounts of AIs classified by H-statements of the EU Pesticides Database: - 71% acute inhalation toxicity, - 58% reproductive toxicity,- 47% specific target organ toxicity. Yet, 36% of herbicides used were still classified as highly hazardous pesticides according to the Pesticide Action Network. Surprisingly, over the same period, toxic loads to honeybees increased by 487% (oral exposure), while lethal toxic loads to earthworms increased by 498%, and to birds by 580%. This can be attributed to a shift toward the use of more acutely toxic and especially more persistent AIs. The most problematic AI for honeybees, earthworms, birds and humans was the highly persistent diquat. The further ranking of the most toxic herbicides varied considerably depending on the organism. It is important to note that this toxic load assessment, like official environmental risk assessments, evaluates the potential risk but not the actual fatalities or real-world exposure. Conclusions Our results show a trade-off between herbicide amounts and toxicological hazards to humans and other non-target organisms.

The lowest overall classification error (2.3%) was reached with a subpanel including only 398 SNPs (ranked based on their mean decrease accuracy), with no classification error in seven breeds using up to 49 SNPs. Several SNPs of these selected subpanels were in genomic regions in which previous studies had identified signatures of selection or genes associated with morphological or production traits that distinguish the analysed breeds. Therefore, even if these approaches have not been originally designed to identify signatures of selection, the obtained results showed that they could potentially be useful for this purpose.",yes,"The paper uses a database of 23 European pig breeds, which is a European-level agricultural dataset, meeting all inclusion criteria.",

These three CECs were added to the EU watch list of emerging substances to be monitoring in 2013, which was updated in 2015 to comprise 10 substances/groups of substances in the field of water policy. A systematic literature review was conducted of 3952 potentially relevant articles over period 1995 to 2015 that produced a new EU-wide database consisting of 1268 publications on DCL, E2 and EE2. European surface water concentrations of DCL are typically reported below the proposed annual average environmental quality standard (AA EQS) of 100 ng/l, but that exceedances frequently occur. E2 and EE2 surface water concentrations are typically below 50 ng/l and 10 ng/1 respectively, but these values greatly exceed the proposed AA EQS values for these compounds (0.04 and 0.035 ng/l respectively). However, levels of these CECs are frequently reported to be disproportionately high in EU receiving waters, particularly in effluents at control points that require urgent attention. Overall it was found that DCL and EE2 enter European aquatic environment mainly following human consumption and excretion of therapeutic drugs, and by incomplete removal from influent at urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). E2 is a natural hormone excreted by humans which also experiences incomplete removal during WWTPs treatment. Current conventional analytical chemistry methods are sufficiently sensitive for the detection and quantification of DCL but not for E2 and EE2, thus alternative, ultra-trace, time-integrated monitoring techniques such as passive sampling are needed to inform water quality for these estrogens. DCL appears resistant to conventional wastewater treatment while E2 and EE2 have high removal efficiencies that occur through biodegradation or sorption to organic matter. There is a pressing need to determine fate and behaviour of these CECs in European receiving waters such as using GIS-modelling of river basins as this will identify pressure points for informing priority decision making and alleviation strategies for upgrade of WWTPs and for hospital effluents with advanced treatment technologies. More monitoring data for these CECs in receiving waters is urgently needed for EU legislation and effective risk management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Potato virus Y (PVY) is found worldwide, and is one of the main virus problems for potato growers. PVY is transmitted by aphids and mechanically by machinery, tools and people, and symptoms are variable across cultivars and strains, including being symptomless in some cultivars. Therefore, breeding resistant cultivars is the best way to control this virus. This study phenotypically screened 74 of the main commercial cultivars and a few other select cultivars grown in Australia, in order to identify sources of resistance to PVY. The cultivars were screened against PVYO and PVYNTN, with 23 out of 71 resistant to PVYO and 13 out of 74 resistant to PVYNTN, and all these 13 were resistant to both strains. When the phenotypic screening was compared to the results listed on the European Cultivated Potato Database, the majority of results were found to be consistent. We then evaluated three molecular markers RYSC3, M45, and STM0003 for the extreme resistance genes Ry(adg) and Ry(sto), to validate the usefulness of the markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS) on Australian germplasm. The degree of correlation between the resistance phenotypes and the RYSC3, M45, and STM0003 markers for Ry(adg) and Ry(sto) conferred PVY resistance was determined. Three cultivars amplified the RYSC3 marker, while the M45 marker amplified the same 3 and an additional 9. Of the 12 cultivars, 11 phenotyped as resistant, but 1 was susceptible. The STM0003 marker was amplified from only 2 cultivars that both had resistant phenotypes. The RYSC3, M45, and STM0003 markers were therefore able to identify all the 13 cultivars that were resistant to both strains of PVY. Therefore, these markers will enable the identification of genotypes with resistance to PVY, and enable PVY resistant parents to be used for the development of superior progeny; these genetic markers can be used for MAS in the Australian potato breeding program.",yes,"The paper uses the 'European Cultivated Potato Database' for comparison, which is a European-level agricultural data source, meeting all inclusion criteria.",European Cultivated Potato Database

Information was collected from a total of 272 situations in 16 European countries, including 170 situations related to EU protected designations (Database of Origin & Registration (DOOR) database) and 102 other situations related to high-quality products or differentiated production systems, in order to evaluate their potential sensitivity to the use of entire male pigs along four dimensions: BT_Inc, likelihood of increased levels of boar taint compounds compared with conventional production of entire males; BT_Per, extent to which (some of) the associated pork product(s) are susceptible to perception of boar taint by consumers; FatQQ, likelihood that the quality of (some of) the related products is decreased due to the lower fat quantity and quality in entire males; Manag, increased likelihood of animal management and welfare problems compared with conventional production of entire males. Situations corresponding to EU protected designations (DOOR situations) were on average more sensitive to entire male production but 11% of the non-DOOR situations were highly potentially sensitive, whereas one-third of the DOOR situations had low potential sensitivity. In total, 37% of the situations where castration is not formally specified as mandatory exhibited high potential sensitivity to entire male production. Three main patterns of situations were identified via ascending hierarchical clustering. A first pattern including 31% of the DOOR situations and 74% of the other ones, had potentially no increased risk compared with conventional production of entire males. A second pattern including 28% of the DOOR situations and 16% of the other ones had a high, moderate and low potential sensitivity for FatQQ, BT_Inc and Manag, respectively. The third pattern including 41% of the DOOR situations and 11% of the other situations had high potential sensitivity for BT_Inc and FatQQ, associated with moderate to high sensitivity for Manag. The approach used to evaluate the sensitivity to entire male pig production from the limited information collected for this study has many limitations. More precise approaches using more specific information are needed to evaluate the actual sensitivity of individual situations to the use of entire male pigs.

Candidate traits tested for their predictive value were those for which there was a mechanistic rationale that they could be determinants of the rate of resistance evolution.RESULTSA dataset of 61 European cases of resistance against single-site-acting fungicides was assembled. For each case, the number of years from product introduction to first detection of resistance (the FDR time) was quantified-varying from 2 to 24 years. Short and long predicted FDR times represent high and low resistance risk respectively. Regression analysis identified traits that were statistically associated with FDR time. A model combining these traits explained 61% of the variation in FDR time. Validation showed that this predictive power was highly unlikely to have occurred by chance.CONCLUSIONUnlike previous methods, trait-based risk assessment can be used to assess resistance risk for fungicides with new modes of action, when there is no prior knowledge of resistance behaviour. Risk predictions using the new method provide a more reliable basis for resistance management decisions.

Maize landraces represent a rich source of allelic diversity, but their efficient utilization in breeding and research has been hampered by their heterogeneous and heterozygous nature and insufficient information about most accessions. While molecular inventories of germplasm repositories are growing steadily, linking these data to meaningful phenotypes for quantitative traits is challenging.Here, we present comprehensive molecular and phenotypic data for similar to 1,000 doubled-haploid (DH) lines derived from three pre-selected European maize landraces. Due to their full homozygosity, the DH lines can be multiplied ad libitum and represent a powerful biological resource available to the community. The DH lines allow high-precision phenotyping in repeated experiments and reveal the full additive genetic variance of the population. The DH lines were evaluated for nine agronomically important, quantitative traits in multienvironment field trials comprising seven locations and two years. The DH populations revealed high genetic variance and high heritability for the analysed traits. The DH lines were genotyped with 600k SNP markers. After stringent quality filtering 500k markers remained for further analyses.This is the largest resource of landrace derived DH material in maize, unprecedented in its structure and dimension. The presented data are ideal for linking molecular variation to meaningful phenotypes. They can be used for genome-wide association studies, genomic prediction, and population genetic analyses as well as for developing and testing statistical methods.

However, intensification of agriculture and forestry in Europe has resulted in the degradation of peatlands and their biodiversity (i.e., species, habitats and processes in ecosystems), thus impairing water retention, nutrient filtration, and carbon capture. Restoration of peatlands requires assessment of patterns and processes, and spatial planning. To support strategic planning of protection, management, and restoration of peatlands, we assessed the conservation status of three peatland types within the trans-border Neman River basin. First, we compiled a spatial peatland database for the two EU and two non-EU countries involved. Second, we performed quantitative and qualitative gap analyses of fens, transitional mires, and raised bogs at national and sub-basin levels. Third, we identified priority areas for local peatland restoration using a local hotspot analysis. Nationally, the gap analysis showed that the protection of peatlands meets the Convention of Biological Diversity's quantitative target of 17%. However, qualitative targets like representation and peatland qualities were not met in some regional sub-basins. This stresses that restoration of peatlands, especially fens, is required. This study provides an assessment methodology to support sub-basin-level spatial conservation planning that considers both quantitative and qualitative peatland properties.

Several research studies have shown the impact of roads on the air quality in urban areas, but the relationship between road and rail networks and ambient PM10 concentrations has not been well studied, especially in suburban and rural landscapes. In this study, we examined the link between the spatial characteristics of each road type (motorway, primary road, secondary road, and railway) and the annual average PM10 concentration. We used the European 2931 air quality (AQ) station dataset, which is classified into urban, suburban, and rural landscapes. Our results show that in urban and rural landscapes, the spatial characteristics (the density of the road network and its distance from the AQ monitoring points) have a significant statistical relationship with PM10 concentrations. According to our findings from AQ monitoring sites within the urban landscape, there is a significant negative relationship between the annual average PM10 concentration and the density of the railway network. This result can be explained by the driving wind generated by railway trains (mainly electric trains). Among the road network types, all road types in the urban landscape, only motorways in the suburban landscape, and only residential roads in the rural landscape have a significant positive statistical relationship with the PM10 values at the AQ monitoring points. Our results show that in the suburban zones, which represent the rural-urban fringe, motorways have a strong influence on PM-related air pollution. In the suburban areas, the speed of vehicles changes frequently near motorways and intersections, so higher traffic-related PM10 emission levels can be expected in these areas.

Several strategies are available to mitigate GHG emissions, but producing milk with a low CF does not necessarily imply that a dairy farm is economically viable. Therefore, to understand the relationship between the CF of milk and dairy farm economic performance, the farm accountancy network database of a European Union nation (Ireland) was applied to a GHG emission model. The method used to quantify GHG emissions was life cycle assessment (LCA), which was independently certified to comply with the British standard for LCA. The model calculated annual on- and off-farm GHG emissions from imported inputs (e.g., electricity) up to the point milk was sold from the farm in CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq). Annual GHG emissions computed using LCA were allocated to milk based on the economic value of dairy farm products and expressed per kilogram of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). The results showed for a nationally representative sample of 221 grass-based Irish dairy farms in 2012 that gross profit averaged (sic)0.18/L of milk and (sic)1,758/ha and gross income was (sic)40,899/labor unit. Net profit averaged (sic)0.08/L of milk and (sic)750/ha and net income averaged (sic)18,125/labor unit. However, significant variability was noted in farm performance across each financial output measure. For instance, net margin per hectare of the top one-third of farms was 6.5 times higher than the bottom third. Financial performance measures were inversely correlated with the CF of milk, which averaged 1.20 kg of CO2-eq/kg of FPCM but ranged from 0.60 to 2.13 kg of CO2-eq/kg of FPCM. Partial least squares regression analysis of correlations between financial and environmental performance indicated that extending the length of the grazing season and increasing milk production per hectare or per cow reduced the CF of milk and increased farm profit. However, where higher milk production per hectare was associated with greater concentrate feeding, this adversely affected the CF of milk and economic performance by increasing both costs and off-farm emissions. Therefore, to mitigate the CF of milk and improve economic performance, grass-based dairy farms should not aim to only increase milk output, but instead target increasing milk production per hectare from grazed grass.",no,"The data used is from a single country (Ireland), which constitutes national, not European, coverage.",

The present study therefore aimed to assess the environmental impact associated with dietary intake across four European countries, and to explain sources of variations in environmental impact by energy intake, demographics and diet composition. Individual-level dietary intake data were obtained from nationally-representative dietary surveys, by using two non-consecutive days of a 24-h recall or a diet record, from Denmark (DK, n = 1710), Czech Republic (CZ, n = 1666), Italy (IT, n = 2184), and France (FR, n = 2246). Dietary intake data were linked to a newly developed pan-European environmental sustainability indicator database that contains greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and land use (LU) values for -900 foods. To explain the variation in environmental impact of diets, multilevel regression models with random intercept and random slopes were fitted according to two levels: adults (level 1, n= 7806) and country (level 2, n = 4). In the models, diet-related GHGE or LU was the dependent variable, and the parameter of interest, i.e. either total energy intake or demographics or food groups, the exploratory variables. A 200-kcal higher total energy intake was associated with a 9% and a 10% higher daily GHGE and LU. Expressed per 2000 kcal, mean GHGE ranged from 4.4 (CZ) to 6.3 kgCO(2)eq/2000 kcal (FR), and LU ranged from 5.7 (CZ) to 8.0 m(2)*year/2000 kcal (FR). Dietary choices explained most of the variation between countries. A 5 energy percent (50 g/2000 kcal) higher meat intake was associated with a 10% and a 14% higher GHGE and LU density, with ruminant meat being the main contributor to environmental footprints. In conclusion, intake of energy, total meat and the proportion of ruminant meat explained most of the variation in GHGE and LU of European diets.

WWTPs' selection was based on countries' dominant technology and a number of served population with the aim to get a representative holistic view of the pollution status. Samples were analyzed for 2248 chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) by wide-scope target screening employing LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. 280 compounds were detected at least in one sample and quantified. Spatial differences in the concentrations and distribution of the compounds classes were discussed. Additionally, samples were analyzed for the possible agonistic/antagonistic potencies using a panel of in vitro transactivation reporter gene CALUX (R) bioassays including ER alpha (estrogenics), anti-AR (anti-androgens), GR (glucocorticoids), anti-PR (anti-progestins), PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferators) and PAH assays. The potency of the wastewater samples to cause oxidative stress and induce xenobiotic metabolism was determined using the Nrf2 and PXR CALUX (R) bioassays, respectively. The signals from each of the bioassays were compared with the recently developed effect-based trigger values (EBTs) and thus allowed for allocating the wastewater effluents into four categories based on their measured toxicity, proposing a putative action plan for wastewater operators. Moreover, samples were analyzed for antibiotics and 13 antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and one mobile genetic element (intl1) with the aim to assess the potential for antibiotic resistance.

This study adds more knowledge as it aims to investigate the causal relationships between blue economic factors - living and non-living resources, ocean energy, port activities, shipbuilding and repair, maritime transport, coastal tourism, human development indicator, per capita income, fish capture, internal renewable water resources per capita, marine protected areas, greenhouse gas emissions and population density, all factors related to maritime activities - and the blue economy (BE) itself. MethodsIn order to reach these objectives, some special analytical and econometric methods are used. Among them the multivariate Granger causality theory, the correlation analysis and panel data techniques are employed. This set of methods helps us to study the complex set of relationships among the various factors related to the BE and their influence on per capita income (PCI) and economic growth. The data used to conduct this research were collected from the Eurostat, the E.U. statistical database. Several European countries and the span period 2010-2018 are used too. ResultsThe analysis showed evidence that per capita income is associated to other factors of the blue economy, that PCI (Granger) causes coastal tourism and population density, and that there are five other factors that positively influence PCI growth, namely, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), maritime transport, nonliving resources and ports' activities. This paper adds some new understandings to theory and calls the attention to society, in general, and the blue economics, in particular. For instance, if policymakers want to increase income per capita of these regions, they should take action on some variables such as human development indicator (HDI), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, living resources, maritime transport and ocean energy. The results reveal that blue economy is a good alternative to promote both economic growth and PCI. DiscussionThe concerns that make up the blue economy, such as ocean energy, port activities, ship building and repair, maritime transport, coastal tourism, HDI, maritime fish capture, marine protected areas, and GHG reductionare good factors to stimulate economic growth. Among these, the most influencing are maritime transport, living resources and the production of ocean energy. This study adds knowledge to theory, innovates in the methods and techniques used, in the results discovered, in its discussion, and in the mixture of blue economic factors, too. As far as we know, it is one of the first papers that fills this gap in the literature regarding the more and more important blue economy.",yes,"The paper uses data from Eurostat, an EU statistical database, to analyze factors including fish capture, which is related to agriculture and has European coverage.",Eurostat

Evidence from the transatlantic market,"Pawlak, Karolina; Smutka, Lubos",2022,"Accession of Poland to the European Single Market generated trade creation and diversion effects, which in turn resulted in a high degree of concentration of the Polish foreign trade in agri-food products with other EU countries. On the one hand, a high share of export to the markets of countries with a stable market economy is a confirmation of the Polish agri-food sector's capacity to compete on the foreign markets. On the other hand, when considering limited capability to increase food demand in the EU it provides grounds for the assumption that further export expansion to a considerable extent will depend on the potential expansion of sale to non-EU markets. In this context significant issues include diversification of target markets and search for prospective markets outside the EU, while they also determine directions of an advantageous export specialization. In the period up to 2021 the USA was the fourth non-EU export partner of Poland in the agri-food sector after the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Russia. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the level of comparative advantages of the Polish agri-food sector on the EU and US markets in 2004-2021 using Widodo's products mapping technique. The study used statistical data from the ComExt database of the European Statistical Office (Eurostat). The conducted studies showed Polish export specializations in the transatlantic trade, as confirmed by high comparative advantages, as well as a positive and steadily improving trade balances for food preparations, including meat, cereal, fruit and vegetable, as well as confectionery preparations, and less processed animal origin products (meat and offal as well as dairy produce). Poland had a disadvantageous competitive position in trade of products complementary in relation to domestic production, which import was necessary. In view of the comparative cost theory the directions of the realized export specialization were rational and should be maintained. While in trade with the other EU countries the competitive position of the Polish agri-food sector was weakened, it was strengthened on the US market. In view of the considerable EU market saturation the improved competitive capacity in the non-EU markets is a positive development, which is a promising finding particularly in the long-term perspective.",yes,"The paper uses the ComExt database from Eurostat, which is an agri-food data source with European coverage.",ComExt; Eurostat

IACS data contain annual plot-level information on cultivation and location of the land farmed by agricultural beneficiaries, covering the majority of farmland in the EU. The data thus provide infor-mation on land use that is spatially and temporally highly disaggregated. Researchers from a broad range of disciplines already rely on IACS data for various applications and EU member states must make an anonymised, geospatially-referenced version of the data publicly available in the future. However, there is no complete and structured overview of the data's use, their benefits and limitations that future research could rely on. This calls for conducting a systematic review of the applications of IACS plot -level data in scientific literature. Preparing the ground for such a review, this paper presents a review protocol for identifying and analysing publications using plot-level IACS data from Austria, Czechia, France, Germany, and Sweden in a systematic map. To test and refine the protocol and to illustrate the planned review, we conduct a pilot analysis of 12 selected academic publications and present the results.

An alternative to the VMS is represented by the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which in the EU became compulsory in May 2014 for all fishing vessels of length above 15 meters. The aim of this paper is to assess the uptake of the AIS in the EU fishing fleet and the feasibility of producing a map of fishing effort with high spatial and temporal resolution at European scale. After analysing a large AIS dataset for the period January-August 2014 and covering most of the EU waters, we show that AIS was adopted by around 75% of EU fishing vessels above 15 meters of length. Using the Swedish fleet as a case study, we developed a method to identify fishing activity based on the analysis of individual vessels' speed profiles and produce a high resolution map of fishing effort based on AIS data. The method was validated using detailed logbook data and proved to be sufficiently accurate and computationally efficient to identify fishing grounds and effort in the case of trawlers, which represent the largest portion of the EU fishing fleet above 15 meters of length. Issues still to be addressed before extending the exercise to the entire EU fleet are the assessment of coverage levels of the AIS data for all EU waters and the identification of fishing activity in the case of vessels other than trawlers.",yes,"The paper uses a large AIS dataset covering most EU waters to map fishing effort at a European scale, which meets all inclusion criteria.",Automatic Identification System (AIS); Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)

We evaluated the official EU pesticide database to compare 256 AS that may only be used on conventional farmland with 134 AS that are permitted on organic farmland. As a benchmark, we used (i) the hazard classifications of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS), and (ii) the dietary and occupational health-based guidance values, which were established in the authorization procedure. Our comparison showed that 55% of the AS used only in conventional agriculture contained health or environmental hazard statements, but only 3% did of the AS authorized for organic agriculture. Warnings about possible harm to the unborn child, suspected carcinogenicity, or acute lethal effects were found in 16% of the AS used in conventional agriculture, but none were found in organic agriculture. Furthermore, the establishment of health-based guidance values for dietary and non-dietary exposures were relevant by the European authorities for 93% of conventional AS, but only for 7% of organic AS. We, therefore, encourage policies and strategies to reduce the use and risk of pesticides, and to strengthen organic farming in order to protect biodiversity and maintain food security.",yes,"The paper uses the 'official EU pesticide database', which is an agricultural data source with European coverage.",EU pesticide database

Knowing which subclinical mastitis cases will become chronic at an early stage would be helpful in intervening in these cases. Automatic milking systems (AMS) can collect data on mastitis indicators such as conductivity, Somatic cell count (SCC), and blood in the milk for each milking. The aim of this study was to develop a sensor-based prediction model using SCC, conductivity, blood in the milk, parity, milk diversion, time interval between milkings, milk yield and DIM that forecasts the chronicity in subclinical mastitis cases after an initial increase in SCC. We used sensor data from 14 European and North American dairy farms (with herd sizes of lactating cows ranging from 55 to 638 cows and herd mean parities between 2.00 and 3.19) with an AMS and an online cell counter, measuring SCC. Typically, a threshold of 200,000 SCC/ml has been used to distinguish cows with subclinical mastitis from healthy cows. We used gradient-boosting trees and sensor data to forecast whether the SCC would decrease structurally below 200,000 SCC/ml in 50 days after the day at which the prediction was performed. Data from 30 and 15 days prior to the day where the forecast was made, was used. The model was trained on data from seven randomly selected dairy farms from the dataset and the data of the remaining seven dairy farms were used to estimate the predictive performance. These results were compared with two approaches that simulate how farmers would diagnose chronic mastitis with a simple prediction rule based on close-to-daily SCC (frequent sampling approach), and on less frequent monthly SCC (monthly sampling approach). We used accuracy, Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and Area under the Curve (AUC) as metrics to assess the forecasting performance of the chronic mastitis prediction model. On average, the forecast model, using 30 days of sensor data prior to the day of prediction, outperformed the approaches according to the accuracy (chronic mastitis prediction model: 0.888, frequent sampling approach: 0.848, and monthly sampling approach: 0.865), MCC (chronic mastitis prediction model: 0.712, frequent sampling approach: 0.630, and monthly sampling approach: 0.552), and AUC metrics (chronic mastitis prediction model: 0.964 and frequent sampling approach: 0.941) metrics. The results also indicate that shortening the input requirement from 30 days of prior sensor data to 15 days has a limited effect on the performance of the model. Overall, this study shows that it is possible with a high accuracy to predict the future chronic mastitis status using past sensor data and machine learning models.",no,"The dataset used covers farms in both Europe and North America, so it does not have exclusively European coverage.",

A.; Carvalho-Ribeiro, S.",2016,"Rural areas are changing through a process of multifunctional transition. New societal expectations, including countryside consumption and protection, increasingly determine the way rural space is used. There is a pressing need to grasp the new relative balance between these drivers of the rural space, in each particular area, in order to target public intervention. Tackling differentiation within rural space will definitely contribute to developing the potential and vocation of each area while supporting territorial cohesion. In this context, sound analytical knowledge that reveals and characterizes this differentiation is required and novel analytical approaches are needed for this knowledge to be obtained. Based on the conceptual framework proposed by Holmes (2006, 2012), this paper presents two methodological pathways for defining a typology of European regions that considers the multifunctionality of rural areas today and the relative weight of the dimensions of production, protection and consumption. The classification is produced at Nomenclature Territorial Unit NUTS 2 level, using information derived from European statistical datasets compiling different cartographic sources. One of the methods used to develop a typology was a clustering approach while the other method used was an expert-based analytical procedure. Even when the limitations stemming from the data available for the whole of Europe are considered, the results are encouraging. The results show two different regional distributions in Europe. These distributions, which have some similarities but also certain differences, both reveal the general characteristics of NUTS 2 regions and shed new light on the ways in which societal expectations for production, protection and consumption might be spatially reconciled. The expert-based approach seems to produce a more faithful classification. Both typologies result in most regions being classified as pluri-active, or complex or multifunctional, which may indicate that multiple modes of rural occupancy are widely found in each region and therefore that a more detailed scale of analysis would be more likely to enable evidence-based decisions to be made.

They have serious impacts on human health, daily life, and industrial and agricultural production, in addition to threatening the regional ecological environment and social economy. Based on meteorological observational data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 dataset for spring 2000-2021, we used the Lamb-Jenkinson circulation classification method to classify the three major areas influencing SDSs in northern China. We also used the k-means clustering method to classify the overall circulation pattern in northern China. Our results show that the circulation types favoring SDSs in the southern basin of Xinjiang are southwesterly winds (SW), cyclones (C), and anticyclones (A). The circulation types favoring SDSs in western Inner Mongolia and southern Mongolia are northwesterly winds (NW), northerly winds (N), cyclones (C), and anticyclones (A). The circulation types favoring SDSs in central Inner Mongolia are northwesterly winds (NW), northerly winds (N), southwesterly winds (SW), and anticyclones (A). The 500 hPa and surface circulation patterns in China can be divided into nine types. Among them, five dominant circulation patterns favor strong SDSs: a cold high-pressure region and cold front (T1), a Mongolian cyclone (T2), a mixed type of Mongolian cyclone and cold front (T3), a thermal depression and cold front (T5), and a cold front (T8). During 2000-2004, the T8 circulation pattern occurred most frequently as the main influencing circulation. From 2005 to 2010, the T3 and T8 circulation patterns dominated. Circulation patterns T1 and T3 dominated during 2011-2015 and 2016-2020, respectively. We analyzed the main circulation patterns for four SDS events occurring in 2021 by combining the Lamb-Jenkinson and k-means methods.

Contrary to general belief, the return of large carnivores does not always translate into higher compensation costs. We identify a tendency towards prioritizing compensation over prevention; only a few wealthy countries pay the majority of the money allocated for prevention programs to adapt husbandry practices to the presence of large carnivores. We conclude that programs mainly focused on paying large compensation amounts will often fail to build tolerance towards predators. To mitigate conflicts and optimize the cost-effectiveness of publicly funded measures, responsible agencies should be proactive, focus on prevention-based policies and periodically evaluate the effectiveness of compensation and prevention programs in an adaptive manner.

This article aims to construct a comprehensive convergent model for assessing the global and EU's progress, degree of consolidation and symmetry of agricultural economies towards climate neutrality in the context of key international green initiatives. Methodology / approach. This research employs both qualitative and quantitative analyses to assess convergence measures in the agricultural sector's carbon emissions. The quantitative component relies on the sigma and beta convergence models to evaluate international convergence in carbon emissions CO2 dynamics. The dimensions of modeling are as follows: global sample within 194 countries with reliable emissions data; European Union, focusing on convergence within the EU27 member states, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine. The time period covers open data from 1972-2022. The dynamics of sigma and beta convergence is determined for the points, namely UN Stockholm Conference (1972), UN Rio Conference (1992), Kyoto Protocol (entry into force in 2005), Paris Agreement (2015). Additionally, statistical indicators of variation, skewness, Gini and Theil indices were calculated for delineating global smoothness and the concentration of agricultural emissions. Results. The results of the study reveal an inertial and divergent trend of the agricultural economy towards decarbonisation, which slows down the overall movement towards  net zero due to the presence of clubs of lagging agricultural countries that increase emissions in violation of international agreements. The reduction in emissions skewness in recent years shows that more countries are  pulling  decarbonisation due to their high capacity to move towards net zero, but this is not enough. The EU is the most prominent example of accelerated climate convergence, but markers of its weakening in recent years are identified due to the inability of economies to maintain the pace of decarbonisation caused by economic constraints, technological barriers, policy and regulatory issues, and misunderstandings of climate neutrality goals. It is shown that the long-term decarbonisation capacity of the agricultural sector is the key trigger for a country to make a positive contribution to the global convergence towards climate neutrality. At the current stage, the pace of decarbonisation plays a much greater role for consolidating efforts in the agricultural economy and achieving climate neutrality than the initial level of emissions in the sector. Factors in this process include proactive compliance with global climate agreements, technology sharing and cooperation, digitalisation and smart agriculture, and green financing and investment. Its implementation requires a three-way integration of stakeholder actions, strategy selection and results evaluation. Originality / scientific novelty. The study's originality lies in its large-scale analysis of over 50 years of emissions dynamics and the context of five key green agreements that provided support for the green transition. It allows studying international convergence in agricultural sectors globally and within the EU. The novelty implies the integrated use of sigma and beta convergence models that identifies predictors of convergent and divergent processes and separates countries into leaders and laggards of agricultural decarbonisation. This approach provides a comprehensive view of modern climate policy, the impact of international green initiatives, and the position of individual towards climate neutrality in agriculture. Practical value / implications.The practical value lies in the ability to adjust climate policies for the agricultural economy's decarbonisation, facilitating the determination of prospective outcomes for achieving climate neutrality. The aforementioned factors facilitate the process of governmental decision-making. The assessment of international programmatic agreements' effectiveness is enhanced through these models. The study offers a framework for global convergence towards climate neutrality in agriculture, highlighting the importance of digital technologies and smart agriculture as significant factors in global convergence.",no,"The study uses a global dataset covering 194 countries, which does not meet the criterion for exclusively European coverage.",

Croatia is a pioneer in tuna farming in the Mediterranean and the only country that has the exclusive right to farm wild-caught juvenile tuna (8 to 30 kg). This paper identifies key challenges to the sustainability of current farming and fattening practices, primarily economic and environmental, and possible solutions to overcome these challenges. This paper analyses data on tuna catch and aquaculture production (FAO FishStatJ and EU-Eurostat database) and updates the latest literature on farming practices, production challenges related to biotechnical, economic and environmental issues, the market and current legislation in Croatia, as well as fattening in other Mediterranean countries. Tuna capture-based aquaculture is attractive to investors because it promises high returns, but the sustainability of intensive tuna farming and fattening is questionable and raises many ethical issues. Tuna farming and fattening relies on wild fish for stocking and feeding, and further expansion of tuna farming and fattening is limited by the size of wild tuna and small fish populations. To meet the growing global demand for tuna and to conserve wild tuna stocks, further investments are needed. The knowledge gained in Croatian tuna farming is valuable for future sustainable close-cycled tuna farming in the Mediterranean. Due to its good environmental status, the availability of small pelagic fish, the availability of a highly qualified and well-organised labour force, the good cooperation between producers and researchers, and the application of modern farming technologies, ABFT farmed in Croatia have high quality and a good reputation on the market. The main weakness of Croatian tuna farming is that the entire industry is dependent on the Japanese market, but this can be overcome by the possibility of product diversification for new markets, including the tourism industry.",no,"The paper uses the FAO FishStatJ database, which has global coverage, not exclusively European.",

This paper reviews current data available on antimicrobial use in farmed animals in the Republic of Ireland, including each of the major livestock production sectors; pigs, poultry, dairy, beef and sheep. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant published literature, and ongoing research was identified through the network of authors and searches of each of the research databases of the main agriculture funding bodies in Ireland. The varying quantities and quality of data available across each livestock sector underlines the need for harmonisation of data collection methods. This review highlights the progress that has been made regarding data collection in the intensive production sectors such as pigs and poultry, however, it is clear there are significant knowledge gaps in less intensive industries such as dairy, beef and sheep. To comply with European regulations an antimicrobial data collection system is due to be developed for all food-producing animals in the future, however in the short-term surveillance studies have allowed us to build a picture of current use within the Republic of Ireland. Further studies will allow us to fill current knowledge gaps and build a more comprehensive overview of antimicrobial use in farm animals in Ireland.",no,"The paper focuses on data from a single country (Republic of Ireland), which is national, not European coverage.",

Aims To quantify how scientific publications have used data from the first European Bird Census Council (EBCC) Atlas of European Breeding Birds, what the topics of these studies have been, and to identify key aspects in which a second European Breeding Bird Atlas will provide new opportunities for basic and applied science. Methods We searched Google Scholar to find papers published in scientific journals that cited the first atlas. We analysed the contents of a random selection of 100 papers citing this atlas and described the way these papers used information from it. Results The first atlas has been cited in 3150 scientific publications, and can be regarded as a fundamental reference for studies about birds in Europe. It was extensively used as a key reference for the studied bird species. A substantial number of papers re-analysed atlas data to derive new information on species distribution, ecological traits and population sizes. Distribution and ecology were the most frequent topics of studies referring to the atlas, but this source of information was used in a diverse range of studies. In this context, climate change, impact of agriculture and habitat loss were, by order, the most frequently studied environmental pressures. Constraints in the atlas, such as the poor coverage in the east of Europe, the lack of information on distribution change and the coarse resolution were identified as issues limiting the use of the atlas for some purposes. Conclusions This study demonstrates the scientific value of European-wide breeding bird atlases. A second atlas, with its almost complete coverage across Europe, the incorporation of changes in distribution between the two atlases and the inclusion of modelled maps at a resolution of 10 x 10 km will certainly become a key data source and reference for researchers in the near future.",yes,"The paper discusses and analyzes data from the 'European Breeding Bird Atlas', a dataset with European coverage relevant to agriculture and environmental science.",European Breeding Bird Atlas

Quantitative real-time PCR methods are usually applied for GMO quantification, but since a few years, digital PCR (dPCR) has been described as a potential alternative by quantifying DNA molecules directly without any standard curves. In this study, the performance of dPCR to quantify 9 GM-soya events and 15 GM-maize events was assessed. Following GMO validation guidelines, the trueness and precision were determined on high, medium and low levels of transgenic content. Results showed biases below +/- 25% and satisfactory precision data. Limits of quantification were determined for each GM-event and were between 12 and 31 target copies. The reliability of GMO quantification by dPCR was further confirmed by analysing several proficiency test samples. Overall, dPCR showed accurate and precise GMO quantification on all the tested GM-events, from high to low transgenic amount. With its ease-of-use, dPCR was found to be an appealing alternative technology for routine GMO testing laboratories.",no,"The abstract describes a methodology and does not mention a specific, reusable dataset with European coverage.",

Here, empirical CDF plots are used to compare results of four large (476-884 samples) national-to continental-scale inorganic water chemistry data sets: (1) European surface water, (2) European tap water, (3) European bottled waters as a proxy for groundwater and (4) Norwegian crystalline bedrock rock groundwater, all analysed at the same laboratory, albeit at different times. For many parameters (e.g., Ba, Cl (-), K, SO42-) median values and ranges are, given the differing origins and, in some cases, treatment processes of the waters, surprisingly comparable. Unusually high concentrations of some other elements (e.g., B, Be, Br, Cs, F-, Ge, Li, Rb, Te and Zr) appear to be characteristic of deeper-seated, mature groundwaters. Other influences that can be inferred include contamination from well construction or plumbing materials (Cu, Pb, Zn - in tap waters, bottled waters and Norwegian groundwaters), water treatment (Fe, Mn - in tap-and Norwegian groundwater), bottle materials (Sb - bottled waters). The empirical CDF plots also reveal analytical issues for some elements (excessive rounding, element interferences). The best reference for natural and uncontaminated 'water' is probably provided by the mineral water samples, representing 'deep groundwater' at the European scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

10.1016/j.telpol.2023.102574,Use of blockchain in the agri-food value chain: State of the art in Spain and some lessons from the perspective of public support.,"Martinez-Castaneda, Monica; Feijoo, Claudio",2023,"The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union, in effect since January 2023, seeks to differentiate products on quality, provide greater transparency on food origin, and on the transactions and the actors involved in the supply chain. At the same time, in Spain, the adoption of new technologies for the digitization of the agri-food sector has been proposed as a solution to address structural issues such as lack of competitiveness and innovation. In fact, systems using blockchain-related technologies for food control and traceability have seen great progress in recent years and, currently, the use of blockchain in supply chain management is almost doubling year on year. In this context, this paper investigates the level of development of blockchain technology in the agri-food sector in Spain and its applications for certifying food production conditions within the supply chain, and how it is supported by public policies. It identifies several challenges that need to be addressed for a widespread adoption could take place, such as data recorded on the blockchain, lack of standards, limited scope of projects, and integration of data capture automatically or with other technologies like RFID and AI. The document proposes to reorient public development policies to address these challenges, such as reusing data from, already in place, European data collections for production control and food traceability, educating users and stakeholders about the use of blockchain technology, and fostering legal and technical provisions which ensure system transparency to facilitate a successful implementation of blockchain.",no,"The paper's focus is on Spain (national level), not on the use or production of a European-wide dataset.",

The associations were assessed by multivariable multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for socioeconomic, anthropometric, and health variables.Results: In both genders, with increasing age, individuals were more likely to have a high salt liking (men, OR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.30; women, OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.19), whereas they were less likely to have a strong sweet liking (men, OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.91; women, OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.68). Current smokers (men, OR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.90, 2.78; women, OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.36, 1.66) and heavy drinkers (men, OR: 2.92; 95% CI: 2.37, 3.58; women, OR: 2.57, 95% CI: 2.22, 2.98) were more likely to like salt than nonsmokers and alcohol abstainers. Regarding the sweet taste, women smokers were less likely to like sweets (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.89). Highly uncontrolled eaters [men, OR: 2.39; 95% CI: 2.04, 2.80; women, OR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.99, 2.47) and highly emotional women (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.55) were more likely to have a high liking for sweets than slightly uncontrolled eaters and nonemotional eaters, whereas those with high cognitive restraint (men, OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.46; women, OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.60) and former weight-loss dieters (men, OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.70; women, OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.73) were less likely to have a strong sweet liking compared with those with low cognitive restraint and never-dieters.Conclusion: An unhealthy lifestyle that includes smoking and alcohol consumption may influence salt liking, and eating behavior may have an impact on sweet liking. Further research is needed to study the influence of individual factors and sensory liking on dietary intake and weight status.
