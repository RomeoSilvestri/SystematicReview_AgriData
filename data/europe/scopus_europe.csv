In this study, we develop and evaluate regional algorithms for detecting freezing precipitations in the Far East, utilizing the ERA5 reanalysis dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, along with standard meteorological observations for 20 cold seasons (September–May) from 2004 to 2024. We propose modified diagnostic algorithms based on vertical atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles, as well as near-surface characteristics. Additionally, we apply a majority voting ensemble (MVE) technique to integrate outputs from multiple algorithms, thereby enhancing classification accuracy. Evaluation of detection skills shows significant improvements over the original method developed at the Finnish Meteorological Institute and the ERA5 precipitation-type product. The MVE-based method demonstrates optimal verification statistics. Furthermore, the modified algorithms validly reproduce the spatially averaged inter-annual variability of freezing precipitation activity in both continental (mean correlation of 0.93) and island (correlation of 0.54) regions. Overall, our findings offer a more effective and valuable tool for operational activities and climatological assessments in the Far East. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diagnostic Algorithm; Era5 Reanalysis; Extreme Weather; Far East; Freezing Rain; Meteorological Observations; Accuracy Assessment; Air Temperature; Algorithm; Climatology; Data Set; Environmental Assessment; Extreme Event; Freezing; Meteorology; Relative Humidity","accuracy assessment; air temperature; algorithm; climatology; data set; environmental assessment; extreme event; freezing; meteorology; relative humidity","","","This work was supported by the Russian state budget theme 124022100080-0 and the program 123072000039-5 \u201CDevelopment of a climate monitoring system for the Russian Far Eastern seas and the northwestern Pacific Ocean based on multi-platform observations and operational hydrodynamic modeling\u201D.","Extratropical Cyclones and Associated Climate Impacts in the Northeastern United States, (2020); Huffman, George J., The supercooled warm rain process and the specification of freezing precipitation, Monthly Weather Review, 116, 11, pp. 2172-2182, (1988); Rauber, Robert M., The relative importance of warm rain and melting processes in freezing precipitation events, Journal of Applied Meteorology, 39, 7, pp. 1185-1195, (2000); Matsushita, Hiroki, A simple method of discriminating between occurrences of freezing rain and ice pellets in the Kanto Plain, Japan, Journal of the Meteorological Society of Japan, 86, 5, pp. 633-648, (2008); Lu, Zhengqi, Occurrence of Warm Freezing Rain: Observation and Modeling Study, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 127, 5, (2022); Klima, Kelly, Ice storm frequencies in a warmer climate, Climatic Change, 133, 2, pp. 209-222, (2015); Adhikari, Abishek, Remote Sensing Properties of Freezing Rain Events From Space, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 124, 19, pp. 10385-10400, (2019); Bragg, Don C., Impacts and management implications of ice storms on forests in the southern United States, Forest Ecology and Management, 186, 1-3, pp. 99-123, (2003); Klopčič, Matija, Ice-storm damage to trees in mixed Central European forests: Damage patterns, predictors and susceptibility of tree species, Forestry, 93, 3, pp. 430-443, (2020); Ivanov, Aleksandr V., Impact of Ice Rain on Forests of Russky Island, Russian Journal of Ecology, 55, 2, pp. 71-78, (2024)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22251154","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213458202"

Our study attempts to quantify this potential for agricultural purposes at a national scale, using GIS techniques, high-resolution spatial data, and recent climate data. The land evaluation methodology we applied in our study was developed in the 1980s by soil scientists from the National Institute of Research and Development for Pedology, Agrochemistry and Environmental Protection (ICPA) and it is still the official approach for the assessment of land suitability for crops in Romania. In our study, the application of the methodology is based on high-resolution spatial data including the 25 × 25 m resolution EU-DEM, the CHESLA climate database from which mean annual temperatures and precipitations were extracted for the 1990–2019 period, the digital soil map of Romania, the European LUCAS soil database. Firstly, we compared the evolution of mean annual temperatures and precipitations for 1961–1990 and 1990–2019 periods and found that there is a significant warming trend (an overall increase of 1.27 °C for the entire country, ranging from 0.9 °C to 1.6 °C) among the major landform units and a slight precipitation increase throughout the country (68.8 mm yr−1 for the whole country, ranging from 9.3 to 118.8 mm yr−1). Then, we applied the land evaluation methodology for the recent period (1990–2019), starting with the digital mapping of 15 land suitability factors, which were further aggregated to achieve the land suitability index and classes for the main agricultural crops of Romania (winter wheat, maize, sunflower, potato, and vine for wine). The results show that the most suitable landform units for wheat, maize, and sunflower are the plain areas (Romanian Plain, Western Plain) with LSI average values over 60. For potato, the suitable areas (LSI over 50–60) are less extended, being found especially in the intra-mountainous depressions and cooler plateau areas, while vines find very suitable conditions (LSI over 70) at the contact of the Romanian Plain and the Subcarpathians. To assess the model performance, we determined the shares of land suitability classes within the areas occupied by the specific crops. A second validation was carried out by correlating the total crop production at the county level with the cumulated LSI values. We found that, apart from potatoes, the model performs well for the analyzed crops. However, a methodological revision is necessary to accommodate temperature and precipitation values, which did not manifest in the reference climate period (1961–1990), but which are now part of the current climate of Romania. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Land Evaluation; Gis; Romania","","","","This research has benefitted from the support of the PN-III-P4-PCE-2021-1350 project, funded by the UEFISCDI program, Romania.","Land Capability Classification, (1961); A Framework for Land Evaluation, (1976); Global Agro Ecological Zones Gaez V3 0, (2025); Guidelines Land Evaluation for Rainfed Agriculture, (1983); Sonneveld, Marthijn P.W., Thirty years of systematic land evaluation in the Netherlands, Geoderma, 156, 3-4, pp. 84-92, (2010); Modelling of Agricultural Production Weather Soils and Crops, (1986); Principles in Land Evaluation and Crop Production Calculations, (1991); An Index for Rating the Agricultural Value of Soils, (2021); Storie Index Soil Rating, (1978); A New System of Soil Appraisal in Terms of Actual and Potential Productivity, (1970)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20734395","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213280216"

Despite its importance, the region faces the challenge of abandoned vineyard plots, caused, among other factors, by the high costs of maintaining vineyards on hilly terrain. To solve this problem, the European Union (EU) offers subsidies to encourage active cultivation, with the aim of protecting the region’s cultural and environmental heritage. However, monitoring actively cultivated vineyards and those that have been abandoned presents considerable logistical challenges. With 43,843 vineyards spread over 250,000 hectares of rugged terrain, control of these plots is limited, which hampers the effectiveness of preservation and incentive initiatives. Currently, the EU only inspects 5 per cent of farmers annually, which results in insufficient coverage to ensure that subsidies are properly used and vineyards are actively maintained. To complement this limited monitoring, organisations such as the Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e do Porto (IVDP) use aerial and satellite images, which are manually analysed to identify abandoned or active plots. To overcome these limitations, images can be analysed using deep learning methods, which have already shown great potential in agricultural applications. In this context, our research group has carried out some preliminary evaluations for the automatic detection of abandoned vineyards using deep learning models, which, despite showing promising results on the dataset used, proved to be limited when applied to images of the entire region. In this study, a new dataset was expanded to 137,000 images collected between 2018 and 2023, filling critical gaps in the previous datasets by including greater temporal and spatial diversity. Subsequently, a careful evaluation was carried out with various DL models. As a result, the ViT_b32 model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an average accuracy of 0.99 and an F1 score of 0.98, outperforming CNN-based models. In addition to the excellent results obtained, this dataset represents a significant contribution to advancing research in precision viticulture, providing a solid and relevant basis for future studies and driving the development of solutions applied to vineyard monitoring in the Douro Demarcated Region. These advances not only improve efficiency in detecting abandoned plots, but also contribute significantly to optimising the use of subsidies in the region. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abandoned Vineyards; Aerial Imagery; Agricultural Monitoring; Deep Learning; Image Classification; Vision Transformer; Fertilizers; Photointerpretation; Abandoned Vineyard; Aerial Imagery; Agricultural Monitoring; Automatic Classification; Comparative Analyzes; Deep Learning; European Union; High Costs; Images Classification; Vision Transformer; Aerial Photography","Fertilizers; Photointerpretation; Abandoned vineyard; Aerial imagery; Agricultural monitoring; Automatic classification; Comparative analyzes; Deep learning; European union; High costs; Images classification; Vision transformer; Aerial photography","","","This research activity was supported by the Vine&Wine Portugal Project, co-financed by the RRP\u2014Recovery and Resilience Plan\u2014and the European NextGeneration EU Funds, within the scope of the Mobilizing Agendas for Reindustrialization, under ref.

These gaps can inhibit scientific research as they impede the use of numerical models for agricultural, meteorological and climatological applications as well as introducing analytic biases. In this research, different machine learning techniques are evaluated together with traditional approaches to gap filling automated weather station data. When filling gaps for a specific data stream, data from neighbouring weather stations are used in addition to reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalyses of the global climate, ERA-5 Land. A novel gap creation method is introduced that provides 100% coverage in sampling the dataset while ensuring that the sampled data are randomly distributed. Gap filling across a range of different gap lengths and target variables are compared using a range of error functions. The variables selected for modelling are mean air temperature, dew point, mean relative humidity and leaf wetness.

We use a novel European Union (EU) wide satellite-derived product at 10 m spatial resolution to produce datasets of crop diversity across spatial (1–100 km) and administrative scales for the year 2018. We focus on the 27 EU countries and the United Kingdom. We define local crop diversity (α-diversity) at the 1 km scale corresponding to large farms or clusters of small-to-medium sized farms. Across countries, the α crop diversity ranges from 2.3 to 4.4 with the highest levels achieved by systems dominated by a high number of small farms (less than 10 ha on average). Computed at grid level aggregation, γ-diversity (the number and area of crops that are grown independently from the precise location, for landscape region, and country levels) increases rapidly from 2.85 at 1 km to 3.86 at 10 km and levels off 4.27 at 100 km. Such diversity levels are higher than that reported for the U.S.A., likely related to differences in farm structure and practices. β-diversity, the ratio of γ and α diversity, provides a measure of the diversity between agroecosystems and ranges from 1.2 to 2.3 across EU countries. Based on the magnitude and change of γ-diversity across scales, we classify countries’ diversity in four groups with possible consequences for regional to national agro-environmental policy recommendations, in particular the monitoring activities and indicator development of interventions for the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the EU. Forthcoming annual high-resolution continental Copernicus crop type maps will facilitate temporal comparisons. Various ecosystem co-variates are to be explored for deeper understanding of the link of crop diversity to agro-ecosystem services. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Common Agricultural Policy; Farm Size; Remote Sensing; Resilience; Agroecology; Common Agricultural Policy; Ecosystem Resilience; Environmental Policy; European Union; Remote Sensing; Spatial Resolution; Europe; United Kingdom","agroecology; Common Agricultural Policy; ecosystem resilience; environmental policy; European Union; remote sensing; spatial resolution; Europe; United Kingdom","","","","Aramburu Merlos, Fernando, The scale dependency of spatial crop species diversity and its relation to temporal diversity, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 117, 42, pp. 26176-26182, (2020); Beck, Hylke E., Present and future köppen-geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution, Scientific Data, 5, (2018); undefined, (2021); Bonneuil, Christophe, A new integrative indicator to assess crop genetic diversity, Ecological Indicators, 23, pp. 280-289, (2012); d’Andrimont, Raphaël, From parcel to continental scale – A first European crop type map based on Sentinel-1 and LUCAS Copernicus in-situ observations, Remote Sensing of Environment, 266, (2021); undefined, (2012); Di Falco, Salvatore, Agrobiodiversity, farm profits and land fragmentation: Evidence from Bulgaria, Land Use Policy, 27, 3, pp. 763-771, (2010); Donfouet, Hermann Pythagore Pierre, Crop Production and Crop Diversity in France: A Spatial Analysis, Ecological Economics, 134, pp. 29-39, (2017); Egli, Lukas, Crop diversity effects on temporal agricultural production stability across European regions, Regional Environmental Change, 21, 4, (2021); Elmqvist, Thomas, Response diversity, ecosystem change, and resilience, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 1, 9, pp. 488-494, (2003)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01678809","","AEEND","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198038178"

Error correction employed scene classification data, derived from the European Space Agency's area classification algorithms, and the NDWI index was used to exclude water-covered areas. Accuracy verification through an Error Matrix was conducted at 73 survey points with a 95% confidence level, adhering to the principles of statistical probability. The overall accuracy of the burned area classification was 82.19%. Agricultural burned areas in the study area were predominantly found mostly on flat terrain. in the eastern direction.

Changing dietary patterns is essential to reducing the substantial environment impact of agriculture and food production systems. We performed a cross-country comparison of dietary patterns and their associated environmental impact in Europe, including by sociodemographic factors. Methods. We analyzed pooled cross-sectional dietary records collected during 2010–18 from 10 European countries using the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Database (16 508 adults; aged 18–79 years). Each food consumed was mapped to the corresponding environmental impact data using the SHARP Indicators Database, which provides greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) and land use (LU) values of approximately 900 foods. Total diet-associated environmental impact was calculated for each person and averaged across multiple days. Multivariable linear regression models were used to compare diet-associated GHGE and LU between population subgroups (gender, age, education and diet type) with country-level fixed effects. Results. The mean dietary GHGE and LU per capita ranged from 4.0 kgCO<inf>2</inf>/day and 5.0 m2*year/day in Spain to 6.5 kgCO<inf>2</inf>eq/day and 8.2 m2*year/day in France. Diet-related GHGE and LU (per kg/food) were lower among females (2.6 kgCO<inf>2</inf>eq/day, B = −0.08, P < 0.01; 3.2 m2*year/day, B = −0.11, P < 0.01), older population aged 66–79 (2.6 kgCO<inf>2</inf>eq/day, B = −0.03, P < 0.01; 3.4 m2*year/day, B = −0.4, P < 0.01), people following vegetarian diets (1.7 kgCO<inf>2</inf>eq/day, B = −0.07, P < 0.01; 2.0 m2*year/day, B = −0.07, P < 0.01), and higher among individuals with secondary education (2.7 kgCO<inf>2</inf>eq/day, B = 0.05, P < 0.01; 3.6 m2*year/day, B = −0.05, P < 0.01). Conclusions. Environmental footprints vary substantially across countries, dietary patterns and between different sociodemographic groups in Europe.

The main objective of the current work is to introduce a methodological approach to quantify the impact of sewage sludge (SS) application on agricultural soils in the EU and the United Kingdom. Concentrations of heavy metals (HMs) (Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn) in agricultural land from Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) 2009 topsoil database were used as a baseline. Maximum quantities of SS that can be safely applied to agricultural lands were obtained by a modeling procedure was used to determine the maximum safe quantities of SS that can be applied to agricultural lands for each country within the European Member States and the United Kingdom. Accumulation of HMs in soils was modelled by using a representative SS composition, distributed over 10 successive years at 5 Mg ha−1 year−1 rate. Ecological risk impact was assessed by using both the single ecological risk index (E<inf>r</inf>) and the integrated potential ecological risk index (RI). Maximum quantities of SS applied on agricultural soils in EU + UK were estimated to be 45 Mg ha−1 at the country level. We found that 19% of agricultural land (around 28,471,900 ha) in the EU + UK shows a higher RI than moderate risk after long time application of the representative SS. We show that the combination of the HM concentrations from the LUCAS topsoil survey and assumptions on the SS composition and soil HM partitioning can be used to define the actual and potential soil pollution rate in EU + UK. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used by policymakers, farmers, regional authorities and other stakeholders, with possible adaptions based on local in-depth soil and SS knowledge. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Eu Soil Observatory; Heavy Metals; Lucas Topsoil Survey; Potential Ecological Risk Index; Sewage Sludge; Sewage Sludge Directive Revision; Soil Pollution; Activated Sludge; Agricultural Soil; European Union; Heavy Metal; Observatory; Risk Assessment; Sewage Treatment; Soil Pollution; Topsoil; Europe; United Kingdom","activated sludge; agricultural soil; European Union; heavy metal; observatory; risk assessment; sewage treatment; soil pollution; topsoil; Europe; United Kingdom","","","LUCAS Soil samples collected and analysed with the support of EUROSTAT, DG AGRI, CLIMA and ENV.

While co-analyses of hosts and pathogen genomes (co-genome-wide association studies) allow us to pinpoint the interacting genes, these do not reveal which host genotype(s) is/are resistant to which pathogen genotype(s). The knowledge of this so-called infection matrix is important for agriculture and medicine. Building on established theories of host-pathogen interactions, we here derive four novel indices capturing the characteristics of the infection matrix. These indices can be computed from full genome polymorphism data of randomly sampled uninfected hosts, as well as infected hosts and their pathogen strains. We use these indices in an approximate Bayesian computation method to pinpoint loci with relevant G×G interactions and to infer their underlying interaction matrix. In a combined single nucleotide polymorphism dataset of 451 European humans and their infecting hepatitis C virus (HCV) strains and 503 uninfected individuals, we reveal a new human candidate gene for resistance to HCV and new virus mutations matching human genes. For two groups of significant human-HCV (G×G) associations, we infer a gene-for-gene infection matrix, which is commonly assumed to be typical of plant-pathogen interactions. Our model-based inference framework bridges theoretical models of G×G interactions with host and pathogen genomic data. It, therefore, paves the way for understanding the evolution of key G×G interactions underpinning HCV adaptation to the European human population after a recent expansion. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","G×g Interactions; Host-pathogen Coevolution; Linkage Disequilibrium; Population Genomics; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Article; Bayes Theorem; Calculation; Consensus Sequence; Controlled Study; Diploidy; Gene Frequency; Gene Linkage Disequilibrium; Gene Locus; Genome-wide Association Study; Genotype; Hepatitis C; Hepatitis C Virus; Host Pathogen Interaction; Human; Immunological Memory; Leave One Out Cross Validation; Pathogenesis; Population Genetics; Population Structure; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Stochastic Model; Virus Mutation; Virus Resistance; Genetics; Hepacivirus; Virology; Bayes Theorem; Genome-wide Association Study; Genotype; Hepatitis C; Host-pathogen Interactions; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","Article; Bayes theorem; calculation; consensus sequence; controlled study; diploidy; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; genome-wide association study; genotype; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; host pathogen interaction; human; immunological memory; leave one out cross validation; pathogenesis; population genetics; population structure; single nucleotide polymorphism; stochastic model; virus mutation; virus resistance; genetics; Hepacivirus; virology; Bayes Theorem; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Hepatitis C; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","","","","Agrawal, Aneil F., Infection genetics: Gene-for-gene versus matching-alleles models and all points in between, Evolutionary Ecology Research, 4, 1, pp. 79-90, (2002); Anderson, Roy Malcolm, Coevolution of Hosts and Parasites, Parasitology, 85, 2, pp. 411-426, (1982); Andras, Jason P., Genome-wide association analysis identifies a genetic basis of infectivity in a model bacterial pathogen, Molecular Biology and Evolution, 37, 12, pp. 3439-3452, (2020); Andreakos, Evangelos Th, A global effort to dissect the human genetic basis of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection, Nature Immunology, 23, 2, pp. 159-164, (2022); Ansari, M.

This has resulted in increased pressure on surface water supplies, human consumption and socioeconomic growth. Although water management requires monitoring, a substantial amount of water consumption globally, including both groundwater and surface water, remains unmeasured. Madhya Pradesh (MP) has a very varied semi-arid geographical region in Central India. Recent studies have found that 36 out of 51 districts in the state of MP have been facing severe hydrological drought conditions. Despite the challenges in the MP region, there is little understanding of the permanent and seasonal changes in surface water and the overall availability of surface water resources in each district. Field-based monitoring of surface water bodies in large regions such as MP poses considerable difficulties. However, gaining knowledge about changes in the distribution of water on the Earth's surface across time and space can be enhanced by analysing data obtained via remote sensing. To understand the long-term changes in surface water in different districts of Madhya Pradesh, India, over the past 38 years, we analysed a publicly accessible global surface water dataset provided by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) European Commission. This dataset is based on Landsat imagery and covers the period from 1984 to 2021. This research study examines the associations between variations in the permanent surface water level and the extent of land being irrigated, the intensity of agricultural activities and the seasonal oscillations in surface water for several districts in Madhya Pradesh. The findings from this research will be beneficial for assessing several significant MP districts in terms of their water footprint and sustainable management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Sustainable Water Management; Water Resources; Climate Change; Surface Water Resources; Water Management; Agricultural Practices; Global Climate Changes; Human Activities; Human Consumption; Semi Arid; Surface Water Supply; Sustainable Agricultural; Sustainable Water Management; Water Dynamics; Waters Resources; Surface Waters; Rain; Ground Water; Agricultural Practice; Alternative Agriculture; Climate Change; European Commission; Human Activity; Landsat; Remote Sensing; Semiarid Region; Surface Water; Water Footprint; Water Management; Water Resource; Article; Drought; Global Climate; Good Agricultural Practice; Imagery; Machine Learning; Oscillation; Seasonal Variation; Socioeconomics; Tropic Climate; Water Analysis; Water Availability; Water Dynamics; Water Supply; Agriculture; Chemistry; Environmental Monitoring; India; Procedures; Season; Water Conservation; Madhya Pradesh; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation Of Water Resources; Droughts; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Seasons; Water Resources; Water Supply","Climate change; Surface water resources; Water management; Agricultural practices; Global climate changes; Human activities; Human consumption; Semi arid; Surface water supply; Sustainable agricultural; Sustainable water management; Water dynamics; Waters resources; Surface waters; rain; ground water; agricultural practice; alternative agriculture; climate change; European Commission; human activity; Landsat; remote sensing; semiarid region; surface water; water footprint; water management; water resource; Article; drought; global climate; good agricultural practice; imagery; machine learning; oscillation; seasonal variation; socioeconomics; tropic climate; water analysis; water availability; water dynamics; water supply; agriculture; chemistry; environmental monitoring; India; procedures; season; water conservation; Madhya Pradesh; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation of Water Resources; Droughts; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Seasons; Water Resources; Water Supply","","","This work was supported by Ministry of Human Resource Development Government of India for providing the initiation grant (IISERB/R&D/2022\u201323/186) to Somil Swarnkar through Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal.","Groundwater in Arid and Semi Arid Areas Monitoring Assessment Modelling and Management, (2023); Akogul, Serkan, An approach for determining the number of clusters in a model-based cluster analysis, Entropy, 19, 9, (2017); J Cereal Res, (2022); Nakkala, Anusha Boya, Geospatial approaches for monitoring and mapping of water resources in semi-arid regions of Southern India, Environmental Challenges, 8, (2022); Water Qual Expo Health, (2013); Baker, Corey, Mapping wetlands and riparian areas using landsat ETM+ imagery and decision-tree-based models, Wetlands, 26, 2, pp. 465-474, (2006); Baker, Corey, Change detection of wetland ecosystems using Landsat imagery and change vector analysis, Wetlands, 27, 3, pp. 610-619, (2007); Bassi, Nitin, Status of wetlands in India: A review of extent, ecosystem benefits, threats and management strategies, Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, 2, pp. 1-19, (2014); Bezdek, Jim C., FCM: The fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, Computers and Geosciences, 10, 2-3, pp. 191-203, (1984); Bhaduri, Anik, Achieving sustainable development goals from a water perspective, Frontiers in Environmental Science, 4, OCT, (2016)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","15732959; 01676369","","EMASD","39162888","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201562931"

To that end, the distributed Integrated European Long-Term Ecosystem, critical zone and socio-ecological Research Infrastructure (eLTER RI) strives for an optimal observational design of its over 200 in-situ facilities. Their spatial distribution should be unbiased to scale local data to its continental target region. Therefore, we assessed biases in the emerging eLTER RI in-situ facility network. We (i) conducted a survey describing the emerging eLTER RI, (ii) detected critical gaps in its coverage of Reference Parameters by identifying biases in a six-dimensional thematic space and determined regions, where these biases cluster spatially, and (iii) derived recommendations to further develop the eLTER RI network. Three distinct gaps were identified: the Iberian, Eastern and Nordic Gap. They resulted mainly from underrepresentation of agricultural lands, mesic and dry regions with low economic density and the Mediterranean, Continental and Boreal biogeoregions. The patterns of underrepresentation are driven by various factors including the thematic context of site establishment over the past decades, operations logistics and funding constraints. We consider closing these gaps of highest priority for spatial network development. Mitigating the biases in the eLTER RI network is crucial to enable confident scaling of local data to the European scale. This will allow the eLTER RI to provide a comprehensive foundation for scientists, policy and decision makers to face global change. Next, a comprehensive dataset of possible additional research sites over Europe must be analysed to derive site- and country-specific recommendations for cost-efficient gap mitigation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Development; Long-term; Network; Observation; Representativity; Social-ecology","","","","Funding text 1: These biases must be mitigated or omitted to provide European ecosystem, critical zone and socio-ecological research with well-equipped in-situ facilities that represent major socio-ecological characteristics.

In this study, we compare temporal trends and variability in organic carbon content (OC), pH, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in 2009–2018 across the two datasets. The national monitoring programme encompasses more monitoring plots (620 vs. 134 in 2018), while LUCAS sampling is repeated more frequently and in addition to 2009 and 2018, it also includes data from 2015. The temporal variability in all examined indicators was substantially higher in the LUCAS dataset compared to the national monitoring data. In mineral soils, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between element contents measured in 2009 and 2018 ranged between 0.82 and 0.94 in the national dataset, and between 0.52 and 0.67 in the LUCAS dataset. The results for organic soils mirrored those of mineral soils. The higher variability in the LUCAS dataset may be attributed to less precise geolocation of sampling plots and/or variations in the sampling protocol such as greater sampling depth and the use of a spade instead of a core auger. The greater temporal variability, coupled with a smaller number of sampling plots in the LUCAS dataset, resulted in lower statistical power making the detection of trends with a realistic magnitude more challenging. Further, in LUCAS data, the confidence intervals of trends were of the same magnitude, regardless of whether the data from the year 2015 was included or not. The national dataset was found to be sufficient for detecting nationwide trends in element contents. Our results indicate that refining sampling protocols and improving the location accuracy of sampling plots are more cost-effective approaches to enhance the precision of temporal trend estimation than increasing the number of sampling plots. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Sampling Protocol; Soil Element Content; Soil Monitoring; Sources Of Uncertainty; Temporal Trend; Variability; Agricultural Soil; European Union; Organic Carbon; Soil Nutrient; Temporal Analysis; Temporal Variation; Finland","agricultural soil; European Union; organic carbon; soil nutrient; temporal analysis; temporal variation; Finland","","","We acknowledge the Joint Research Center for making European-wide LUCAS Soil data openly available.

However, a readily available pan-European crop phenology database covering key FOrum for the Co-ordination of pesticide fate models and their USe (FOCUS) crops and scenarios to meet this need is not currently available. Therefore, we describe the development of a harmonized, pan-European, CropLife Europe Crop Development Database (C2D2), that is fully aligned with this regulatory requirement utilizing efficacy trials data generated for regulatory submissions when registering plant protection products under Regulation (EU)1107/2009. Evaluation of C2D2 against an independent data set showed good agreement for equivalent time periods, crop growth stages, and geographical regions. We illustrate how this database can be used to evaluate existing default crop development dates mandated by regulatory agencies for use within exposure assessments. Despite the large data set compiled and the geographical coverage of C2D2, not all FOCUSsw/gw scenarios have sufficient data to facilitate comparison, with less significant scenarios, like FOCUSgw Porto, being underrepresented. For those scenarios with sufficient data, clear differences between C2D2 and crop development dates assumed in the FOCUS modeling framework (using the AppDate tool) are often indicated over many growth stages, suggesting that amendment of the existing representation of crop development within the risk assessment process may be required. C2D2 is freely available under a Creative Commons license to facilitate innovation in exposure science to allow for more accurate and realistic risk assessment leading to enhanced crop and environmental protection.

This study aimed to explore the influence of extreme climate conditions on soil pH and exchangeable aluminum, aiming to promote sustainable agricultural practices in Ethiopia. The Africa Soil Information Service (ASIS) provided datasets on soil pH and exchangeable aluminum. The European Copernicus Climate Change Data Store was used to download historical and future datasets of extreme climatic indices from 1980 to 2010 and 2015–2050, respectively. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model ensemble was used to predict future climate impacts under three shared socioeconomic scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.3, and SSP5-8.5. Data extraction, quality control, and clustering were conducted before analysis, and the model was validated for its accuracy and reliability in predicting soil parameter changes. An artificial neural network model was utilized to predict the effects of extreme climate indices on soil pH and exchangeable aluminum concentrations. The model was designed to accurately and reliably predict changes in soil parameters. This study compared the changes in soil pH and aluminum concentrations using paired t tests. The model's diagnostic results indicated a significant impact of extreme climate scenarios on soil pH and exchangeable aluminum. Extreme climate factors such as heavy precipitation and cooler night time temperatures significantly contribute to soil acidification and an increase in aluminum concentration. Under the SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 emission scenarios, soil pH levels are expected to increase by 8.38 % and 3.79 %, respectively. These changes in soil pH are expected to have significant impacts on the exchangeable aluminum content in the soil, with increases of 37 % and 5.38 %, respectively, under the same emission scenarios. However, the SSP5.8 scenario predicted a 45 % increase in exchangeable aluminum and a 9.36 % decrease in soil pH. Therefore, this study significantly enhances our understanding of the influence of climate change on soil health. The development of strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on agriculture in the region must consider the effects of extreme climate indices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abbay River Basin; Artificial Neural Network; Climate Factors; Model Validation; Soil Acidity","","","","The primary authors are grateful for the opportunity to conduct this research and for the assistance provided by Wollega University.

This article aims to construct a comprehensive convergent model for assessing the global and EU’s progress, degree of consolidation and symmetry of agricultural economies towards climate neutrality in the context of key international green initiatives. Methodology / approach. This research employs both qualitative and quantitative analyses to assess convergence measures in the agricultural sector’s carbon emissions. The quantitative component relies on the sigma and beta convergence models to evaluate international convergence in carbon emissions CO2 dynamics. The dimensions of modeling are as follows: global sample within 194 countries with reliable emissions data; European Union, focusing on convergence within the EU27 member states, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine. The time period covers open data from 1972–2022. The dynamics of sigma and beta convergence is determined for the points, namely UN Stockholm Conference (1972), UN Rio Conference (1992), Kyoto Protocol (entry into force in 2005), Paris Agreement (2015). Additionally, statistical indicators of variation, skewness, Gini and Theil indices were calculated for delineating global smoothness and the concentration of agricultural emissions. Results. The results of the study reveal an inertial and divergent trend of the agricultural economy towards decarbonisation, which slows down the overall movement towards “net zero” due to the presence of clubs of lagging agricultural countries that increase emissions in violation of international agreements. The reduction in emissions skewness in recent years shows that more countries are “pulling” decarbonisation due to their high capacity to move towards net zero, but this is not enough. The EU is the most prominent example of accelerated climate convergence, but markers of its weakening in recent years are identified due to the inability of economies to maintain the pace of decarbonisation caused by economic constraints, technological barriers, policy and regulatory issues, and misunderstandings of climate neutrality goals. It is shown that the long-term decarbonisation capacity of the agricultural sector is the key trigger for a country to make a positive contribution to the global convergence towards climate neutrality. At the current stage, the pace of decarbonisation plays a much greater role for consolidating efforts in the agricultural economy and achieving climate neutrality than the initial level of emissions in the sector. Factors in this process include proactive compliance with global climate agreements, technology sharing and cooperation, digitalisation and smart agriculture, and green financing and investment. Its implementation requires a three-way integration of stakeholder actions, strategy selection and results evaluation. Originality / scientific novelty. The study’s originality lies in its large-scale analysis of over 50 years of emissions dynamics and the context of five key green agreements that provided support for the green transition. It allows studying international convergence in agricultural sectors globally and within the EU. The novelty implies the integrated use of sigma and beta convergence models that identifies predictors of convergent and divergent processes and separates countries into leaders and laggards of agricultural decarbonisation. This approach provides a comprehensive view of modern climate policy, the impact of international green initiatives, and the position of individual towards climate neutrality in agriculture. Practical value / implications. The practical value lies in the ability to adjust climate policies for the agricultural economy’s decarbonisation, facilitating the determination of prospective outcomes for achieving climate neutrality. The aforementioned factors facilitate the process of governmental decision-making. The assessment of international programmatic agreements' effectiveness is enhanced through these models. The study offers a framework for global convergence towards climate neutrality in agriculture, highlighting the importance of digital technologies and smart agriculture as significant factors in global convergence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Decarbonisation; Agricultural Economics; Climate-neutral Economy; Convergence; Digitalisation","","","","","Emissions Gap Report 2023 Broken Record Temperatures Hit New Highs Yet World Fails to Cut Emissions Again, (2023); Anderson, Robyn, Climate change and the need for agricultural adaptation, Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 56, pp. 197-202, (2020); Leahy, Sinead C., Challenges and Prospects for Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Pathways Consistent With the Paris Agreement, Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, 4, (2020); Open Access Government, (2023); Tramel, Salena, Convergence as political strategy: social justice movements, natural resources and climate change, Third World Quarterly, 39, 7, pp. 1290-1307, (2018); Sun, Huaping, Estimating environmental efficiency and convergence: 1980 to 2016, Energy, 208, (2020); Goecke, Henry, Regional convergence in Europe, Intereconomics, 51, 3, pp. 165-171, (2016); Lyzun, Mariia, Architectonics of the European Currency Integration: Cluster and Gravity Modeling, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications, IDAACS, pp. 661-664, (2023); S., Economic Convergence and Real Dimensions: The Case of Shelter Deprivation, pp. 288-313, (2019); Marelli, Enrico, Economic convergence in the EU and Eurozone, Journal of Economic Studies, 46, 7, pp. 1332-1344, (2019)","","Institute of Eastern European Research and Consulting","","","","","","2414584X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201560031"

Remote sensing and machine learning techniques offer promising approaches for predicting SOC distribution. In this study, we used remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms to map SOC at regional to large scale, which we then combined with temporospatial and spectral signature-based soil sampling to integrate local ground measurements. A rigorous validation approach was performed where several independent unseen datasets with a high number of samples were used, which additionally involved densely sampled fields. We found that our approach could predict SOC with an average percentage error of less than 10 % with an R2 of 0.91 using support sampling on croplands located on mineral soils, demonstrating the potential of remote sensing, machine learning, and specific ground measurements for mapping SOC. Our results suggest that this approach could make small carbon differences measurable and inform carbon sequestration efforts and improve our understanding of the impacts of land use and field management practices on soil carbon cycling. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Machine Learning; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Soil Carbon Mapping; Soil Carbon Sequestration; Soil Health","","","","The authors would like to thank Rodrigo Principe, Witra Tahjudil, and Utku Berkalp Unalan for setting up the Google Earth Engine framework to download the satellite data and Rene Dechow for his help downloading model data for the OpenAgrar measurements and Trupthi Narayan and Peter Fröhlich for their valuable comments.

Research in recent decades has shown a progressive loss of blue carbon in mangrove forests as they are converted to aquaculture, agriculture, and urban development. We seek to study the relationship between human population density and soil carbon stocks in urban mangrove forests to quantify their role in the global carbon budget. To this end, we conducted a global analysis, collecting mangrove soil carbon data from previous studies and calculating population density for each study location utilizing a recent database from the European Commission. Results indicate population density has a negative association with mangrove soil carbon stocks. When human population density reaches 300 people km−2, which is defined as ‘urban domains’ in the European Commission database, mangrove soil carbon is estimated to be lower than isolated mangrove forests by 37%. Nonetheless, after accounting for climatic factors in the model, we see the negative relationship between population density and soil carbon is reduced and is even non-significant in mixed effects models. This suggests population density is not a good measure for the direct effects of humans on mangrove ecosystems and further implies mangrove ecosystems in close proximity to very high population density can still possess valuable carbon stocks. Our work provides a better understanding of how soil carbon stocks in existing mangrove forests correlate with different levels of population density, underscores the importance of protecting existing mangroves and especially those in areas with high human population density, and calls for further studies on the association between human activities and mangrove forest carbon stocks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon; Mangrove; Population Density; Soil; Urban; Budget Control; Ecosystems; Forestry; Population Distribution; Population Dynamics; Population Statistics; Soils; Urban Growth; Carbon Stocks; European Commission; Human Population; Mangrove; Mangrove Forest; Mangrove Soils; Population Densities; Soil Carbon; Soil Carbon Stock; Urban; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Mangrove; Population Density; Soil Carbon","Budget control; Ecosystems; Forestry; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Soils; Urban growth; Carbon stocks; European Commission; Human population; Mangrove; Mangrove forest; Mangrove soils; Population densities; Soil carbon; Soil carbon stock; Urban; Carbon; carbon sequestration; mangrove; population density; soil carbon","","","We acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation (DEB#2120677).

So far, studies mainly focus on the effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, surface water eutrophication or soil nutrient accumulation. Groundwater pollution of spring habitats, however, has received much less attention, although numerous papers report groundwater nutrient enrichment worldwide. This study presents a survey on groundwater pollution (with emphasis on nitrate and phosphate) and bryophyte composition in 51 ambient petrifying springs in 5 NW European countries, which were compared to published data from 173 other sites in 11 European countries. The reviewed dataset covers a broad range of unpolluted to heavily polluted springs with nitrate concentrations between 0.7 and 3227 μmol l−1. Most petrifying springs in the rural lowlands of NW Europe were found to have elevated concentrations of nitrate and phosphate with the most polluted springs occurring in The Netherlands. The cover of individual characteristic bryophyte species significantly correlates with groundwater nutrient concentrations indicating that nutrient pollution of spring waters affects bryophyte composition. Palustriella commutata, Eucladium verticillatum and Brachythecium rivulare prefer unpolluted petrifying springs whereas Cratoneuron filicinum and Pellia endiviifolia show a much broader tolerance to groundwater pollution. In order to sustain at least the basic conditions for the typical bryophyte composition of petrifying springs habitats, threshold values of 288 μmol (18 mg l−1) NO<inf>3</inf>− l−1 and 0.42 μmol (0.04 mg l−1) ortho-PO<inf>4</inf>3- l−1 were defined. Data analysis of the spring water composition indicates that the main source for nutrient and nutrient induced base cation enrichment are nitrate losses from intensively used agricultural fields. The anthropogenically induced but regionally different chemical processes in subsoil and aquifers can result in different levels of nutrient pollution in springs. Further regulations for nitrate and phosphate application are required to conserve and restore groundwater fed ecosystems in Europe. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ambient Springs; Base Cation Leaching; Eu-habitat Directive; Lycopodo-cratoneurion; Nutrient Threshold Values; Phosphate; Water; Nitrates; Phosphates; Water; Ground Water; Nitric Acid Derivative; Phosphate; Water; Bryopsida; Chemistry; Ecosystem; Human; Moss; Bryophyta; Ecosystem; Groundwater; Humans; Nitrates; Phosphates; Water","ground water; nitric acid derivative; phosphate; water; Bryopsida; chemistry; ecosystem; human; moss; Bryophyta; Ecosystem; Groundwater; Humans; Nitrates; Phosphates; Water","","phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; water, 7732-18-5; Nitrates; Phosphates; Water","Funding text 1: We acknowledge nature managers, landowners and local governments in different countries for their permission to sample petrifying springs and for providing relevant information about individual sites.

Cadmium inputs in the soil have increased significantly (+50 %) during the 20th century as a result of the application of fertilisers and sewage sludge, and also due to local contamination (e.g. waste dumping, mining) and industrial emissions (e.g. zinc smelters). Using the 21,682 soil samples from the LUCAS soil survey, we aim to estimate the spatial distribution of the concentration of Cd in the European Union (EU) and UK topsoil. Out of the total, 72.6 % of the samples have Cd values <0.07 mg kg−1, 21.6 % in the range 0.07–1 mg kg−1 and the remaining 5.5 % higher than the threshold of 1 mg kg−1, which is generally considered the limit for risk assessment. The mean Cd value in the EU topsoils is 0.20 mg kg−1, slightly higher in grasslands (0.24 mg kg−1) compared to croplands (0.17 mg kg−1). Applying an ensemble of machine learning models supported by a variety of environmental descriptors, we created maps of Cd distribution at a resolution of 100 m. The ensemble approach included five models and increased the prediction accuracy to R2 of 0.45 (an increase of 0.1 compared to best single model performance). The approach used resulted in a high predictive power for the general Cd distribution, while also identifying hotspots of Cd contamination. Natural factors influencing Cd levels include soil properties (pH, clay), topography, soil erosion, and leaching. As anthropogenic factors, we identified phosphorus inputs to agricultural lands as the most important for Cd levels. The application of the EU Fertiliser Directive should further limit Cd inputs and potentially the Cd content in soils. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cadmium; Fertilisers; Land Degradation; Lucas; Phosphorus; Soil Contamination; Cadmium; Phosphorus; Zinc; Cadmium; Fertilizers; Industrial Emissions; Risk Assessment; Sewage Sludge; Soil Pollution; Soil Surveys; Soils; Topography; 20th Century; Application Of Fertilizers; Cadmium Levels; European Union; Industrial Processs; Land Degradation; Lucas; Naturally Occurring; Soil Contamination; Topsoil; Phosphorus; Cadmium; Fertilizer; Phosphorus; Zinc; Database; European Union; Land Degradation; Soil Pollution; Topsoil; Article; Climate Change; Concentration (parameter); Cropland; Dumping; Environmental Factor; Environmental Policy; Grassland; Leaching; Limit Of Detection; Machine Learning; Mining; Prediction; Risk Assessment; Sewage; Soil Acidity; Soil Erosion; Surface Soil; Topography; Vegetation; Agricultural Land; Article; Clay; Controlled Study; Data Base; Degradation; Human Impact (environment); Ph; Smelter; Soil Property; Europe","Cadmium; Fertilizers; Industrial emissions; Risk assessment; Sewage sludge; Soil pollution; Soil surveys; Soils; Topography; 20th century; Application of fertilizers; Cadmium levels; European union; Industrial processs; Land degradation; LUCAS; Naturally occurring; Soil contamination; Topsoil; Phosphorus; cadmium; fertilizer; phosphorus; zinc; database; European Union; land degradation; soil pollution; topsoil; Article; climate change; concentration (parameter); cropland; dumping; environmental factor; environmental policy; grassland; leaching; limit of detection; machine learning; mining; prediction; risk assessment; sewage; soil acidity; soil erosion; surface soil; topography; vegetation; agricultural land; article; clay; controlled study; data base; degradation; human impact (environment); pH; smelter; soil property; Europe","","cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6","Thanks to Leonidas Liakos for his data and graphic support.

It provides a valuable decision-making tool for spatial planning and integrated development. SEEA implementation is a current key challenge for European Union (EU) Member States (MS), mainly due to high requirements on budget, technical capacity, and data, varying between countries. Within this frame, the objective of this paper is to demonstrate how the SEEA framework can be applied to analyse water ecosystems at river basin scale, building exclusively upon the officially registered, standardized national and EU datasets. We test how water resources can be accounted for using SEEA EA, with an additional component assessing water use based on SEEA Water. Within the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), two reporting cycles of river basin management plans have been completed for water ecosystems, providing spatial and temporal datasets. This material together with numerous data available at EU and national levels, water-relevant databases and repositories, resulting from MS reporting obligations, are tested and utilised for water accounting. The Alfeios river basin in Western Peloponnisos Greece serves as the case study area for compiling extent accounts, condition accounts, and supply and use accounts for provisioning water ecosystem services (drinking and irrigation water) for the periods 2009–2015 and 2015–2021 (the two WFD reporting cycles). It is demonstrated that readily available EU datasets can support the initial mapping and compiling of water ecosystem accounts at local scale, as applied in Greece, and therefore potentially also in other EU countries with fragmented data scattered in various administrative services and authorities with overlapping responsibilities on water resources. It is also concluded that future WFD reporting cycles and revisions of the river basin management plans could be better structured to enable a more direct connection of the collected data to ecosystem accounts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Natural Capital Accounting; Seea Ea; Seea Water; Sustainable Agricultural Development; Valuation; Water Ecosystem Services","","","","Funding text 1: The research and preparation of this paper was supported by the Mapping and Assessment for Integrated ecosystem Accounting (MAIA) project of EU call H2020-SC5-2018-1 [Grant Agreement Nr. 817527].; Funding text 2: The publication fees of this manuscript haνe been financed by the Research Council of the Uniνersity of Patras.","Bagstad, Kenneth J., Integrating physical and economic data into experimental water accounts for the United States: Lessons and opportunities, Ecosystem Services, 45, (2020); Bekri, Eleni S., The interplay between the alfeios (Greece) river basin components and the exerted environmental stresses: A critical review, Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 223, 7, pp. 3783-3806, (2012); Bekri, Eleni S., Optimizing water allocation under uncertain system conditions for water and agriculture future scenarios in alfeios river basin (Greece)-Part B: Fuzzy-boundary intervals combined with multi-stage stochastic programming model, Water (Switzerland), 7, 11, pp. 6427-6466, (2015); Bordt, Michael, Which ecosystems provide which services?

To deal with these challenges, countries are faced with the question of selecting the best tools among a large set of policy instruments. The problem of choosing the best policy instruments is aggravated by the very heterogeneous character of the societal demands that differ among member countries with very different economic and institutional structures. This study aims to introduce the agent-based modelling platforms that have been widely used in the impact analysis of recent rural development policies in the EU in a comparative manner. It also aims to explain how the above-mentioned sources of heterogeneity are handled in these models. To achieve the stated objectives, the study first examines the historical development of rural development policies within the EU. Subsequently, it proceeds to analyse several agent-based platforms that have been employed for the purpose of assessing the impact of agricultural policies with respect to certain features such as integration of land market, modelling unit, decision rule, rules of exit, labour market and price formation. To conclude, it is observed that as the rural development policies are formulated on farm-basis and as farms have a heterogeneous structure within themselves, in addition, the expansion of databases and the development of empirical analysis tools and technologies have led to a shift in empirical analyses towards agent-based models. However, these modelling platforms still embody various problems, especially in terms of database adjustments and parameterization and calibration of the model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agent-based Modelling; European Union; Rural Development Policies","","","","Economic, social, and environmental policies for rural development are under the purview of the CAP's so-called \""second pillar,\"" which was first outlined in 1988 as part of Agenda 2000.

It's designed to tackle numerous economic, social, and environmental problems plaguing the modern world. By providing a European \""menu of measures\"", it helps local, regional, and national authorities create their own multiannual rural development programmes.

They have the ability to assist livestock owners in animal surveillance, which is becoming more important due to the growing concerns of consumers and legislative modifications in European Union (EU) member states on animal welfare and housing. Besides promising existing approaches, there is a gap in transferability from standardized scientific research to broader real-world scenarios. This research investigates the frameworks Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5 in terms of their performances to detect the sow and their piglets in different farrowing pen environments and recording settings. The aim was therefore to investigate what kind of setup and data can be used to gain generalized object detection models that can be implemented in different environments. Across all possible training-test environment combinations, Faster R-CNN had a higher mean F1-Score (0.83) and Recall (0.89) than YOLOv5 (0.77, 0.64). In terms of Precision, YOLOv5 (0.97) performed better than Faster R-CNN (0.78). The evaluation of the data from different environments showed that a combination of different environments and recording settings in the training dataset is best suited for gaining generic models. Still, to optimize a model for a specific use case, fine-tuning a model with data from the environment it should be used in, is essential. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environment; Farrowing; Object Detection; Recording Settings; Invertebrates; Laws And Legislation; Mammals; Object Detection; Precision Agriculture; Video Analysis; Detection Framework; Environment; European Union; Farrowing; Object Detection Method; Objects Detection; Precision Livestock Farming; Recording Setting; State Of The Art; Video Image; Livestock","Invertebrates; Laws and legislation; Mammals; Object detection; Precision agriculture; Video analysis; Detection framework; Environment; European union; Farrowing; Object detection method; Objects detection; Precision livestock farming; Recording setting; State of the art; Video image; Livestock","","","","Alonso, M.

The aim is to create a single market for data, where data can flow within the EU and across sectors, for the benefit of all. Several authorities and approaches are in place for monitoring public and/or private agri-data and address the challenges of managing large-scale data infrastructures. However, what is missing is sufficient tools, models, and policies that would allow the seamless, transparent, and secure interoperation of existing agri-data infrastructures and platforms, which unfortunately remain isolated. While some attempts have been made to encourage interoperability, there are still major challenges to be addressed, both at technological and operational/business levels. On the technology side, one of the main barriers is due to the wide and heterogeneous landscape currently in place and the lack of dominant standardized solutions.

By analyzing agricultural holdings within the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), the study aims to focus the challenges and opportunities faced by farmers in a market-driven agricultural landscape. The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been instrumental in shaping the agriculture sector across member states. As the EU transitions towards a more market-oriented approach, agricultural holdings are required to adapt to changing market dynamics, technological advancements, and environmental sustainability. Hence these are the holdings which could deploy in practice the Agriculture 4.0 techniques. Through a comprehensive analysis of the FADN data, this article aims to identify the factors that contribute to the success or failure of market-oriented agricultural holdings in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian case study provides insights into the challenges faced by market-oriented agricultural holdings. The country's unique socio-economic characteristics, including a rural population and a history of agricultural production, make it an interesting case for analysis. The study examines key indicators such as farm size, land use, production diversity, and income levels within the FADN database. Furthermore, it explores the impact of EU policies, market integration, and access to financial resources on the development of these holdings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture 4.0; Bulgaria; European Union; Fadn; Commerce; Land Use; Sustainable Development; Agricultural Landscapes; Agricultural Sector; Agriculture 4.0; Agriculture Development; Bulgaria; Case-studies; Data Network; European Union; Farm Accountancy Data Network; Market Driven; Farms","Commerce; Land use; Sustainable development; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural sector; Agriculture 4.0; Agriculture development; Bulgaria; Case-studies; Data network; European union; Farm accountancy data network; Market driven; Farms","","","","Glossary Standard Output so Statistics Explained Europa Eu; Glossary Agricultural Holding Statistics Explained Europa Eu; Santos, Francisco J., Assessing the digital transformation in agri-food cooperatives and its determinants, Journal of Rural Studies, 105, (2024); Economic Regional and Social Challenges in the Transition Towards A Green Economy, (2021); Economic Thought Journal, (2022); Conference Proceedings of Knowledge Science Te Chnologies Innovations 2022; Socio Economic Analysez, (2023); Glossary Livestock Unit Lsu Statistics Explained Europa Eu; 23 Rsep Conference Proceedings 23rd Rsep International Economics Finance Business Conference, (2021); Socio Economic Analysez, (2023)","","Rezekne Higher Education Institution","","15th International Scientific and Practical Conference on Environment.

To fill this gap, we are developing the DIGIT4WATER project, with the main objective of generating ML models to predict degradation levels of various pollutants, many of which are of particular importance concerning current legislation. To this end, a large and comprehensive database is being generated, which includes AOPs and photo-chemical processes based on UV-C or direct solar radiation.

Given the unique financing characteristics inherent to agricultural enterprises and the substantial economic and historical distinctions between these regions, the exploration of financing strategies within this sector constitutes a crucial research task. The study incorporates financial data from agricultural firms operating in 12 European Union (EU) countries from 2000 to 2020, sourced from the BACH-ESD database. The primary analytical approach involves the application of panel data regressions, separately conducted for the two specified groups of 12 EU countries. The comparative analysis investigates the consistency of factors that affect the capital structure of agricultural firms between CEE and WE countries. The findings reveal that although there is no significant divergence in capital structure across countries, the influence of individual factors exhibits variability across the two macro-regions. The comparative analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers, financial institutions, and agricultural businesses in both groups of countries. Understanding the nuances of capital structure determinants specific to each region can aid in the development of more targeted and effective financing policies. Moreover, agricultural businesses should consider region-specific factors when making financial decisions. This research contributes to the existing literature by shedding light on the differences and similarities in the capital structure determinants of agricultural businesses in CEE and WE. It not only deepens our understanding of how financing strategies vary across regions but also highlights the importance of recognising the unique financial landscape of agricultural enterprises. By doing so, this study adds substantial value to the field of agricultural finance and provides grounds for more informed decision-making in the sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture Holdings; Farm Finance; Leverage; Pecking-order Theory; Trade-off Theory","","","","","Agricultural Finance Review, (1994); Bank for the Accounts of Companies Harmonized, (2023); Barry, Peter J., Financial structure of farm businesses under imperfect capital markets, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 82, 4, pp. 920-933, (2000); Benjamin, Catherine, Does capital market structure affect farm investment?

Universal Soil Loss Equations (USLE) and their modifications have been appreciated and commonly applied among many methods. The idea of this work is to use the ESDAC database (a web platform hosting a series of pan-European and global datasets on soil erosion) to build the modified form of the USLE for the Zagożdzonka catchment, a small agricultural area located in central Poland. The calculated sediment yield is compared with the one determined based on the reservoir survey. The conducted analyses show that the average annual suspended sediment yield from the study catchment estimated using the MUSLE equation accounts for 201 Mg and is close to that determined based on the reservoir survey, i.e., 248 Mg. However, MUSLE, with the initially proposed parameters, will overpredict sediment transport at the study site. The ESDAC database may support local studies concerning soil erosion and sediment transport.

At the same time, rock P is a critical raw material due to its importance for food production, the finite geological deposits, and its unequal regional distribution. As a consequence, nutrient management is addressed by numerous environmental policies. Process-based biogeochemical models are valuable instruments to monitor the P cycle and predict the effect of agricultural management policies. In this study, we upscale the calibrated DayCent model at European level using data-derived soil properties, advanced input data sets, and representative management practices. Our results depicted a P budget with an average P surplus (0.11 kg P ha−1 year−1), a total soil P (2240.0 kg P ha−1), and available P content (77.4 kg P ha−1) consistent with literature and national statistics. Through agricultural management scenarios, we revealed a range of potential changes in the P budget by 2030 and 2050, influenced by the interlink of P with biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles. Thus, we developed a powerful assessment tool capable of i) identifying areas with P surplus or deficit at high spatial resolution of 1 km2, (ii) pinpointing areas where a change in agricultural management would be most urgent to reach policy goals in terms of environmental pollution, food security and resource efficiency of a critical raw material, and iii) assessing the response of the P cycle to modifications in agricultural management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Environmental Policy; Nutrient Losses; Phosphorus Cycle; Process-based Biogeochemical Model; Scenario Analysis; Phosphorus; Agricultural Pollution; Biogeochemistry; Budget Control; Economics; Environmental Management; Food Supply; Nutrients; Soils; Agricultural Management; Biogeochemical Modelling; Critical Raw Materials; Environmental Policy; Nutrient Loss; P-cycles; Phosphorus Cycles; Process-based; Process-based Biogeochemical Model; Scenarios Analysis; Phosphorus; Phosphorus; Agricultural Management; Agricultural Soil; Biogeochemistry; Environmental Policy; Scenario Analysis; Soil Nutrient; Soil Property; Article; Biogeochemical Cycle; Calibration; Carbon Cycle; Controlled Study; Food Security; Leaching; Nitrogen Cycle; Phosphorus Cycle; Prediction; Soil; Europe","Agricultural pollution; Biogeochemistry; Budget control; Economics; Environmental management; Food supply; Nutrients; Soils; Agricultural management; Biogeochemical modelling; Critical raw materials; Environmental policy; Nutrient loss; P-cycles; Phosphorus cycles; Process-based; Process-based biogeochemical model; Scenarios analysis; Phosphorus; phosphorus; agricultural management; agricultural soil; biogeochemistry; environmental policy; scenario analysis; soil nutrient; soil property; Article; biogeochemical cycle; calibration; carbon cycle; controlled study; food security; leaching; nitrogen cycle; phosphorus cycle; prediction; soil; Europe","","phosphorus, 7723-14-0","Funding text 1: This research has received funding from the Mercator Research Program of the ETH Zurich World Food System Center (project “GOA”), as well as the European Commission Joint Research Centre under the Collaborative Doctoral Partnerships (CDP Agreement No. 35317).

Surprisingly, an overarching analysis of their ecological status and the stressors affecting them is yet missing. We compiled data on the ecological status of 1504 temporary rivers in seven European Mediterranean region countries and related their ecological status (1) to publicly available data on pressures from the European WISE-WFD dataset, and (2) to seven more specific stressors modelled on a sub-catchment scale. More than 50 % of the temporary water bodies in the Mediterranean countries reached good or even high ecological status. In general, status classes derived from phytobenthos and macrophyte assessment were higher than those derived from the assessment of benthic invertebrates or fish. Of the more generally defined pressures reported to the WISE-WFD database, the most relevant for temporary rivers were ‘diffuse agricultural’ and ‘point urban waste water’. Of the modelled more specific stressors, agricultural land use best explained overall ecological status, followed by total nitrogen load, and urban land use, while toxic substances, total phosphorus load and hydrological stressors were less relevant. However, stressors differed in relevance, with total nitrogen being most important for macrophytes, and agricultural land use for phytobenthos, benthic invertebrates and fish. For macrophytes, ecological quality increased with stressor intensity. The results underline the overarching effect of land use intensity for the ecological status of temporary water bodies. However, assessment results do not sufficiently reflect hydrological stress, most likely as the biological indicators used to evaluate these systems were designed for perennial water bodies and thus mainly target land use and nutrient impacts. We conclude that biomonitoring systems need to be updated or newly developed to better account for the specific situation of temporary water bodies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benthic Invertebrates; Fish; Intermittent Streams; Macrophytes; Phytobenthos; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Agriculture; Catchments; Ecology; Environmental Regulations; Fish; Land Use; Nitrogen; Water Conservation; Agricultural Land Use; Benthic Fish; Benthic Invertebrates; Ecological Status; Intermittent Streams; Macrophytes; Mediterranean Region; Phytobenthos; Water Framework Directives; Waterbodies; Rivers; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Benthic Environment; Biomonitoring; Fish; Macrophyte; Phytobenthos; Species Diversity; Species Richness; Agricultural Waste; Article; Benthos; Biological Monitoring; Controlled Study; Ecosystem; Environmental Impact; Environmental Stress; Human; Invertebrate; Land Use; Nonhuman; River; Southern Europe; Stream (river); Wastewater; Water Flow; Mediterranean Region","Agriculture; Catchments; Ecology; Environmental regulations; Fish; Land use; Nitrogen; Water conservation; Agricultural land use; Benthic fish; Benthic invertebrates; Ecological status; Intermittent streams; Macrophytes; Mediterranean region; Phytobenthos; Water Framework Directives; Waterbodies; Rivers; nitrogen; phosphorus; benthic environment; biomonitoring; fish; macrophyte; phytobenthos; species diversity; species richness; agricultural waste; Article; benthos; biological monitoring; controlled study; ecosystem; environmental impact; environmental stress; human; invertebrate; land use; nonhuman; river; Southern Europe; stream (river); wastewater; water flow; Mediterranean Region","","nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the EU PRIMA programme through the research project INWAT – Quality and management of intermittent river and groundwater in Mediterranean basins.

These two entities have parallel missions toward the conservation of cultivated PGRs and their CWR throughout France except for forest trees. One of these missions is to identify and to support both stakeholders involved in PGR conservation and in situ, ex situ and “on farm” PGR collections, in particular those meeting the criteria defined by the French government. Since 2019, seven curators have obtained this official recognition. Another mission is to identify the resources which have an importance for France especially resources of heritage value and for which there are a long-term conservation issue to include them into the National Collection and to make them available through the European database EURISCO. Activities of the national coordination are also carried out on identifying and safeguarding threatened collections and orphan species. An important progress on this aspect consisted in the creation since 2020 of three new public-private cooperation networks on bean, onion, and lettuce genetic resources. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","National Collection; Official Recognition; Plant Genetic Resources","","","","The authors thank the members of the PGR CTPS Section for their involvement in these activities and more broadly the stakeholders who are involved in the different working groups or cooperation networks.

However, the existing ready-to-use maps are characterized mainly by a coarse spatial resolution (>200 m) and information that is not up to date, making their use insufficient for the EU’s policy requirements, such as the common agricultural policy. This work, by utilizing the Soil Data Cube, which is a self-hosted custom tool, provides yearly estimations of soil thematic maps (e.g., exposed soil, soil organic carbon, clay content) covering all the agricultural area in Lithuania. The pipeline exploits various Earth observation data such as a time series of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (2018–2022), the LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Statistical Survey) topsoil database, the European Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) and artificial intelligence (AI) architectures to improve the prediction accuracy as well as the spatial resolution (10 m), enabling discrimination at the parcel level. Five different prediction models were tested with the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to achieve the best accuracy for both targeted indicators (SOC and clay) related to the R (Formula presented.) metric (0.51 for SOC and 0.57 for clay). The model predictions supported by the prediction uncertainties based on the PIR formula (average PIR 0.48 for SOC and 0.61 for clay) provide valuable information on the model’s interpretation and stability. The model application and the final predictions of the soil indicators were carried out based on national bare-soil-reflectance composite layers, generated by employing a pixel-based composite approach to the overlaid annual bare-soil maps and by using a combination of a series of vegetation indices such as NDVI, NBR2, and SCL. The findings of this work provide new insights for the generation of soil thematic maps on a large scale, leading to more efficient and sustainable soil management, supporting policymakers and the agri-food private sector. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Big Data; Copernicus; Digital Soil Mapping; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing; Soil Properties; Space-borne Data; Convolutional Neural Networks; E-learning; Food Supply; Forecasting; Forestry; Image Enhancement; Image Resolution; Land Use; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Mapping; Maps; Neural Network Models; Organic Carbon; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Soil Conservation; Soil Surveys; Soils; Space Optics; Copernicu; Data Cube; Digital Soil Mappings; Machine-learning; Remote-sensing; Soil Data; Soil Property; Space-borne; Space-borne Data; Thematic Maps; Big Data","Convolutional neural networks; E-learning; Food supply; Forecasting; Forestry; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Land use; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mapping; Maps; Neural network models; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soil conservation; Soil surveys; Soils; Space optics; Copernicu; Data cube; Digital soil mappings; Machine-learning; Remote-sensing; Soil data; Soil property; Space-borne; Space-borne data; Thematic maps; Big data","","","This work has been developed under the framework of the EIFFEL project (funded by European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 101003518).","Lehmann, Johannes C., The concept and future prospects of soil health, Nature Reviews Earth and Environment, 1, 10, pp. 544-553, (2020); Keesstra, Saskia D., The significance of soils and soil science towards realization of the United Nations sustainable development goals, SOIL, 2, 2, pp. 111-128, (2016); Rickson, Richmal Jane, Input constraints to food production: the impact of soil degradation, Food Security, 7, 2, pp. 351-364, (2015); Decäens, Thibaud, The values of soil animals for conservation biology, European Journal of Soil Biology, 42, SUPPL. 1, pp. S23-S38, (2006); Borrelli, Pasquale, Land use and climate change impacts on global soil erosion by water (2015-2070), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 117, 36, pp. 21994-22001, (2020); Panagos, Panos, Soil priorities in the European Union, Geoderma Regional, 29, (2022); Proposal for A Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience Ongoing Ordinary Legislative Procedure, (2023); Rinot, Oshri, Soil health assessment: A critical review of current methodologies and a proposed new approach, Science of the Total Environment, 648, pp. 1484-1491, (2019); Nunes, Márcio Renato, The soil health assessment protocol and evaluation applied to soil organic carbon, Soil Science Society of America Journal, 85, 4, pp. 1196-1213, (2021); Harris, Jim A.H., A new theory for soil health, European Journal of Soil Science, 73, 4, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20724292","9780891814184; 0891814183; 9780123694072","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177810135"

Allelic combinations of major loci sustained the bread-making quality while improving grain yield. Glu-D1, Pinb-D1, and non-gluten proteins are associated with sedimentation values and falling number in European wheat. Abstract: Zeleny sedimentation values (ZSV) and Hagberg-Perten falling number (HFN) are among the most important parameters that help determine the baking quality classes of wheat and, thus, influence the monetary benefits for growers. We used a published data set of 372 European wheat varieties evaluated in replicated field trials in multiple environments. ZSV and HFN traits hold a wide and significant genotypic variation and high broad-sense heritability. The genetic correlations revealed positive and significant associations of ZSV and HFN with each other, grain protein content (GPC) and grain hardness; however, they were all significantly negatively correlated with grain yield. Besides, GPC appeared to be the major predictor for ZSV and HFN. Our genome-wide association analyses based on high-quality SSR, SNP, and candidate gene markers revealed a strong quantitative genetic nature of ZSV and HFN by explaining their total genotypic variance as 41.49% and 38.06%, respectively. The association of known Glutenin (Glu-1) and Puroindoline (Pin-1) with ZSV provided positive analytic proof of our studies. We report novel candidate loci associated with globulins and albumins—the non-gluten monomeric proteins in wheat. In addition, predictive breeding analyses for ZSV and HFN suggest using genomic selection in the early stages of breeding programs with an average prediction accuracy of 81 and 59%, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Grain Proteins; Grain (agricultural Product); Proteins; Bread Making; D1 Protein; Data Set; Genetic Control; Gluten Protein; Grain Protein Contents; Grain Yield; Key Message; Wheat Varieties; Winter Wheat; Sedimentation; Plant Protein; Allele; Bread; Food Grain; Genetics; Genome-wide Association Study; Plant Breeding; Wheat; Alleles; Bread; Edible Grain; Genome-wide Association Study; Grain Proteins; Plant Breeding; Triticum","Grain (agricultural product); Proteins; Bread making; D1 protein; Data set; Genetic control; Gluten protein; Grain protein contents; Grain yield; Key message; Wheat varieties; Winter wheat; Sedimentation; plant protein; allele; bread; food grain; genetics; genome-wide association study; plant breeding; wheat; Alleles; Bread; Edible Grain; Genome-Wide Association Study; Grain Proteins; Plant Breeding; Triticum","","Grain Proteins","Funding text 1: The genotyping data were produced in the projects GABI-WHEAT funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF; project number 0315067).

This circumstance leads to the recurrent delivery of revised reanalysis databases that provide weather estimates for several decades back in time by combining the latest NWP models with observations. Since climate studies and agriculture water management applications require the availability of accurate and reliable weather data, assessing the performance of reanalysis products contributes to informed choices of potential weather proxy of ground-based agrometeorological data. CERRA (Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis) dataset is the latest regional reanalysis product released by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), in August 2022. CERRA is forced by the global ERA5 reanalysis, and it provides weather data with resolution of 5.5 km for the pan-European territory from 1984. For the first time in literature, this study explores the performance of CERRA data at 38 ground-based weather stations located in Sicily, an Italian region with Mediterranean climate, during the irrigation seasons 2003–2022. The objective of the study lies in evaluating CERRA performance with respect to air temperature, actual vapor pressure, wind speed and solar radiation that are input variables for assessing reference evapotranspiration, ET<inf>O</inf>, which is a key variable for quantifying irrigation volumes needed for water resources studies. The accuracy of ET<inf>O</inf> estimates depends on those input variables through the equation provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), i.e., the FAO Penman-Monteith equation. Here, it is also evaluated the performance of ET<inf>O</inf> estimates by using CERRA weather inputs in the FAO Penman-Monteith equation. The results show that the performances of CERRA weather data are excellent, especially for air temperature, and this determines that CERRA ET<inf>O</inf> estimates present high accuracy and reliability with a mean PBIAS and NRMSE equal to 5.6% and 13%, respectively, over the region. Those outcomes lead to the conclusion that CERRA dataset represents a valid alternative to ground-based agrometeorological measurements and their spatial interpolation for water resource regional studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Era5; Era5-land; Fao Penman-monteith Reference Evapotranspiration; Mediterranean Climate; Reanalysis Data; Weather Variables; Atmospheric Temperature; Climatology; Computing Power; Evapotranspiration; Numerical Models; Water Management; Water Supply; Weather Forecasting; Wind Speed; Era5; Era5-land; Fao Penman-monteith Reference Evapotranspiration; Mediterranean Climates; Penman Monteith; Performance; Reanalysis; Reanalysis Data; Reference Evapotranspiration; Weather Variable; Irrigation; Agrometeorology; Air Temperature; Data Assimilation; Data Set; Evapotranspiration; Food And Agricultural Organization; Forecasting Method; Solar Radiation; Weather Forecasting; Wind Velocity; Italy; Sicily","Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Computing power; Evapotranspiration; Numerical models; Water management; Water supply; Weather forecasting; Wind speed; ERA5; ERA5-land; FAO penman-monteith reference evapotranspiration; Mediterranean climates; Penman Monteith; Performance; Reanalysis; Reanalysis data; Reference evapotranspiration; Weather variable; Irrigation; agrometeorology; air temperature; data assimilation; data set; evapotranspiration; Food and Agricultural Organization; forecasting method; solar radiation; weather forecasting; wind velocity; Italy; Sicily","","","The paper contains modified Copernicus Climate Change Service information (Schimanke et al. 2021): the CERRA reanalysis data are Copernicus products belonging to European Union and accessible on the ECMWF Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS - https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).

The gridded datasets of India Meteorological Department (IMD) were used to statistically analyse the rainfall distribution, trend, coefficient of variation and intensity of rainfall. The gridded datasets of European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis V5 (ERA5) were examined for lower and upper tropospheric wind circulation (850 hPa and 200hpa), vertically integrated moisture transport (VIMT) and surface moisture flux (SMF). The datasets of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) were correlated with ISMR and composite deviation of rainfall and rainfall intensity during El Niño and La Niña from neutral years was examined at district level. Our analysis revealed that districts lying in eastern agroclimatic zone (EAZ) of Haryana received more ISMR during each month of monsoon season as compared to the ones situated in western agroclimatic zone (WAZ). Trend-free pre-whitening Mann–Kendall (TFPW-MK) test revealed that Kurukshetra, Panipat, Ambala, Rohtak, Faridabad, Jhajjar, Sonipat, Fatehabad and Palwal have shown a decreasing trend while Mahendragarh and Panchkula have shown an increasing trend of rainfall. During the El Niño years, most of the locations in the state received deficient to large deficient category, whereas during the La Niña episodes, most of the locations received excess to large excess category of ISMR, which is indicative of the influence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the regional scale. The influence of ISMR on bajra productivity for the districts lying in WAZ and rice productivity for the districts lying in EAZ was undertaken. This study is beneficial for understanding the impacts of climate change and climate variability on ISMR dynamics in Haryana which may further guide the policy-makers and beneficiaries for optimising the use of hydrological resources. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Enso; India; Rainfall; Spatial; Temporal; Trends; India; Sea; Season; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Weather; Oceans And Seas; Seasons; Spatio-temporal Analysis; Weather","India; sea; season; spatiotemporal analysis; weather; Oceans and Seas; Seasons; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Weather","","","","Abhilash, A., Climate-Smart Agriculture: An Integrated Approach for Attaining Agricultural Sustainability, pp. 141-189, (2021); Agilan, V., El Niño Southern Oscillation cycle indicator for modeling extreme rainfall intensity over India, Ecological Indicators, 84, pp. 450-458, (2018); Almazroui, Mansour, Trends of temperature extremes in Saudi Arabia, International Journal of Climatology, 34, 3, pp. 808-826, (2014); Almazroui, Mansour, Recent climate change in the Arabian Peninsula: Annual rainfall and temperature analysis of Saudi Arabia for 1978-2009, International Journal of Climatology, 32, 6, pp. 953-966, (2012); Angell, James K., Comparison of variations in atmospheric quantities with sea surface temperature variations in the equatorial eastern Pacific., Monthly Weather Review, 109, 2, pp. 230-243, (1981); Annamalai, Hariharasubramanian S., Global warming shifts the monsoon circulation, drying South Asia, Journal of Climate, 26, 9, pp. 2701-2718, (2013); Barnston, Anthony G., Documentation of a highly enso-related sst region in the equatorial pacific: Research note, Atmosphere - Ocean, 35, 3, pp. 367-383, (1997); Bhalme, H.

Six measures are used to reflect environmental innovation, including the percentage of enterprises that invest in environmental innovation, the percentage of enterprises implementing environmental innovation activities, the number of ISO 14001 certificates, patents related to environmental innovation, the total R&D personnel and researchers, and the amount of green early-stage investments. The estimation results show that EI positively impacts EP in 21 European countries using different econometric techniques during the 2011–2019 period. By using various econometric techniques (namely a panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) model, a feasible generalized least square estimates (FGLS) model, and the two-step general method of moment (the two-step GMM), our research demonstrates how environmental innovation impacts on environmental quality. The short- and long-term effects of autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) methods were also investigated using pooled mean groups (PMGs) to distinguish the short-run and long-run influences of EI. The relationship between EI and EP is explored by demonstrating how EI affects EP short- and long-term and comparing its influence on EP across many component measures of EI: air quality, sanitation, drinking water, heavy metals, waste management, biodiversity, habitat, ecosystem services, water resources, and agriculture. Notably, we find that the influences of EI become more pronounced in a country characterized by a well-developed institutional system.

However, the relatively coarse spatial resolution of SM products currently limit the application in water resource management at the field scale. In this study, we proposed a high-spatial-resolution SM retrieval framework based on the random forest algorithm (RF-SM) to integrate in situ SM dataset from in the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN), Landsat 8 optical and thermal observations, soil properties from SoilGrids V2.0, meteorological variables from the fifth generation of the European ReAnalysis (ERA5) dataset and four coarse-scale SM products including the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) and U.S. National Climate Assessment Land Data Assimilation System (NCA-LDAS). Compared to three other machine learning (ML) algorithms [extremely randomized trees (Extra-Trees), gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)], the random forest (RF) algorithm exhibited the best performance against a subset of 100 validation sites with a Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.69 and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.063 m3/m3. In terms of different land cover types and typical sites, RF-SM also showed a better accuracy than any of the individual SM product. Finally, the retrieval framework was applied to map the 30-m resolution SM spatial distributions in five substudy areas in the U.S. The results suggest that it is feasible to retrieve accurate SM at a 30-m spatial resolution from multiple satellite datasets based on the RF algorithm, which has important practical significance for agricultural drought monitoring at the field scale. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Drought; High Spatial Resolution; Machine Learning; Soil Moisture; Adaptive Boosting; Climate Change; Drought; Forestry; Image Resolution; Machine Learning; Mean Square Error; Water Management; Agricultural Drought; Field Scale; Gradient Boosting; High Spatial Resolution; Machine-learning; Multiple Satellites; Random Forest Algorithm; Random Forests; Retrieval Frameworks; Spatial Resolution; Soil Moisture; Data Set; Drought; Land Cover; Machine Learning; Satellite Data; Soil Moisture; Spatial Resolution; United States","Adaptive boosting; Climate change; Drought; Forestry; Image resolution; Machine learning; Mean square error; Water management; Agricultural drought; Field scale; Gradient boosting; High spatial resolution; Machine-learning; Multiple satellites; Random forest algorithm; Random forests; Retrieval frameworks; Spatial resolution; Soil moisture; data set; drought; land cover; machine learning; satellite data; soil moisture; spatial resolution; United States","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Natural Science Fund of China (No.42192581 and No. 42192580 and No. 42171310).

Knowledge about crop sequences used in organic and conventional farming will aid the development of future farming systems through optimising crop diversity and pre-crop effects for improved resource efficiency. This study aims to investigate crop diversity and patterns in organic and conventional crop sequences in Sweden. Large-scale LPIS field data managed by the European Union (EU) Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) were used to monitor crop sequences on arable land in Sweden over 10 consecutive years (2005–2014). Individual fields (land parcels) could be followed on 40% of Sweden's total arable area (349,891 fields extracted) over the 10 years. The LPIS data was combined with information from a database on which fields were farmed organically. Crop distribution, diversity of crop sequences and pre-crops to the main cereal crops (winter wheat, spring barley) were analysed in organic and conventional farming systems in the five agricultural productivity zones of Sweden. The results showed that in the most productive zone in southernmost Sweden, small-grain cereals (particularly winter wheat) were the most common crops (62%), followed by oilseeds (11%), ley and forage crops (9%) and sugar beet (8%), when excluding permanent grassland. In the least productive zone (at higher altitudes and/or latitudes), ley and forage crops dominated (67%), followed by spring cereals (barley, oats) (23%). Crop diversity was higher in the two more productive zones (mean 4.6 crop types) than in two less productive zones (3.4) and organic farms showed 9% higher crop diversity than conventional farms in the most productive zones. Overall, in all zones, the pre-crop to winter wheat was generally a different crop type (3 out of 5 times) e.g., young ley (1–2 years) or grain legume, while the pre-crop to spring barley was most often (4 out of 5 times) another cereal. For both these crops, pre-crop type was more diverse in organic than conventional systems. These findings demonstrate that LPIS data can offer valuable insights into agronomic trends and on-farm practices regarding crop choice and that analysis of field-level LPIS data on crop sequences at large scale can reveal information about organic and conventional cropping in different productivity zones across countries. This information can be used to understand the practical limitations in the use of crop diversity to maximise pre-crop effects. This could in turn support advisory service and policy makers to facilitate more sustainable, productive and resource efficient crop production. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arable Land-use; Crop Diversity; Crop Rotation; Organic Farming; Agronomy; Arable Land; Crop Production; Crop Rotation; Cropping Practice; Database; European Union; Identification Key; Land Use; Organic Farming; Sweden","agronomy; arable land; crop production; crop rotation; cropping practice; database; European Union; identification key; land use; organic farming; Sweden","","","Funding text 1: This work was part of the project ‘Constraints on the expansion of organic farming in Sweden’ led by Prof. Henrik G.

However, the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of available forecast products have hindered their widespread use in such modelling applications, which usually require high-resolution input data. In this study, we applied sub-seasonal (up to 4 months) and seasonal (7 months) weather forecasts from the latest European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) seasonal forecasting system (SEAS5) in a land surface modelling approach using the Community Land Model version 5.0 (CLM5). Simulations were conducted for 2017-2020 forced with sub-seasonal and seasonal weather forecasts over two different domains with contrasting climate and cropping conditions: The German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (DE-NRW) and the Australian state of Victoria (AUS-VIC). We found that, after pre-processing of the forecast products (i.e.Temporal downscaling of precipitation and incoming short-wave radiation), the simulations forced with seasonal and sub-seasonal forecasts were able to provide a model output that was very close to the reference simulation results forced by reanalysis data (the mean annual crop yield showed maximum differences of 0.28 and 0.36gha-1 for AUS-VIC and DE-NRW respectively). Differences between seasonal and sub-seasonal experiments were insignificant. The forecast experiments were able to satisfactorily capture recorded inter-Annual variations of crop yield. In addition, they also reproduced the generally higher inter-Annual differences in crop yield across the AUS-VIC domain (approximately 50g% inter-Annual differences in recorded yields and up to 17g% inter-Annual differences in simulated yields) compared to the DE-NRW domain (approximately 15g% inter-Annual differences in recorded yields and up to 5g% in simulated yields). The high-and low-yield seasons (2020 and 2018) among the 4 simulated years were clearly reproduced in the forecast simulation results. Furthermore, sub-seasonal and seasonal simulations reflected the early harvest in the drought year of 2018 in the DE-NRW domain. However, simulated inter-Annual yield variability was lower in all simulations compared to the official statistics. While general soil moisture trends, such as the European drought in 2018, were captured by the seasonal experiments, we found systematic overestimations and underestimations in both the forecast and reference simulations compared to the Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-3 soil moisture product (SMAP L3) and the Soil Moisture Climate Change Initiative Combined dataset from the European Space Agency (ESA CCI). These observed biases of soil moisture and the low inter-Annual differences in simulated crop yield indicate the need to improve the representation of these variables in CLM5 to increase the model sensitivity to drought stress and other crop stressors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crops; Surface Measurement; Water Resources; Weather Forecasting; Community Land Models; Crop Yield; Forecast Products; Forecasting System; Interannual; Land Surface Models; Modeling Approach; Ocean Surfaces; Seasonal Forecasting; Yield Prediction; Soil Moisture; Annual Variation; Crop Yield; Drought; Drought Stress; Land Surface; Seasonality; Simulation; Soil Moisture; Water Resource; Weather Forecasting; Australia; Germany; North Rhine-westphalia; Victoria [australia]","Crops; Surface measurement; Water resources; Weather forecasting; Community land models; Crop yield; Forecast products; Forecasting system; Interannual; Land surface models; Modeling approach; Ocean surfaces; Seasonal forecasting; Yield prediction; Soil moisture; annual variation; crop yield; drought; drought stress; land surface; seasonality; simulation; soil moisture; water resource; weather forecasting; Australia; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia; Victoria [Australia]","","","","Australian Crop Report Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, (2020); Ash, Andrew J., Constraints and opportunities in applying seasonal climate forecasts in agriculture, Australian Journal of Agricultural Research, 58, 10, pp. 952-965, (2007); Baatz, Roland, Evaluation of a cosmic-ray neutron sensor network for improved land surface model prediction, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 21, 5, pp. 2509-2530, (2017); Bauer, Peter, The quiet revolution of numerical weather prediction, Nature, 525, 7567, pp. 47-55, (2015); Journal of Open Source Software, (2020); Besondere Ernte Und Qualitatsermittlung Bee 2019 Agricultural Yield and Quality Assessment, (2020); Besondere Ernte Und Qualitatsermittlung Bee 2021 Agricultural Yield and Quality Assessment, (2022); Boas, Theresa, Improving the representation of cropland sites in the Community Land Model (CLM) version 5.0, Geoscientific Model Development, 14, 1, pp. 573-601, (2021); Bogena, Heye R., The TERENO-Rur hydrological observatory: A multiscale multi-compartment research platform for the advancement of hydrological science, Vadose Zone Journal, 17, 1, (2018); Bogena, Heye R., COSMOS-Europe: a European network of cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture sensors, Earth System Science Data, 14, 3, pp. 1125-1151, (2022)","","Copernicus Publications","","","","","","10275606; 16077938","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172871426"

Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of core vocabulary have produced conflicting results, with some supporting a farming expansion out of Anatolia ~9000 years before present (yr B.P.), while others support a spread with horse-based pastoralism out of the Pontic-Caspian Steppe ~6000 yr B.P. Here we present an extensive database of Indo-European core vocabulary that eliminates past inconsistencies in cognate coding. Ancestry-enabled phylogenetic analysis of this dataset indicates that few ancient languages are direct ancestors of modern clades and produces a root age of ~8120 yr B.P. for the family. Although this date is not consistent with the Steppe hypothesis, it does not rule out an initial homeland south of the Caucasus, with a subsequent branch northward onto the steppe and then across Europe. We reconcile this hybrid hypothesis with recently published ancient DNA evidence from the steppe and the northern Fertile Crescent. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Set; Database; Language; Numerical Model; Pastoralism; Sampling; Steppe; Article; Dna Determination; European; Evidence Based Practice; Genetic Analysis; Genetic Code; Geographic Distribution; Language Development; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Agricultural Worker; Agriculture; Animal; Bayes Theorem; Europe; Horse; Anatolia; Caucasus; Turkey; Agriculture; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Farms; Horses; Language; Phylogeny","data set; database; language; numerical model; pastoralism; sampling; steppe; Article; DNA determination; European; evidence based practice; genetic analysis; genetic code; geographic distribution; language development; nonhuman; phylogeny; agricultural worker; agriculture; animal; Bayes theorem; Europe; horse; Anatolia; Caucasus; Turkey; Agriculture; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Farms; Horses; Language; Phylogeny","","","This research was funded by the Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (Leipzig, Germany).

This is not only important on the national level but also beyond, including at the European level where use cases and consequently demand for pan-European data sets have evolved in recent years. In order to satisfy these needs, several initiatives regarding cadastral and other geospatial data have been launched in the last 20 years. It started with the Permanent Committee on Cadastre in the European Union, the European Land Information Service, INSPIRE, UN-GGIM Europe and recent European policies on open data and high-value datasets. Our main question is, did those initiatives result in the possibility of building a cadastral map of Europe or not? Is it possible to create a cadastral map of Europe on the desktop or an open online GIS application? Within the paper, we take the opportunity to reflect on the development and implementation of European spatial data infrastructure (INSPIRE) with the main focus on the availability and accessibility of cadastral data. We also take into consideration other European initiatives related to cadastral data. The overall findings show that there is still work to be carried out. Technological developments and recent policy initiatives will certainly be drivers for future improvement. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accessibility; Availability; Cadastral Data; Europe; Inspire; Accessibility; Cadastre; Data Set; Digital Map; Spatial Data; Technological Development; Europe","accessibility; cadastre; data set; digital map; spatial data; technological development; Europe","","","This research is supported by the scientific project Digital twins and smart cities from the University North, Croatia.","Guidelines for Integrated Planning for Sustainable Management of Land Resources, (1999); Land Administration Guidelines, (1996); Land Administration for Sustainable Development, (2010); Geographic Information Land Administration Domain Model Ladm, (2012); undefined; Lemmen, Christiaan H.J., The Land Administration Domain Model, Land Use Policy, 49, pp. 535-545, (2015); Paulsson, Jenny, The Land Administration Domain Model - A literature survey, Land Use Policy, 49, pp. 546-551, (2015); Kalogianni, Eftychia, Methodology for the development of LADM country profiles, Land Use Policy, 105, (2021); Polat, Zeynel Abidin, Global scientific production on LADM-based research: A bibliometric analysis from 2012 to 2020, Land Use Policy, 112, (2022); Van Oosterom, Peter J.M., The second themed article collection on the land administration domain model (LADM), Land Use Policy, 120, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","2073445X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166188814"

In the European Union (EU), large dischargers report releases of some chemicals, yet little is known of total emissions (point and diffuse) and their relative significance. We estimated copper loadings from all significant sources including industry, sewage treatment plants, surface runoff (from traffic, architecture, and atmospheric deposition), septic tanks, agriculture, mariculture, marine transport (antifoulant leaching), and natural processes. A combination of European datasets, literature, and industry data were used to generate export coefficients. These were then multiplied by activity rates to derive loads. A total of approximately 8 kt of copper per annum (ktpa) is estimated to enter freshwaters in the EU, and another 3.5 ktpa enters transitional and coastal waters. The main inputs to freshwater are natural processes (3.7 ktpa), agriculture (1.8 ktpa), and runoff (1.8 ktpa). Agricultural emissions are dominated by copper-based plant protection products and farmyard manure. Urban runoff is influenced by copper use in architecture and by vehicle brake linings. Antifoulant leaching from boats (3.2 ktpa) dominates saline water loads of copper. It is noteworthy that most of the emissions originate in a limited number of copper uses where environmental exposure and pathways exist, compared with the bulk of copper use within electrical and electronic equipment and infrastructure that has no environmental pathway during its use. A sensitivity analysis indicated significant uncertainty in data from abandoned mines and urban runoff load estimates. This study provided for the first time a methodology and comprehensive metal load apportionment to European aquatic systems, identifying data gaps and uncertainties, which may be refined over time. Source apportionments using this methodology can inform more cost-effective environmental risk assessment and management. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2023;19:1031–1047. © 2022 The Authors.

However, there is still a lack of high-quality, large-scale EO datasets for training robust networks. This paper presents AgriSen-COG, a large-scale benchmark dataset for crop type mapping based on Sentinel-2 data. AgriSen-COG deals with the challenges of remote sensing (RS) datasets. First, it includes data from five different European countries (Austria, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands), targeting the problem of domain adaptation. Second, it is multitemporal and multiyear (2019–2020), therefore enabling analysis based on the growth of crops in time and yearly variability. Third, AgriSen-COG includes an anomaly detection preprocessing step, which reduces the amount of mislabeled information. AgriSen-COG comprises 6,972,485 parcels, making it the most extensive available dataset for crop type mapping. It includes two types of data: pixel-level data and parcel aggregated information. By carrying this out, we target two computer vision (CV) problems: semantic segmentation and classification. To establish the validity of the proposed dataset, we conducted several experiments using state-of-the-art deep-learning models for temporal semantic segmentation with pixel-level data (U-Net and ConvStar networks) and time-series classification with parcel aggregated information (LSTM, Transformer, TempCNN networks). The most popular models (U-Net and LSTM) achieve the best performance in the Belgium region, with a weighted F1 score of 0.956 (U-Net) and 0.918 (LSTM).The proposed data are distributed as a cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG), together with a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC), which makes AgriSen-COG a findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) dataset. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Application; Benchmark Dataset; Common Agricultural Policy (cap); Crop Classification; Crop Detection; Crop Monitoring; Deep Learning; Image Segmentation; Multitemporal Analysis; Sentinel-2; Benchmarking; Classification (of Information); Large Dataset; Long Short-term Memory; Mapping; Pixels; Remote Sensing; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Benchmark Datasets; Common Agricultural Policy; Crop Classification; Crop Detection; Crop Monitoring; Deep Learning; Images Segmentations; Multi-temporal Analysis; Sentinel-2; Crops","Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Large dataset; Long short-term memory; Mapping; Pixels; Remote sensing; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Benchmark datasets; Common agricultural policy; Crop classification; Crop detection; Crop monitoring; Deep learning; Images segmentations; Multi-temporal analysis; Sentinel-2; Crops","","","This work was primarily funded by a grant from the Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS\u2014UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P4-ID-PCE-2016-0842, within PNCDI III, COCO (PN III-P4-ID-PCE-2020-0407) and the HARMONIA project, from the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under agreement No. 101003517.

In the European Union (EU), the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) is in place to provide information on risks in the food chain. The largest number of notifications in this system concerns plants, followed by products of animal origin and other products. The goal of the study was to examine RASFF notifications for products of plant origin with respect to hazard, year, product, notifying country, origin country, notification type, notification basis, distribution status and actions taken in 1998–2020. Data were extracted from the RASFF notifications’ pre-2021 public information database. A cluster analysis using joining and the two-way joining method was applied. The notifications mainly concerned aflatoxins in pistachios from Iran, ochratoxin A in raisins from Turkey, pesticide residues in peppers from Turkey, okra, curry, rice from India, tea from China and India, and pathogenic micro-organisms in sesame from India, and also basil, mint and betel from Thailand, Vietnam and Lao Republic. To ensure the safety of food of plant origin, it is necessary to adhere to good agricultural and manufacturing practices, involve producers in the control of farmers, ensure proper transport conditions (especially from Asian countries), ensure that legislative bodies set and update hazard limits, and ensure their subsequent control by the authorities of EU countries. Due to the broad period and scope of the studies that have been carried out and the significance of the European Union in the food chain, the research results can improve global sustainability efforts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cluster Analysis; Food Hazards; Food Safety; Plants; Rasff; Action Plan; Cluster Analysis; European Union; Food Chain; Food Safety; Manufacturing; Pathogen; Strategic Approach; Sustainability; Toxin; China; India; Iran; Thailand; Turkey; Viet Nam","action plan; cluster analysis; European Union; food chain; food safety; manufacturing; pathogen; strategic approach; sustainability; toxin; China; India; Iran; Thailand; Turkey; Viet Nam","","","The APC was funded by Gdynia Maritime University, Department of Quality Management, team research project “Systemic quality, environment and safety management in the product life cycle” number WZNJ/2023/PZ/04 and Cracow University of Economics, Department of Quality Management.","Econ Insights Trends Challs Ix, (2020); Annals Economy Series Constantin Brancusi University Targu Jiu, (2010); Vågsholm, I., Food Security, Safety, and Sustainability—Getting the Trade-Offs Right, Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, 4, (2020); Garcia, Sara N., One Health for Food Safety, Food Security, and Sustainable Food Production, Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, 4, (2020); Aiking, Harry, Food sustainability: Diverging interpretations, British Food Journal, 106, 5, pp. 359-365, (2004); Pozza, Liana E., The science of Soil Security and Food Security, Soil Security, 1, (2020); Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems Safa, (2013); undefined; Regulation EC 178 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 Laying Down the General Principles and Requirements of Food Law Establishing the European Food Safety Authority and Laying Down Procedures in Matters of Food Safety; undefined","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160740799"

Both multivariate and non-parametric convergence analyses were employed, using 27 indicators extrapolated from the FAO dataset. The results provide a reasonable assessment of the differences between countries in relation to their farming production methods and show that the levels of convergence/divergence depend on changes in agricultural activities over the past decade. Indeed, differences in land use, the application of organic fertilizers and pesticides, the raising of livestock, and GHG emissions allow “homogenous” groups of Member States with common features to be identified. It is important to understand the dynamics of different agriculture systems and production activities because, beneath management practices, there may be differences between systems.

There is an urgent need to identify sustainable livestock systems that are environmentally friendly, economically viable for farmers, and socially acceptable. To this end, diversity assessments and data-driven indicator-based sustainability assessments can be helpful tools. These two mutually reinforcing approaches each have their own dilemmas and strengths; however, their combination is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a method that simultaneously assesses the diversity and sustainability of production systems within one agricultural sector, without compromising either aspect, while overcoming the dilemmas of diversity and sustainability assessments. We test our method on the Walloon dairy and beef sectors (Belgium) and base our assessment on data from the European Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). We apply relevant classification criteria to the sample farms to group them into production systems. The core data was complemented with calculated environmental indicators to perform a comprehensive sustainability assessment, including structural, socio-economic, and environmental indicators. Our results confirm the importance of complementing sustainability assessments with diversity assessments. Our case study results show that a diversity of livestock systems coexist and that it is possible to overcome trade-offs between economic and environmental performances. Extensive grass-based systems present the best combination of economic and environmental results, which highlights the importance of preserving grassland resources at the regional level. The proposed method proves effective to improve the relevance of FADN data and supports the ongoing call to transform the FADN into a more comprehensive database that satisfactorily covers all dimensions of sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diversity Assessments; Farm Accountancy Data Network (fadn); Indicator-based Sustainability Assessments; Livestock Systems; Multidimensional Sustainability; Production Systems; Database; Grassland; Livestock Farming; Production System; Sustainability; Belgium","database; grassland; livestock farming; production system; sustainability; Belgium","","","We thank the DAEA for providing us with the farm accountancy data.

The present study aims to estimate how the climate change can influence land degradation in the south areas of Baghdad province (Al-Rasheed, Al-Mahmudiyah, Al-Yusufiyah, Al- Madaen, and Al-Latifiyah). The Satellite Landsat-8 OLI and satellite Landsat-5 TM sensor imagery were used to extent land degradation for the period (2010-2019). ArcGIS V.10.4 was applied to manage and analysis the satellite image dataset, including the use of climate factors data from the European Center for Climate Forecasts (ECMWF) by reanalyzes and extraction datasets. To achieve work objectives, many ground data were collected, including the temperature, rain precipitation, evaporation, and relative humidity from 30 meteorological monitoring stations. These data help us to utilize the interpolation methods for the extraction process of contour lines maps, to be scientific indicators of the relationship between climatic factors and satellite images classifications, involving the spectral indicators of the vegetation cover and water bodies. The results showed the agriculture degradation through the decreasing of vegetation cover rate from 56.57% in (2010) to 43.43% in )2019 (.

Data produced by Earth Observation satellites is crucial to track climate change, improve agriculture, weather forecasting and disaster management. However, the currently available space-based sensors do not provide the required temporal resolution to achieve advanced monitoring system at a national and regional scale. To address this issue, EnduroSat is launching a cutting-edge Earth Observation data delivery service - the BALKAN constellation. The constellation will consist of multispectral and hyperspectral sensors hosted on EnduroSat's small satellite platforms. The BALKAN constellation will start with a pilot phase of two satellites, with the first satellite to be launched in 2024. This constellation has been selected as one of the Copernicus Contributing Missions by the European Union and ESA. In a second step, EnduroSat is going to expand the constellation by adding more satellites and sensors in orbit. The plan is to deploy a total of 120 satellites with multispectral and hyperspectral imagers between 2024 and 2028. The core innovation of the spacecraft is that they are software-defined, plug-and-play platforms, capable of in-orbit configurations and updates. The cutting-edge multispectral cameras can provide a native GSD of 1.5 m in 7 bands which allows interoperability with Sentinel-2 data. The powerful on-board processing device allows execution of complex AI algorithms, enabling automatic detection and download of data based on pattern recognition. It will allow customers to deploy apps running directly on the satellite, monitoring unprecedented surfaces from space. The mission is intended as a show case of continuous real-time processing on high-resolution optical data. The processing will rely on image equalization on board and simplified Deep Neural Networks. The innovative concept for a software-defined platform with exceptional resolution, on-board processing and data relay message transmission capabilities would enable unprecedented European data intelligence service. The BALKAN constellation will provide incomparable revisit time and scalability, as well as unmatched operational flexibility, facilitated by the short time to launch and streamlined in-house satellite development. A constellation of 120 satellites will bring revisit times from once a week to several minutes, complementing large satellites' data and substantially reducing spatial and temporal aliasing in prediction models. The BALKAN constellation has the potential to provide up to 20-30% overall increase of Earth Observation data and complement the Copernicus database with unrivalled local information and temporal resolution.

The use of Big Data in farming requires the collection and analysis of data from various sources such as sensors, satellites, and farmer surveys. While Big Data can provide the farming community with valuable insights and improve efficiency, there is significant concern regarding the security of this data as well as the privacy of the participants. Privacy regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU Code of Conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement, and the proposed EU AI law, have been created to address the issue of data privacy and provide specific guidelines on when and how data can be shared between organizations. To make confidential agricultural data widely available for Big Data analysis without violating the privacy of the data subjects, we consider privacy-preserving methods of data sharing in agriculture. Synthetic data that retains the statistical properties of the original data but does not include actual individuals' information provides a suitable alternative to sharing sensitive datasets. Deep learning-based synthetic data generation has been proposed for privacy-preserving data sharing. However, there is a lack of compliance with documented data privacy policies in such privacy-preserving efforts. In this study, we propose a novel framework for enforcing privacy policy rules in privacy-preserving data generation algorithms. We explore several available agricultural codes of conduct, extract knowledge related to the privacy constraints in data, and use the extracted knowledge to define privacy bounds in a privacy-preserving generative model. We use our framework to generate synthetic agricultural data and present experimental results that demonstrate the utility of the synthetic dataset in downstream tasks. We also show that our framework can evade potential threats, such as re-identification and linkage issues, and secure data based on applicable regulatory policy rules. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big Data In Agriculture; Data Privacy; Privacy Attacks; Privacy Policy; Codes (symbols); Deep Learning; Farms; Laws And Legislation; Privacy-preserving Techniques; Sensitive Data; Big Data In Agriculture; Code Of Conduct; Confidential Data; Data Sharing; Farming Communities; Policy Rules; Privacy Attacks; Privacy Policies; Privacy Preserving; Secure Data; Data Mining","Codes (symbols); Deep learning; Farms; Laws and legislation; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Big data in agriculture; Code of conduct; Confidential data; Data Sharing; Farming communities; Policy rules; Privacy Attacks; Privacy policies; Privacy preserving; Secure data; Data mining","","","","How to Feed the World in 2050, (2009); Regulation Eu 2016 679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the Protection of Natural Persons with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data and Repealing Directive 95 46 EC General Data Protection Regulation; Eu Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement, (2018); Laying Down Harmonised Rules on Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence Act and Amending Certain Union Legislative Acts, (2021); Torkzadehmahani, Reihaneh, DP-CGAN: Differentially private synthetic data and label generation, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2019-June, pp. 98-104, (2019); Dp Gan Diversity Promoting Generative Adversarial Network for Generating Informative and Diversified Text, (2018); International Conference on Learning Representations, (2018); Kotal, Anantaa, PriveTAB : Secure and Privacy-Preserving sharing of Tabular Data, pp. 35-45, (2022); Ceja Two New Partners Sign Up to the Eu Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing; Dwork, Cynthia, Calibrating noise to sensitivity in private data analysis, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3876 LNCS, pp. 265-284, (2006)","He, J.; Palpanas, T.; Hu, X.; Cuzzocrea, A.; Dou, D.; Slezak, D.; Wang, W.; Gruca, A.; Lin, J.C.-W.; Agrawal, R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Ankura; IEEE Dataport","2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, BigData 2023","","Sorrento","196820","","9798350324457","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184985083"

Researchers are actively publishing their findings related to emissions of pollutants and harmful gases (e.g., greenhouse gases), odors, bioaerosols, and dust. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the topics of interest and the collaborative networks to advance the development of research. The purpose of the present review is to identify the evolution and global research trends about air contaminant emissions specifically from the agricultural sector. This study uses three approaches to identify global trends related to air contaminant emissions specifically from agricultural activities 1. A bibliometric analysis highlights significant trends of research over time. Aspects such as temporal and spatial distributions, most productive countries, authors, and funding institutions are sorted out to assess the influence of research. 2. A social network analysis evaluates the relationship among journals and keywords, identifying the hotspots. 3. A patent analysis tracks the progress of emerging technologies, innovations, and new development research. The publications and patents were collected from Web of Science (WoS) database and Espacenet database (European patent office), respectively, with a span range from 1990 to 2022. This study compiled 3159 scientific papers and 1061 patents. Three periods of time were explored to analyze the evolution of research about air emissions from the agricultural sector. The trend of scientific publications regarding this topic concerns 108 countries, with at least one publication about the subject. The trend is also increasing in recent years as a topic widely studied in many fields such as environmental science, science & technology, energy fuels, and public environmental & occupational health. Moreover, results from the bibliometric analysis show that about 9800 researchers and 800 journals published in this field in the last decade. Patent data revealed a large number of filed patents, which is indicative of the industrial interest and innovation in air quality from the agricultural sector. These findings underscore the evolution of the research on air contaminants emissions from the agricultural sector and identifies the main topics of interest. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerosols; Agriculture; Air Contaminants; Bibliometric; Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Network; Patents; Agriculture; Air Quality; Climate Change; Contamination; Environmental Technology; Greenhouse Gases; Industrial Emissions; Patents And Inventions; Publishing; Agricultural Activities; Agricultural Sector; Air Contaminant Emissions; Air Contaminants; Bibliometric; Emission; Global Trends; Greenhouses Gas; Network; Patent; Aerosols","Agriculture; Air quality; Climate change; Contamination; Environmental technology; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Patents and inventions; Publishing; Agricultural activities; Agricultural sector; Air contaminant emissions; Air contaminants; Bibliometric; Emission; Global trends; Greenhouses gas; Network; Patent; Aerosols","","","The authors wish to acknowledge the support of NSERC through the Frontiers Grant (Grant No. 539024-2019), Agrivita Canada Inc and MAPAQ (Grant IA119531).","Thiel, Nadine, Airborne bacterial emission fluxes from manure-fertilized agricultural soil, Microbial Biotechnology, 13, 5, pp. 1631-1647, (2020); Bakayoko, Adama, Dominant contribution of nitrogen compounds in precipitation chemistry in the Lake Victoria catchment (East Africa), Environmental Research Letters, 16, 4, (2021); Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, (2022); Sources Et Puits De Gaz A Effet De Serre Au Canada Sommaire 2022 Canada Ca; Pathak, Himanshu K., Greenhouse gas emission from Indian agriculture: Trends, drivers and mitigation strategies, Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy, 81, 5, pp. 1133-1149, (2015); Analyse Du Cycle De Vie De La Gestion Des Fumiers En Production D Ufs De Consommation, (2006); Woodbury, Bryan L., EMISSION OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS FROM LAND-APPLIED BEEF CATTLE MANURE AS AFFECTED BY APPLICATION METHOD, DIET, AND SOIL WATER CONDITION, Journal of the ASABE, 65, 1, pp. 123-133, (2022); Sommer, Svend Gjedde, Ammonia Emission from Mineral Fertilizers and Fertilized Crops, Advances in Agronomy, 82, pp. 557-622, (2001); Fournel, Sébastien, Optimal housing and manure management strategies to favor productive and environment-friendly dairy farms in Québec, Canada: Part II.

The satellite image acquisition technology allows to access databases of satellite maps with different spectral indices. Some of these, based on spectrum bands with wavelengths in the near and far infrared zone, are dedicated to the surface water content of crops or soils. The purpose of the study was to compare durum wheat yield in conservative agricultural practices compared to conventional one in a Mediterranean climate conditions, by analysing data collected from the Sentinel2 satellite; to study the effects of automatic driving versus manual one on crop production and on the spectral indices NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) and NMDI (Normalized Multi-band Drought Index); and to find a correlation between the indices considered and the yields of the current crop. The results indicated the possibility of the spectral indices to understand the effect of the tillage practices on soil moisture. The use of these indices - available free of charge from ESA (European Space Agency) dataset - allows to have a high-frequency information tool for evaluating the effect of agricultural practices, dynamics of crops and characteristics of the soil; moreover, it could provide a greater awareness on the application of management choices dedicated to sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ndvi; Ndwi; Nmdi; No Tillage; Precision Agriculture; Satellites Image; Agricultural Technology; Cultivation; Precision Agriculture; Satellites; Soil Moisture; Surface Waters; Technology Transfer; Agricultural Practices; Crop Managements; Multi Band; No Tillage; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Normalized Difference Water Index; Normalized Multi-band Drought Index; Precision Agriculture; Satellite Images; Spectral Indices; Crops","Agricultural technology; Cultivation; Precision agriculture; Satellites; Soil moisture; Surface waters; Technology transfer; Agricultural practices; Crop managements; Multi band; No tillage; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized difference water index; Normalized multi-band drought index; Precision Agriculture; Satellite images; Spectral indices; Crops","","","Acknolegdements This study was supported by the Italian P.O.N. “RICERCA E INNOVAZIONE” 2014 – 2020, Azione II – Obiettivo Specifico 1b – Progetto “Miglioramento delle produzioni agroalimentari mediterranee in condizioni di carenza di risorse idriche–WATER4AGRIFOOD”.

It is, therefore, important to forecast soil moisture to inform expectations of derivative outputs reliably. While forecasting soil moisture continues to advance, there is a need to extend it to different geoclimatic regions, including in sub-Saharan Africa, where livelihoods predominantly rely on subsistence agriculture. We used remotely sensed soil moisture data produced by the European Space Agency–Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI). The data, which covered the period 1978 to 2019, were used to forecast monthly soil moisture in different agroecological zones and land cover types. The Seasonal Random Walk, Exponential Smoothing and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) forecasting models were trained on 70% of the data (November 1978–August 2007) and subsequently applied to a test dataset (September 2007–December 2019). All models showed solid prediction accuracies for all agroecological zones (unbiased root mean square error, ubRMSE ≤ 0.05 m3 m−3) and land cover types (ubRMSE ≤ 0.04 m3 m−3). This was corroborated by similarities in season-adjusted anomalies between observed and forecasted soil moisture for nearly all agroecological zones and land cover types, with a correlation coefficient of r > 0.5 for most locations).

This study generates a set of integrated reconstruction methods based on multisource data and produces a new set of improved historical cropland data sets in Europe over the past 200 years. For AD 2000, FAO data, existing research results and statistical data are integrated. For AD 1900, a method of integrating two sets of independent historical agricultural land data by correction and validation and supplemented by other historical cropland data are developed. For AD 1850 and 1800, a methodological scheme of diversified proxy integrative technology and methods based on multisource data is constructed. In this new data set, quantitative reconstructions for AD 1900, 1850 and 1800 are improved to account for 100, 78 and 57% of all European countries, respectively. The reconstruction results show that each region in Europe has been in different stage of historical agricultural development. More than 86% of the countries’ cropland area and its proportion peaked in AD 1900 or did not exceed the data for AD 2000. Specifically, a high reclamation zone gradually formed from France to Ukraine, in which every country’s cropland fraction was ≥40% during AD 1800–1900. From AD 1900–2000, the highly cultivated region contracted, and the centre of higher cropland proportions shifted to eastern Europe and Poland, Czechia and Hungary. The cropland area was systematically underestimated by HYDE3.2, with a relative difference ratio of −20 to −30% between HYDE3.2 and this study. Historical empirical data were used for only 32% of countries in HYDE3.2. This method of multiproxy integrated reconstruction is applicable to other regions of the world and it would be worth attempting to apply it to earlier historical European cropland data sets in the future. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Development; Agricultural Land; Data Set; Empirical Analysis; Historical Perspective; Holocene; Land Cover; Land Reclamation; Land Use Change; Europe","agricultural development; agricultural land; data set; empirical analysis; historical perspective; Holocene; land cover; land reclamation; land use change; Europe","","","We thank an anonymous reviewer and the editor (Jan A.

Reanalysis precipitation datasets (RPDs) are attractive alternatives for monitoring the hydro-climate cycles. However, their applicability in China has mainly been evaluated at the national scale, while less attention has been paid to the PLB or southeastern China. Here, we apply various metrics to evaluate the magnitude and spatial similarity of annual, monthly, different intensities and the spatial structure of precipitation from four reanalysis—the fifth global atmospheric analysis dataset of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (ERA5), Interim ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), Japanese 55-year Reanalysis project (JRA55) and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), against the rain-gauges over the PLB during 1980–2018. The results showed that the detection capacity of ERA5 and MERRA2 shifted around 2002, whereas that of ERA-Interim and JRA55 did not substantially change. Before 2002, ERA-Interim had the lowest biases for the magnitude of annual, monthly and different intensities of precipitation (except for heavy rain), while ERA5 and MERRA2 had strengths in capturing spatial correlation. Notably, ERA5 and MERRA2 had region-wide wet and dry biases, respectively, before 2002, which can be attributed mainly to the estimation of flood season precipitation (from April to June) and heavy rain. In contrast, the fractional contribution of light–moderate rain was underestimated and overestimated by ERA5 and MERRA2, respectively. However, after 2002, because of the improved reproducibility of flood season precipitation and heavy rain magnitude, the systematic biases of ERA5 and MERRA2 significantly decreased, especially for ERA5, which outperformed other RPDs on all aspects of precipitation. The conclusions of this paper suggest that the variation of applicability over time should be seriously tested before the utilization of RPDs in hydro-climate analyses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Evaluation; Poyang Lake Basin; Precipitation; Reanalysis Datasets; Agriculture; Climate Change; Ecosystems; Flood Control; Floods; Lakes; Rain Gages; Weather Forecasting; Ecosystem Services; European Center For Medium-range Weather Forecasts; Evaluation; Flood Season; Heavy Rains; Poyang Lake Basins; Reanalysis; Reanalysis Dataset; Season Precipitation; Uncertainty; Rain; Climate Cycle; Data Set; Hydrometeorology; Precipitation Intensity; Spatial Analysis; Weather Forecasting; China; Jiangxi; Poyang Basin","Agriculture; Climate change; Ecosystems; Flood control; Floods; Lakes; Rain gages; Weather forecasting; Ecosystem services; European center for medium-range weather forecasts; Evaluation; Flood season; Heavy rains; Poyang Lake basins; Reanalysis; Reanalysis dataset; Season precipitation; Uncertainty; Rain; climate cycle; data set; hydrometeorology; precipitation intensity; spatial analysis; weather forecasting; China; Jiangxi; Poyang Basin","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Meteorological Science and Technology Project of Jiangxi Province (20190108).

This requires decision-making processes depending on data on the P status of agricultural fields, commonly conducted with soil P tests (SPTs), and efficient use of the resource on a societal scale following a circular economy approach. All this will decrease the P losses and the subsequent environmental impact. However, SPTs are not universal and, even for a given SPT, the definition of threshold values for fertilizer response is not accurate. This work aimed to define models to predict Olsen P threshold values, allowing the identification of P-responsive sites at the European scale as a basis for more accurate and sustainable P fertilization schemes based on a circular economy approach. To this end, a data set was compiled based on a literature review that describes the Olsen P threshold values for different crops under field conditions. Subsequently, an analysis of potential P fertilizer requirements was performed on agricultural soils of the European Union (EU) using the data set of the LUCAS project and how this need can be covered with a circular economy approach. Environmental factors were more relevant than crops to explain the variation in threshold values. A regression model involving soil pH and clay content and annual average rainfall as independent variables explained 61% of the variance in Olsen P threshold values. When soil pH and clay content were the only explanatory variables, the explained variance was 49%. This reveals the need to take into account factors related to P buffer and sorption capacity to estimate accurate threshold values. We detected that only 27.8% of EU cropland soils and 42.7% of grassland soils were P-responsive. We can conclude that a more precise allocation of the resource is possible in P-responsive sites and also that most of the European demand for P could be covered by recycling P from manure, wastewater, and municipal solid waste. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Circular Economy; Fertilizer; Soil P Test; Threshold Value; Crops; Decision Making; Fertilizers; Municipal Solid Waste; Phosphorus; Regression Analysis; Sustainable Development; Agricultural Soils; Circular Economy; Clay Content; Data Set; Decision-making Process; European Union; Soil Clay; Soil P Test; Soil Ph; Threshold-value; Soils","Crops; Decision making; Fertilizers; Municipal solid waste; Phosphorus; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Agricultural soils; Circular economy; Clay content; Data set; Decision-making process; European union; Soil clay; Soil P test; Soil pH; Threshold-value; Soils","","","Funding text 1: This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 818309 (LEX4BIO).

Consequently, researchers are increasingly relying on remote sensing techniques to overcome this challenge. However, remote assessments of human pressure on biodiversity may miss crucial threats, such as hunting and invasive species, which are often best documented through in situ field surveys. Here, we use a unique European Union dataset documenting human threats within 8210 PAs through field surveys to assess the relationship between those threats and three commonly used indices of human pressure that are largely derived using remote-sensing methods—the Human Footprint and Human Modification indices and the LandScan Global Population Database. We find that the indices are not always related to the threats recorded within PAs through field surveys. The indices seem to best capture threats associated with urbanization, agriculture, and pollution but not necessarily others. Although remote assessments of human pressure on biodiversity are crucial for conservation, researchers and practitioners must be aware of their limitations and must complement such assessments with information collected in the field whenever possible. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Area-based Conservation Measures; Human Footprint; Natura 2000 Network; Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework; Protected Areas; Threats To Biodiversity","","","","","Anderson, Emily, The role of protected areas in mitigating human impact in the world’s last wilderness areas, Ambio, 49, 2, pp. 434-441, (2020); Benítez-López, Ana, Intact but empty forests?

Insects contribute to the circularity of agriculture, and are ideal candidates to complement traditional sources of protein. In this context, a working programme within the European Food Risk Assessment (EU-FORA) Fellowship Programme framework was developed at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in collaboration with the Spanish National Research Council. The purpose of this technical report is to describe the activities in which the fellow was involved. As part of the training, the fellow performed a literature search regarding insects as food and allergenicity resulting in 493 hits. Out of the literature search a comprehensive scientific database with 200 publications has been built using the application ‘EndNote’. Furthermore, an extensive scientific review with the title ‘Sustainable food systems: EU regulatory framework and contribution of insects to the Farm-to-Fork strategy’ approaching several important issues regarding insects (Regulatory frame, Market situation, Labelling and Control, Application as food/feed, Consumer acceptance and Allergenicity risk assessment) has been drafted and sent for publication in a peer reviewed journal. In order to analyse the impact of food processing on the allergenicity of insects, different food samples were prepared and artificially digested using a protocol simulating the gastrointestinal tract. Further laboratory work to analyse the readouts, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), has been discussed and proposed, scheduled for the end of July. In conclusion, the present working programme, together with additional activities and training provided by different institutions, enabled the fellow to gain a broader perspective in food safety, particularly concerning insects as novel foods and their safety assessment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Allergen; Allergenicity Risk Assessment; Entomophagy; Food Safety; Insects; Novel Food; Tropomyosin","","","","","Barre, Annick, Entomophagy and the risk of allergy, Revue Francaise d'Allergologie, 54, 4, pp. 315-321, (2014); Barre, Annick, A proteomic-and bioinformatic-based identification of specific allergens from edible insects: Probes for future detection as food ingredients, Foods, 10, 2, (2021); Beaumont, Pascale, Food-induced anaphylaxis to Tenebrio molitor and allergens implicated, Revue Francaise d'Allergologie, 59, 5, pp. 389-393, (2019); Broekman, Henrike C.H.P., Primary respiratory and food allergy to mealworm, Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 140, 2, pp. 600-603.e7, (2017); de Gier, Steffie, Insect (food) allergy and allergens, Molecular Immunology, 100, pp. 82-106, (2018); Naegeli, Hanspeter, Guidance on allergenicity assessment of genetically modified plants, EFSA Journal, 15, 6, (2017); Naegeli, Hanspeter, Statement on in vitro protein digestibility tests in allergenicity and protein safety assessment of genetically modified plants, EFSA Journal, 19, 1, (2021); Mullins, Ewen, Scientific Opinion on development needs for the allergenicity and protein safety assessment of food and feed products derived from biotechnology, EFSA Journal, 20, 1, (2022); Turck, Dominique D., Safety of dried yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor larva) as a novel food pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/2283, EFSA Journal, 19, 1, (2021); Foods Derived from Modern Biotechnology, (2009)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","18314732","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144110127"

In this study we reanalyzed 36 published pollen data sets with robust chronologies from Polish Lowlands to determine the patterns of large-scale forest decline after the Migration Period (fourth to sixth century CE). The study revealed substantial heterogeneity in the old-growth forest decline patterns. Using new high-resolution studies, we could better understand the timing of this transition related to increasing economic development. After the Migration Period, forest expansion continued until the seventh to ninth centuries cal. CE, when the dawn of Slavic culture resulted in large-scale forest decline, especially in north-western and north-central Poland. Later, forest decline was recorded mainly in north-eastern Poland and was related to Prussian settlements, including activities associated with the Teutonic Order, as well as with new settlements from the fourteenth century. The composite picture shows a varied spatio-temporal forest loss and transition towards the present-day, human activity dominated landscapes. However, some sites, such as in north-eastern Poland, are characterized by a less abrupt critical transition. The pristine nature of the oak-hornbeam forest had already been destroyed in Early Medieval times (eighth to ninth centuries cal. CE) and the potential for recovery was largely lost. Our study has confirmed previous assumptions that the decline of hornbeam across the Polish Lowlands may be an early indicator of local settlement processes, preceding severe forest loss, and establishment of permanent agriculture. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Article; Chronology; Economic Development; Forest; Human; Middle Ages; Poland; Synthesis; Ecosystem; History; Tree; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Trees","agriculture; article; chronology; economic development; forest; human; Middle Ages; Poland; synthesis; ecosystem; history; tree; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Trees","","","Funding text 1: Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Particularly in urban centers, consumers have been confronted with this vulnerability, highlighting reliance on just-in-time logistics, imports and distant primary production. Urban food demand, regional food supply, land use change, and transport strategies are considered key factors for reestablishing resilient landscapes as part of a sustainable food system. Improving the sustainability of food systems in such circumstances entails working on the interrelations between food supply and demand, rural and urban food commodity production sites, and groups of involved actors and consumers. Of special significance is the agricultural land in close proximity to urban centers. Calling for more holistic approaches in the sense of inclusiveness, food security, citizen involvement and ecological principles, this article describes the use of a new decision support tool, the Metropolitan Foodscape Planner (MFP). The MFP features up-to-date European datasets to assess the potential of current agricultural land use to provide food resources (with special attention to both plant- and animal-based products) and meet the demand of city dwellers, and help to empower citizens, innovators, companies, public authorities and other stakeholders of regional food systems to build a more regionalized food supply network. The tool was tested in the context of the food system of the Copenhagen City Region in two collaborative workshops, namely one workshop with stakeholders of the Copenhagen City Region representing food consultancies, local planning authorities and researchers, and one in-person workshop masterclass with MSc students from the University of Copenhagen. Workshop participants used the tool to learn about the impacts of the current food system at the regional and international level with regard to the demand-supply paradigm of city-regions. The ultimate goal was to develop a participatory mapping exercise and test three food system scenarios for a more regionalized and sustainable food system and, therefore, with increased resilience to crises. Results from this implementation also demonstrated the potential of the tool to identify food production sites at local level that are potentially able to feed the city region in a more sustainable, nutritious and way. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collaborative Workshops; Copenhagen; Food Supply And Demand; Food Systems; Living Lab Approach; Metropolitan Foodscape Planner; Spatial Decision Support","","","","Funding text 1: This research was conducted as part of the FoodSHIFT2030 project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No. 862716.; Funding text 2: We want to thank all the members of the FoodSHIFT Accelerator Lab for the Copenhagen city region for their contributions to the practical part of this article, as well as all workshop participants, including the University of Copenhagen's students.","Journal of Business Studies, (2015); Arciniegas, Gustavo A., Spatial decision support for collaborative land use planning workshops, Landscape and Urban Planning, 107, 3, pp. 332-342, (2012); Augustin, Mary Ann, Perspective article: Towards a new venture science model for transforming food systems, Global Food Security, 28, (2021); Badami, Madhav G., Urban agriculture and food security: A critique based on an assessment of urban land constraints, Global Food Security, 4, pp. 8-15, (2015); Chokepoints and Vulnerabilities in Global Food Trade, (2017); Béné, Christophe, Resilience of local food systems and links to food security – A review of some important concepts in the context of COVID-19 and other shocks, Food Security, 12, 4, pp. 805-822, (2020); Béné, Christophe, When food systems meet sustainability – Current narratives and implications for actions, World Development, 113, pp. 116-130, (2019); Food System Impacts on Biodiversity Loss, (2021); Blay-Palmer, Alison D., City region food systems: Building resilience to COVID-19 and other shocks, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 3, pp. 1-19, (2021); Brouwer, Inge A., Food systems everywhere: Improving relevance in practice, Global Food Security, 26, (2020)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","2571581X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143361761"

On the one hand, the integration processes have intensified competition between countries, and on the other hand, they have created new opportunities for them. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of European integration on the competitiveness of the agricultural sector in countries that acceded to the EU in or after 2004. The assessment of the competitiveness of the agricultural sector was made using the following indicators: land and labour productivity in agriculture, importance of the agricultural sector in the economy of the EU countries, agricultural trade balance, importance of agricultural export in total export of the EU countries, trade coverage ratio, Grubel–Lloyd intra-industry specialization indicator, and Balassa comparative advantage indicator. The analysis was carried out from 2004 to 2020 with the Eurostat statistical database. The outcome of surveys implies that a gap still exists between the old and the new member states of the European Union (EU) in the efficient utilisation of their production factors, despite an increased dynamics of growth in labour productivity compared with the old member states, the so-called EU-15. The overall competitive position of all EU-13 countries in agricultural trade on the common EU market has improved; however, individual analysis reveals disparities between respective member states. In 2020, net exporters with comparative advantage were Hungary, Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Croatia, and net importers with comparative disadvantage included Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Estonia, and Malta.

However, little published research has investigated the alternation of PET due to climate change in the case of Iraq. The objective of the present study was to analyze the spatial trends in annual and seasonal PET in Iraq. Accordingly, the latest global ERA5-Land dataset of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for 1981–2021 was employed. The PET was estimated using the FAO-Penman–Monteith method. The modified Mann–Kendall statistical test was applied to evaluate the significance of the trends in PET, which can separate unidirectional trends caused by climate change from the natural variability of climate. The attained results indicate that: (1) Over the past four decades, the annual and seasonal PET witnessed a significant increasing trend in almost all of Iraq, except for the alluvial plain in the eastern and southeastern parts. (2) The increasing trend in PET confirmed the patterns of the trend significance, with the highest increase of 0.28–0.65 mm/decade in southwest Iraq. (3) Summer had the highest upward trend of 0.35–0.65 mm/decade, followed by spring, autumn, and winter. (4) The air temperature was the predominant driving factor of rising PET, showing a positive correlation ranging from 0.77 to 0.88 and a contribution of 26 to 94%, mainly in the south, central, and northwest regions. The reverse contribution of wind speed and surface pressure to PET, particularly in the southeast and southwest, remains offset by the influence of air temperature and net solar radiation. Overall, the PET has risen drastically due to global climate change, indicating the potential for increased atmospheric water demand in the region. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative Agriculture; Annual Variation; Evapotranspiration; Seasonal Variation; Spatial Distribution; Trend Analysis; Water Management; Iraq","alternative agriculture; annual variation; evapotranspiration; seasonal variation; spatial distribution; trend analysis; water management; Iraq","","","The authors are grateful to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for providing European Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) climate datasets through their web portal.","Desalin Water Treat, (2017); Ahmed, Kamal, Characterization of seasonal droughts in Balochistan Province, Pakistan, Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 30, 2, pp. 747-762, (2016); Journal of Earth Sciences and Geotechnical Engineering, (2018); Al-Hasani, Alaa Adel Jasim, Trend analysis and abrupt change detection of streamflow variations in the lower Tigris River Basin, Iraq, International Journal of River Basin Management, 19, 4, pp. 523-534, (2021); Crop Evapotranspiration Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements, (1998); Al-Sudani, Hussein Ilaibi Zamil, Derivation mathematical equations for future calculation of potential evapotranspiration in Iraq, a review of application of thornthwaite evapotranspiration, Iraqi Journal of Science, 60, 5, pp. 1037-1048, (2019); Anwar, Samy Ashraf, On the Influence of Vegetation Cover Changes and Vegetation-Runoff Systems on the Simulated Summer Potential Evapotranspiration of Tropical Africa Using RegCM4, Earth Systems and Environment, 5, 4, pp. 883-897, (2021); Chen, Fengwen, Estimation of the spatial rainfall distribution using inverse distance weighting (IDW) in the middle of Taiwan, Paddy and Water Environment, 10, 3, pp. 209-222, (2012); Collins, Brian, Spatiotemporal variations of evapotranspiration and reference crop water requirement over 1957–2016 in Iran based on CRU TS gridded dataset, Journal of Arid Land, 13, 8, pp. 858-878, (2021); Dinpashoh, Yagob, Trends in reference crop evapotranspiration over Iran, Journal of Hydrology, 399, 3-4, pp. 422-433, (2011)","","Springer","","","","","","14344483; 0177798X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137999074"

Therefore, high-resolution SOC maps are required. Machine learning (ML) offers new opportunities to develop these maps due to its ability to data mine large datasets. The aim of this study was to apply three algorithms commonly used in digital soil mapping - random forest (RF), boosted regression trees (BRT), and support vector machine for regression (SVR) - on the first German agricultural soil inventory to model the agricultural topsoil (0-30 cm) SOC content and develop a two-model approach to address the high variability in SOC in German agricultural soils. Model performance is often limited by the size and quality of the soil dataset available for calibration and validation. Therefore, the impact of enlarging the training dataset was tested by including data from the European Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey for agricultural sites in Germany. Nested cross-validation was implemented for model evaluation and parameter tuning. Grid search and the differential evolution algorithm were also applied to ensure that each algorithm was appropriately tuned . The SOC content of the German agricultural soil inventory was highly variable, ranging from 4 to 480 g kg-1. However, only 4% of all soils contained more than 87 g kg-1 SOC and were considered organic or degraded organic soils. The results showed that SVR produced the best performance, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 32 g kg-1 when the algorithms were trained on the full dataset. However, the average RMSE of all algorithms decreased by 34% when mineral and organic soils were modelled separately, with the best result from SVR presenting an RMSE of 21 g kg-1. The model performance was enhanced by up to 1% for mineral soils and by up to 2% for organic soils. Despite the ability of machine learning algorithms, in general, and SVR, in particular, to model SOC on a national scale, the study showed that the most important aspect for improving the model performance was to separate the modelling of mineral and organic soils. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Soil; Algorithm; Machine Learning; Organic Carbon; Organic Soil; Spatial Analysis; Topsoil; Germany","agricultural soil; algorithm; machine learning; organic carbon; organic soil; spatial analysis; topsoil; Germany","","","","Al-Anazi, Ammal F., Support vector regression to predict porosity and permeability: Effect of sample size, Computers and Geosciences, 39, pp. 64-76, (2012); C R Acad Agric Fr, (2002); Awad, Mariette, Efficient learning machines: Theories, concepts, and applications for engineers and system designers, pp. 1-248, (2015); Ballabio, Cristiano, Mapping topsoil physical properties at European scale using the LUCAS database, Geoderma, 261, pp. 110-123, (2016); Ballabio, Cristiano, Mapping LUCAS topsoil chemical properties at European scale using Gaussian process regression, Geoderma, 355, (2019); Battineni, Gopi, Machine learning in medicine: Performance calculation of dementia prediction by support vector machines (SVM), Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 16, (2019); Behrens, Thorsten, Digital soil mapping in Germany - A review, Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science, 169, 3, pp. 434-443, (2006); Behrens, Thorsten, Digital soil mapping using artificial neural networks, Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science, 168, 1, pp. 21-33, (2005); Belon, E., An inventory of trace elements inputs to French agricultural soils, Science of the Total Environment, 439, pp. 87-95, (2012); Geomorphographic Map of Germany Gmk1000, (2007)","","Copernicus Publications","","","","","","2199398X; 21993971","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140575460"

The Republic of Ireland (RoI) is characterised by the highest incidence of verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) enteritis in the European Union (EU), linked to high reliance on unregulated groundwater sources (~16% of the population). Yet, the spatio-temporal factors influencing the frequency and magnitude of microbial contamination remain largely unknown, with past studies typically constrained to spatio-temporally ‘limited’ sampling campaigns. Accordingly, the current investigation sought to analyse an extensive spatially distributed time-series (2011−2020) of groundwater monitoring data in the RoI. The dataset, compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), showed ‘high’ contamination rates, with 66.7% (88/132) of supplies testing positive for E. coli, and 29.5% (39/132) exceeding concentrations of 10MPN/100 ml (i.e. gross contamination) at least once during the 10-year monitoring period. Seasonal decomposition analyses indicate that E. coli detection rates peak during late autumn/early winter, coinciding with increases in annual rainfall, while gross contamination peaks in spring (May) and late-summer (August), likely reflecting seasonal shifts in agricultural practices. Mixed effects logistic regression modelling indicates that monitoring sources located in karst limestone are statistically associated with E. coli presence (OR = 2.76, p = 0.03) and gross contamination (OR = 2.54, p = 0.037) when compared to poorly productive aquifers (i.e., transmissivity below 10m2/d). Moreover, 5-day and 30-day antecedent rainfall increased the likelihood of E. coli contamination (OR = 1.027, p < 0.001 and OR = 1.005, p = 0.016, respectively), with the former also being associated with gross contamination (OR = 1.042, p < 0.001). As such, it is inferred that preferential flow and direct ingress of surface runoff are the most likely ingress mechanisms associated with E. coli groundwater supply contamination. The results presented are expected to inform policy change around groundwater source protection and provide insight for the development of groundwater monitoring programmes in geologically heterogeneous regions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Fate Modelling; Escherichia Coli; Groundwater Contamination; Hydrodynamics; Aquifers; Contamination; Environmental Protection Agency; Groundwater Flow; Groundwater Pollution; Groundwater Resources; Hydrogeology; Lime; Monitoring; Potable Water; Rain; Statistical Tests; Drinking Water Resources; E.

In recent decades, these habitats have been drastically altered by changes in land use as well as agricultural practices and, more recently, by climate change. These changes have precipitated substantial changes in vegetation and their spatial and temporal trajectories have not yet been exhaustively studied. Here, we present the AgriWeedClim database — a new resource of vegetation plot (relevé) data of arable habitats in Central Europe. Location: Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Hungary, Northern Italy, Slovenia, Croatia. Methods: Vegetation plot data were obtained from large repositories (e.g. European Vegetation Archive), specialized regional databases, colleagues and the literature. Data were then checked for completeness and standardized (e.g. taxonomy, nomenclature, crop types). Species were assigned native, archaeophyte (i.e. alien species introduced before c. 1492 CE) or neophyte (i.e. alien species introduced after c. 1492 CE) status. Results: The AgriWeedClim database version 1.0 contains georeferenced data from 32,889 vegetation plots sampled from 1916 to 2019. Conclusions: We provide an overview of this new resource and present example analyses to show its content and possible applications. We outline potential research questions including analysis of patterns and causes of vegetation changes in arable habitats from the early 20th century to the present. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Biological Invasions; Climate Change; Data Repository; Land-use Change; Segetal Flora; Vegetation Plots; Weeds","","","","This study was funded by the Austrian Climate Research Program (FA772033 “AgriWeedClim”).

Clouds and cloud shadows significantly decrease the usability of optical satellite data especially in agricultural applications; therefore, an accurate and reliable cloud mask is mandatory for effective Earth Observation (EO) optical data exploitation. During the last years, image segmentation techniques have developed rapidly with the exploitation of neural networks capabilities. In this perspective, the KappaMask processor using U-Net architecture was developed with the ability to generate a classification mask over northern latitudes into the following classes: clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent cloud (thin clouds), and cloud, invalid. For training, a Sentinel-2 dataset covering Northern European terrestrial area was labeled. KappaMask provides a 10 m classification mask for Sentinel-2 Level- 2A (L2A) and Level-1C (L1C) products. The total dice coefficient on the test dataset, which was not seen by the model at any stage, was 80% for KappaMask L2A and 76% for KappaMask L1C for 27 clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent, cloud classes. Comparison with rule-based cloud mask 28 methods was then performed on the same test dataset, where Sen2Cor reached 59% dice coefficient 29 for clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent, cloud classes, Fmask 61% for clear, cloud shadow, cloud 30 classes, and Maja 51% for clear and cloud classes. The closest machine learning open-source cloud classification mask, S2cloudless, has 63% dice coefficient providing only cloud and clear classes, while KappaMask L2A with a more complex classification schema outperformed S2cloudless by 17%. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active Learning; Cloud Mask; Convolutional Neural Network; Image Segmentation; Kappamask; Remote Sensing; Sentinel-2; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Earth (planet); Image Classification; Image Segmentation; Space Optics; Statistical Tests; Active Learning; Cloud Masks; Cloud Shadows; Convolutional Neural Network; Dice Coefficient; Images Segmentations; Kappamask; Remote-sensing; Semi-transparent; Sentinel-2; Remote Sensing","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Earth (planet); Image classification; Image segmentation; Space optics; Statistical tests; Active Learning; Cloud masks; Cloud shadows; Convolutional neural network; Dice coefficient; Images segmentations; Kappamask; Remote-sensing; Semi-transparent; Sentinel-2; Remote sensing","","","This study was partially supported by national authority for remote sensing and space science.","undefined; Data and Information Access Services, (2020); Copernicus Open Access Hub, (2021); French Access to the Sentinel Products, (2020); Finnish Data Hub; Main-Knorn, Magdalena, Sen2Cor for sentinel-2, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 10427, (2017); Qiu, Shi, Fmask 4.0: Improved cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsats 4–8 and Sentinel-2 imagery, Remote Sensing of Environment, 231, (2019); undefined; Zupanc, (2017); Fastai","","Korean Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences","","","","","","20932480; 2093274X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130433485"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a content and thematic analysis of 325 academic sources extracted from the Scopus database and 683 patents retrieved from the European Patent Office (EPO) dataset. Additionally, the research applies the Kruskal–Wallis test as a non-parametric test for evaluating differences in the main concepts discussed in the two sources. Findings: The academic and practitioners' debate highlights a trading zone among the two streams. patents' analysis from the EPO reveals four main common themes as a new business that benefits from AI in weather predictions, new smart and intelligent ways to monitor crops, new businesses that use clouds to control plant's humidity. The analysis of Scopus's sources demonstrates theoretical approaches related to the technology acceptance model (TAM) and practical strategies in terms of entrepreneurial skills to support the agricultural sector. However, barriers among the two streams of sources exist in innovation management and scale-up entrepreneurial initiatives. Research limitations/implications: Regarding implications, the authors aim to connect academic and practitioners' views by understanding the new potential innovation applications and the connected new research avenues. Limitations might arise from the sources used to develop our analysis. Originality/value: The paper is novel because it investigates the issues arising from the relationship between AE and new technologies by examining original validated patents released by practitioners and approved by the EPO, rather than reviewing blogs or the financial press. This leads to a holistic understanding of the impact of tangible practices among agricultural entrepreneurs. The results support the view that new trading zones and case studies are needed to highlight and show the positive impact of technologies in this field. The authors argue that practitioners require scholars to reduce the ambiguity between AE and its expected results, leading to investments to boost new agricultural business ideas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Entrepreneurship; Artificial Intelligence; Augmented Reality; Big Data; Content Analysis; Machine Learning; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Augmented Reality; Big Data; Blogging; Content Analysis; Crop; Entrepreneurship; Human; Humidity; Investment; Kruskal Wallis Test; Machine Learning; Nonhuman; Nonparametric Test; Patent; Physician; Prediction; Scale Up; Scopus; Skill; Thematic Analysis; Theoretical Study; Weather","article; artificial intelligence; augmented reality; big data; blogging; content analysis; crop; entrepreneurship; human; humidity; investment; Kruskal Wallis test; machine learning; nonhuman; nonparametric test; patent; physician; prediction; scale up; Scopus; skill; thematic analysis; theoretical study; weather","","","","Agovino, Massimiliano, Policy efficiency in the field of food sustainability.

Green public areas contribute to mitigation and adaptation strategies for addressing climate changes, but their maintenance has a significant cost. Frequent grass cutting operations must be carried out during growing periods to ensure the safe livability of UOS to citizens. In the present paper, a geo database was developed to map green public areas of the city of Latina (Lazio Region, Central Italy) by using a multisource dataset according to the European INSPIRE Directive. The GreenCAL Tool was implemented. Two algorithms to determine UOS extension and the necessary budget for grass cutting operations are used, considering the contribution of different mowing (i.e., mulcher, lawnmower, or brush cutter) and UOS extension itself (~160 ha). The implemented processing chain allowed us to simulate forestation of abandoned areas and potential CO2 sequestration values. Two different scenarios of maintenance programs were also implemented to reduce more than 60% of operational cost according to: (1) different use of UOS; (2) their position within the urban area; (3) guidelines of Italian working group on public green management; and (4) management of vegetal residues. The management of the latter, derived by mowing, contribute to more than 23% of the budget allocated to maintain UOS. Besides the long‐term environmental and health perspective, the short‐term impact of the present applied research is relevant for a geomatic approach, green public procurements, as well as land use and climate interactions. The alternative management of UOS discussed in the present paper can also reduce organic waste production if the mowing within the UOS is managed as a resource for agriculture rather than urban waste. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithms Implementation; Circular Economy; Gis; Mowing Cost; Organic Waste Management; Urban Open Spaces","","","","Funding: This research received financial support from the Italian Phosphorous Platform (https://www.piattaformaitalianafosforo.it/ accessed on 25 May 2022) managed by ENEA and funded by Ministry of Ecological Transition (Law n 205 of 27 December 2017, art. 1, c 122 and De‐ cree RIN‐DEC‐2018‐0000155 del 13/11/2018, art. 2, c. 2).","Jansson, Märit, The governance of landscape management: new approaches to urban open space development, Landscape Research, 44, 8, pp. 952-965, (2019); A Union that Strives for More My Agenda for Europe, (2019); Reynolds, Heather L., Implications of climate change for managing urban green infrastructure: an Indiana, US case study, Climatic Change, 163, 4, pp. 1967-1984, (2020); Wen, Chen, The elderly in green spaces: Exploring requirements and preferences concerning nature-based recreation, Sustainable Cities and Society, 38, pp. 582-593, (2018); Rouse, David C., Green infrastructure: A landscape approach, APA Planning Advisory Service Reports, 571, pp. 1-164, (2013); Montanarella, Luca, The relevance of sustainable soil management within the European Green Deal, Land Use Policy, 100, (2021); Simmons, Mark T., The performance of native and non-native turfgrass monocultures and native turfgrass polycultures: An ecological approach to sustainable lawns, Ecological Engineering, 37, 8, pp. 1095-1103, (2011); Smetana, Sergiy M., Sustainable plants in urban parks: A life cycle analysis of traditional and alternative lawns in Georgia, USA, Landscape and Urban Planning, 122, pp. 140-151, (2014); Tong, Jing, Reutilization of green waste as compost for soil improvement in the afforested land of the Beijing Plain, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 7, (2018); Velasco, Erik, Does urban vegetation enhance carbon sequestration?, Landscape and Urban Planning, 148, pp. 99-107, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","2073445X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135072308"

Reproducibility requires open and reusable code and data, allowing users to verify results and process new datasets. The creation of input files for global hydrological models (GHMs) requires complex high-resolution gridded dataset processing, limiting the model’s reproducibility to groups with advanced programming skills. GlobWat is one of these GHMs, which was developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to assess irrigation water use. Although the GlobWat code and sample input data are available, the methods for pre-processing model inputs are not available. Here, we present a set of open-source Python and YAML scripts within the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) that provide a formalized technique for developing and processing GlobWat model weather inputs. We demonstrate the use of these scripts with the ERA5 and ERA-Interim datasets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). To demonstrate the advantage of using these scripts, we ran the GlobWat model for 30 years for the entire world. The focus of the evaluation was on the Urmia Lake Basin in Iran. The validation of the model against the observed discharge in this basin showed that the combination of ERA5 and the De Bruin reference evaporation method yields the best GlobWat performance. Moreover, the scripts allowed us to examine the causes behind the differences in model outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Era-interim; Era5; Esmvaltool; Global Hydrological Modelling; Globwat; Reproducibility; Urmia Lake Basin; Codes (symbols); Data Handling; Earth System Models; Hydrology; Irrigation; Lakes; Open Systems; Python; Water Supply; Weather Forecasting; Earth System Model Evaluation Tool; Earth System Modeling; Era-interim; Era5; Evaluation Tool; Global Hydrological Modeling; Globwat; Hydrological Models; Lake Basins; Model Evaluation; Reproducibilities; Urmium Lake Basin; Open Source Software; Data Assimilation; Data Processing; Data Set; Discharge; Hydrological Modeling; Irrigation; Model Validation; Performance Assessment; Software; Water Use; Iran; Lake Urmia","Codes (symbols); Data handling; Earth system models; Hydrology; Irrigation; Lakes; Open systems; Python; Water supply; Weather forecasting; Earth system model evaluation tool; Earth system modeling; ERA-interim; ERA5; Evaluation tool; Global hydrological modeling; Globwat; Hydrological models; Lake basins; Model evaluation; Reproducibilities; Urmium lake basin; Open source software; data assimilation; data processing; data set; discharge; hydrological modeling; irrigation; model validation; performance assessment; software; water use; Iran; Lake Urmia","","","Funding: We acknowledge funding support from the Netherlands eScience Center through project number 027.017.F01 ‘eWatercycle II’.","Essawy, Bakinam T., Evaluation of the OntoSoft Ontology for describing metadata for legacy hydrologic modeling software, Environmental Modelling and Software, 92, pp. 317-329, (2017); Hutton, Christopher J., Most computational hydrology is not reproducible, so is it really science?, Water Resources Research, 52, 10, pp. 7548-7555, (2016); Rosenberg, David E., The Next Frontier: Making Research More Reproducible, Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management - ASCE, 146, 6, (2020); Proceedings of the Egu General Assembly, (2020); Geosci Model Dev Discuss, (2021); Hall, Caitlyn A., A hydrologist's guide to open science, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 26, 3, pp. 647-664, (2022); Essawy, Bakinam T., A taxonomy for reproducible and replicable research in environmental modelling, Environmental Modelling and Software, 134, (2020); Stagge, James H., Assessing data availability and research reproducibility in hydrology and water resources, Scientific Data, 6, (2019); Janssen, Marco A., On code sharing and model documentation of published individual and agent-based models, Environmental Modelling and Software, 134, (2020); Piccolo, Stephen R., Tools and techniques for computational reproducibility, GigaScience, 5, 1, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132816722"

However, this is frequently omitted, and the vegetation conditions are approximated by assigning constant values to static classified Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps, such as the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) Land Cover (CLC). Using as test site the Sperchios River catchment, Central Greece, this study introduces a new approach to estimate C-factor in a spatiotemporally exhaustive manner. The goal is to increase estimation accuracy in erosion modelling applications. The C-factor computations are performed on monthly scale, based on LULC maps that portray the basin's agricultural areas in unprecedented detail. The methodology involves the use of a biophysical index, namely Fraction of Vegetation Cover (F<inf>cover</inf>) and empirical literature data on crop types. F<inf>cover</inf> was developed from Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery in 10-m analysis. Such analysis (compared to the 300-m one provided by the EU) is a major improvement towards a more precise estimation of C-factor. The study identified the monthly C-factor fluctuation at basin scale, and the most susceptible months seasons at localities in terms of land cover/soil loss potential. The higher C-factor values were acquired in October and the lower in May. Mean annual (numerical) C-factor complies with the value of July. All monthly values are significantly higher – almost double – than the mean annual stationary one. The revealed patterns would not have been detected in a lower temporal (e.g., annual) resolution without the incorporation of vegetation density seasonality. The study shows high reproducibility and upscaling potential, as the utilized datasets are available in all European Union (EU) Member States, having similar structure, thus they can be harmonized towards a unified continental approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","C-factor; Cover Management Factor; Rusle; Sentinel-2; Spatiotemporal Variability; Sperchios River, Greece; European Union; Land Cover; Land Use Change; Modeling; Seasonal Variation; Seasonality; Soil Erosion; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Vegetation Cover; Central Greece; Greece; Spercheios River","European Union; land cover; land use change; modeling; seasonal variation; seasonality; soil erosion; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation cover; Central Greece; Greece; Spercheios River","","","This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund- ESF) through the Operational Programme “Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning” in the context of the project “Reinforcement of Postdoctoral Researchers - 2nd Cycle” (MIS-5033021), implemented by the State Scholarships Foundation (ΙΚΥ).","Alexakis, Dimitrios D., Towards the assessment of soil-erosion-related c-factor on european scale using google earth engine and sentinel-2 images, Remote Sensing, 13, 24, (2021); Alexandridis, Thomas K., The Effects of Seasonality in Estimating the C-Factor of Soil Erosion Studies, Land Degradation and Development, 26, 6, pp. 596-603, (2015); undefined, (1998); Arnhold, Sebastian, Conventional and organic farming: Soil erosion and conservation potential for row crop cultivation, Geoderma, 219-220, pp. 89-105, (2014); undefined, (1991); Bacour, Cédric, Neural network estimation of LAI, fAPAR, fCover and LAI×Cab, from top of canopy MERIS reflectance data: Principles and validation, Remote Sensing of Environment, 105, 4, pp. 313-325, (2006); Balkanlou, Khadijeh Rahimi, Spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystem services provision in a degraded ecosystem: A systematic assessment in the Lake Urmia basin, Iran, Science of the Total Environment, 716, (2020); Beasley, David B., ANSWERS: a model for watershed planning., Transactions - American Society of Agricultural Engineers: General Edition, 23, 4, pp. 938-944, (1980); Beguería, Santiago, Fluvial adjustments to soil erosion and plant cover changes in the Central Spanish Pyrenees, Geografiska Annaler, Series A: Physical Geography, 88, 3, pp. 177-186, (2006); Belgiu, Mariana, Sentinel-2 cropland mapping using pixel-based and object-based time-weighted dynamic time warping analysis, Remote Sensing of Environment, 204, pp. 509-523, (2018)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","03418162","","CIJPD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125266043"

In Europe, member states of the European Union collect geospatial data in the framework of the Land Parcel Information System (LPIS) for agricultural management and subsidizing farmers. These data can be exploited as training datasets of machine learning classifiers for crop-type mapping applications. However, the way the LPIS data are being generated, concerning primarily errors in the farmers' declarations in terms of crop-type labels, exact geometries, etc, constrains their direct use in such classification frameworks. In this study, we present and assess a methodology for filtering LPIS data based on geometric and spectral criteria in order to build a trustworthy training dataset for machine learning crop-type classifiers. A new nomenclature was developed, oriented towards the spectral discrimination of crop-type classes and sub-classes in Greece. The filtering methodology was applied at national scale for the agricultural year of 2019 and resulted in the selection of a sub-set of the LPIS parcels that were assessed as the most suitable and reliable to represent the different levels of the nomenclature. The developed filtering procedure was validated against actual crop-type labels derived from field visits, while the resulted filtered data were successfully utilized on various crop-type mapping experiments in Greece. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Common Agricultural Policy; Multitemporal Analysis; Sentinel-2; Spectral Profiles; Time Series; Classification (of Information); Information Management; Machine Learning; Photomapping; Remote Sensing; Terminology; Time Series Analysis; Case-studies; Common Agricultural Policy; Crop Monitoring; Crop Type Mappings; Land Parcels; Multi-temporal Analysis; Sentinel-2; Spectral Profile; Times Series; Training Dataset; Crops","Classification (of information); Information management; Machine learning; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Terminology; Time series analysis; Case-studies; Common agricultural policy; Crop monitoring; Crop type mappings; Land parcels; Multi-temporal analysis; Sentinel-2; Spectral profile; Times series; Training dataset; Crops","","","Part of this research was funded by the ’ELKE’ PhD Scholarship of the National Technical University of Athens and the ‘BiCUBES: Analysis-Ready Geospatial Big Data Cubes and Cloud-based Analytics for Monitoring Efficiently our Land & Water, Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation’ research project.

Hence, the impacts of drought on the environment and society will also increase considerably. Monitoring and early warning systems for drought rely on several indicators; however, assessments of how these indicators are linked to impacts are still lacking. Here, we explore the links between different drought indicators and drought impacts within six sub-regions in Spain. We used impact data from the European Drought Impact Report Inventory database and provide a new case study to evaluate these links. We provide evidence that a region with a small sample size of impact data can still provide useful insights regarding indicator-impact links. As meteorological drought indicators, we use the Standardised Precipitation Index and the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; as agricultural and hydrological drought indicators, we use a Standardised Soil Water Content Index and a Standardised Streamflow Index and a Standardised Reservoir Storage Index. We also explore the links between drought impacts and teleconnection patterns and surface temperature by conducting a correlation analysis, and then we test the predictability of drought impacts using a random forest model. Our results show that meteorological indices are best linked to impact occurrences overall and at long timescales between 15 and 33 months. However, we also find robust links for agricultural and hydrological drought indices, depending on the sub-region. The Arctic Oscillation, Western Mediterranean Oscillation, and the North Atlantic Oscillation at long accumulation periods (15 to 48 months) are top predictors of impacts in the northwestern and northeastern regions, the community of Madrid, and the southern regions of Spain, respectively. We also find links between temperature and drought impacts. The random forest model produces skilful models for most sub-regions. When assessed using a cross-validation analysis, the models in all regions show precision, recall, or R2 values higher than 0.97, 0.62, and 0.68, respectively. Thus, our random forest models are skilful in predicting drought impacts and could potentially be used as part of an early warning system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Atmospheric Pressure; Decision Trees; Digital Storage; Reservoirs (water); Soil Moisture; Agricultural Drought; Drought Severity; Early Warning System; Future Climate Projections; Hydrological Droughts; Impact Data; Inventory Database; Meteorological Drought; Random Forest Modeling; Sub-regions; Drought; Climate Prediction; Drought; Early Warning System; Environmental Indicator; Meteorology; Spain","Agriculture; Atmospheric pressure; Decision trees; Digital storage; Reservoirs (water); Soil moisture; Agricultural drought; Drought severity; Early Warning System; Future climate projections; Hydrological droughts; Impact data; Inventory database; Meteorological drought; Random forest modeling; Sub-regions; Drought; climate prediction; drought; early warning system; environmental indicator; meteorology; Spain","","","Financial support.

Therefore, government institutes developed guidelines to prevent heat-related illnesses and death during high heat exposures. The guidelines use Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), which integrates temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed. However, occupational heat exposure guidelines cannot be readily applied to outdoor work places due to limited WBGT validation studies. In recent years, institutions have started providing experimental WBGT forecasts. These experimental products are continually being refined and have been minimally validated with ground-based observations. This study evaluated a modified WBGT hindcast using the historical National Digital Forecast Database and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5. We verified the hindcasts with hourly WBGT estimated from ground-based weather observations. After controlling for geographic attributes and temporal trends, the average difference between the hindcast and in situ data varied from −0.64°C to 1.46°C for different Köppen-Geiger climate regions, and the average differences are reliable for decision making. However, the results showed statistically significant variances according to geographical features such as aspect, coastal proximity, land use, topographic position index, and Köppen-Geiger climate categories. The largest absolute difference was observed in the arid desert climates (1.46: 95% CI: 1.45, 1.47), including some parts of Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. This research investigates geographic factors associated with systematic WBGT differences and points toward ways future forecasts may be statistically adjusted to improve accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change Adaptation; Heat Exposure; Occupational Exposure; Weather Forecast","","","","Funding text 1: This study was partially supported by a grant from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative (U38EH000942) and the NASA HAQAST (80NSSC21K0430).

Information about the change in nitrate leaching with changes in mineral N fertilizer rates is important under such conditions. The increase in nitrate leaching due to extra mineral N application near the economic optimal N application for crop production, called marginal nitrate leaching, depends on a number of factors like soil type, crop types, climatic conditions and N fertilization rates. In this study, we collected published experimental data from 44 site-years from Denmark and 31 site-years from other European countries (Germany, Sweden, UK) with measured nitrate leaching at increasing mineral N fertilizer rates. We focused on obtaining marginal nitrate leaching around optimal N rates based on available information from the different field experiments. The measured nitrate leaching varied from 3 to 92 kg N ha-1 in the Danish dataset. For the European data set, it varied from 1 to 124 kg N ha-1. The median and mean of the estimated marginal nitrate leaching at the optimal N rates were 17.0% and 20.5%, respectively, in the Danish dataset and 9.0% and 14.9%, respectively, in the European dataset. At the optimal N rate, a positive relationship was found between yearly nitrate leaching and marginal nitrate leaching. Both nitrate leaching and marginal nitrate leaching at the optimal N rate were positively correlated with precipitation during the hydrological year and winter periods, but not to any other environmental factors tested. There was no significant difference in either marginal nitrate leaching or nitrate leaching between growing spring cereals versus winter cereals. No significant effect of winter vegetation cover on marginal nitrate leaching was detected. Furthermore, the marginal nitrate leaching at the optimal N rate in the first year of the experiments with increasing N rates was significantly lower than the accumulated effect of two or more years with low or high N rates. Therefore, the long-term effects of N rates should be accounted for when estimating marginal nitrate leaching. The marginal nitrate leaching is highly variable between years and only a part of this variation was explained in this study. The positive correlation between marginal nitrate leaching and nitrate leaching at optimum N rates implies that cropping system and management factors reducing nitrate leaching also reduce the marginal nitrate leaching. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Factors; Management; Marginal Nitrate Leaching; Nitrate Leaching; Nitrogen Fertilization Rate; Agronomy; Climate Conditions; Cropping Practice; Data Set; Environmental Factor; Fertilizer Application; Leaching; Vegetation Cover; Denmark; Germany; Sweden","agronomy; climate conditions; cropping practice; data set; environmental factor; fertilizer application; leaching; vegetation cover; Denmark; Germany; Sweden","","","This study was conducted as part of the research supporting public sector consultancy for the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries.","Ascott, Matthew J., Global patterns of nitrate storage in the vadose zone, Nature Communications, 8, 1, (2017); Askegaard, Margrethe, Nitrate leaching from organic arable crop rotations: Effects of location, manure and catch crop, Soil Use and Management, 21, 2, pp. 181-188, (2005); Askegaard, Margrethe, Nitrate leaching from organic arable crop rotations is mostly determined by autumn field management, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 142, 3-4, pp. 149-160, (2011); Ballabio, Cristiano, Mapping topsoil physical properties at European scale using the LUCAS database, Geoderma, 261, pp. 110-123, (2016); Basso, Bruno B., A strategic and tactical management approach to select optimal N fertilizer rates for wheat in a spatially variable field, European Journal of Agronomy, 35, 4, pp. 215-222, (2011); Bergstrom̈, Lars F., Effects of differentiated applications of fertilizer N on leaching losses and distribution of inorganic N in the soil, Plant and Soil, 93, 3, pp. 333-345, (1986); Eur J Agron, (2021); Brentrup, Frank, Environmental impact assessment of agricultural production systems using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology II.

Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the majority of strains isolated from poultry and turkeys from Abruzzo and Molise were closely related and belonged to one of the two main genetic clusters present in Italy, which were grouped predominantly as ESBL-producing strains that harbored pESI-like plasmid. We showed that 60% of the local strains carried multiple antibiotic resistance genes, including ESBL gene bla<inf>CTX–M–1</inf> as well as aadA1, dfrA1, dfrA14, sul1, and tet(A) genes present on the pESI-like megaplasmid. The analysis of strains from Abruzzo and Molise and the publicly available Italian S. Infantis sequences revealed a dramatic increase in the number of identified AMR genes in the strains isolated after 2011. Moreover, the number of strains resistant to five or more antibiotic classes increased from 20–80% in the last decade likely due to the acquisition of the megaplasmid. The persistence of the ESBL-producing and the multidrug-resistant (MDR) clone of S. Infantis in poultry populations in Italy and in Europe requires rapid and efficient intervention strategies to prevent further expansion of the clone. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Esbl–extended-spectrum Beta-lactamase; Genomics; Multidrug Resistance; Salmonella Infantis; Wgs–whole-genome Sequencing; Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase; Virulence Factor; Agricultural Land; Antibiotic Resistance; Article; Bacterial Strain; Computer Model; Drug Manufacture; Europe; Genome; Italy; Multidrug Resistance; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Plasmid; Salmonella Enterica Serovar Infantis; Whole Genome Sequencing","extended spectrum beta lactamase; virulence factor; agricultural land; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterial strain; computer model; drug manufacture; Europe; genome; Italy; multidrug resistance; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; phylogeny; plasmid; Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis; whole genome sequencing","","","This work was part of the One Health EJP project that had received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement no 773830(2018–2022).","Biorxiv, (2021); Alba, Patricia, Molecular epidemiology of salmonella infantis in europe: Insights into the success of the bacterial host and its parasitic pesi-like megaplasmid, Microbial Genomics, 6, 5, pp. 1-12, (2020); Fastqc Babraham Bioinformatics, (2010); Antunes, Patrícia, Salmonellosis: The role of poultry meat, Clinical Microbiology and Infection, 22, 2, pp. 110-121, (2016); Aviv, Gili, A unique megaplasmid contributes to stress tolerance and pathogenicity of an emergent Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis strain, Environmental Microbiology, 16, 4, pp. 977-994, (2014); Bankevich, Anton V., SPAdes: A new genome assembly algorithm and its applications to single-cell sequencing, Journal of Computational Biology, 19, 5, pp. 455-477, (2012); Bogomazova, Alexandra N., Mega-plasmid found worldwide confers multiple antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella Infantis of broiler origin in Russia, International Journal of Food Microbiology, 319, (2020); Bolger, Anthony M., Trimmomatic: A flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data, Bioinformatics, 30, 15, pp. 2114-2120, (2014); Borowiak, Maria, VIM-1-producing Salmonella Infantis isolated from swine and minced pork meat in Germany, Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, 72, 7, pp. 2131-2133, (2017); Carattoli, Alessandra, In Silico detection and typing of plasmids using plasmidfinder and plasmid multilocus sequence typing, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 58, 7, pp. 3895-3903, (2014)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","1664302X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128429910"

Nowadays there is limited and scattered information on where landraces are cultivated. To fill this gap and lay the groundwork for a regional landrace in situ conservation strategy, information on more than 19,335 geo-referenced landrace cultivation sites were collated from 14 European countries. According to collected data, landraces of 141 herbaceous and 48 tree species are cultivated across Europe: Italy (107 species), Greece (93), Portugal (45) and Spain (44) hold the highest numbers. Common bean, onion, tomato, potato and apple are the species of main interest in the covered countries. As from collected data, about 19.8% of landrace cultivation sites are in protected areas of the Natura 2000 network. We also got evidence that 16.7% and 19.3% of conservation varieties of agricultural species and vegetables are currently cultivated, respectively. Results of the GIS analysis allowed the identification of 1261 cells (25 km × 25 km) including all the cultivation sites, distributed across all European biogeographical regions. Data of this study constitute the largest ever produced database of in situ-maintained landraces and the first attempt to create an inventory for the entire Europe. The availability of such resource will serve for better planning of actions and development of policies to protect landraces and foster their use. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agrobiodiversity; Biogeographical Regions; Conservation Varieties; In Situ Conservation; Landrace Database; Protected Areas; Conservation; Cultivation; Database; Gis; Inventory; Europe; Greece; Italy; Portugal; Spain","conservation; cultivation; database; GIS; inventory; Europe; Greece; Italy; Portugal; Spain","","","This project was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Grant Agreement No: 774271 ‘Networking, partnerships and tools to enhance in situ conservation of European plant genetic resources’ ( Farmer's Pride ).","Altieri, Miguel Angel, The ecological role of biodiversity in agroecosystems, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 74, 1-3, pp. 19-31, (1999); Barot, Sébastien, Designing mixtures of varieties for multifunctional agriculture with the help of ecology.

The monitoring and forecasting of drought events has drawn increasing attention. However, compared with the various monthly drought indices and their wide application in drought research, daily drought indices, which would be much more suitable for drought monitoring and forecasting, are still scarce. The development of a daily drought index would improve the accuracy of drought monitoring and forecasting, and facilitate the evaluation of existing indices. In this study, we constructed a new daily drought index, the daily evapotranspiration deficit index (DEDI), based on actual and potential evapotranspiration data from the high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis dataset of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. This new index was then applied to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of four drought events that occurred in southwest, north, northeast, and eastern northwest China in the spring and summer of 2019. Comparisons with the operationally used Meteorological Drought Composite Index and another commonly used index, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, indicated that DEDI characterized the spatiotemporal evolution of the four drought events reasonably well and was superior in depicting the onset and cessation of the drought events, as well as multiple drought intensity peaks. Additionally, DEDI considers land surface conditions, such as vegetation coverage, which enables its potential application not only for meteorological purposes but also for agricultural drought warning and monitoring.

In this database, the published data for the farm types allow us to assess several agricultural policies. In fact, the FADN publishes data for the EU farming types and there are not many studies about these fields in the whole European context. This study aims to bring novelty for the whole spectrum of stakeholder types in these domains. The analysis of these impacts may bring relevant insights, especially, for adjustments in the design of future strategies and plans. We analyse the evolution of the EU farm types in the last two decades with significant scenario changes like two large common agricultural policy (CAP) reforms (2003 and 2013) and suggest new approaches to the design for future measures. Statistical information from the FADN over the period 2004-2018 is considered. In addition, efficiency and productivity assessments are carried out, to assess the implications of the most recent instruments of the CAP. The results show that the policy instruments in the framework of the 2013 CAP justify the use of more inputs (or at least at higher costs) for the same level of output.

We compared two collections of plot-based vegetation records originating from these two disciplines. The aim was to check the suitability of the collections for joint analysis and for addressing research questions from the opposing domains. We asked: are these collections complementary? If so, how can they be used for joint analysis?. Location: Europe. Methods: We compared 13 311 phytosociological relevés and 13 328 records from weed science, concerning both data collection properties and the recorded species richness. To deal with bias in the data, we also analysed different subsets (i.e., crops, geographical regions, organic vs conventional fields, center vs edge plots). Results: Records from vegetation science have an average species number of 19.0 ± 10.4. Metadata on survey methodology or agronomic practices are rare in this collection. Records from weed science have an average species number of 8.5 ± 6.4. They are accompanied by extensive methodological information. Vegetation science records and the weed science records taken at field edges or from organic fields have similar species numbers. The collections cover different parts of Europe but the results are consistent in six geographical subsets and the overall data set. The difference in species numbers may be caused by differences in methodology between the disciplines, i.e., plot positioning within fields, plot sizes, or survey timing. Conclusion: This comparison of arable weed data that were originally sampled with a different purpose represents a new effort in connecting research between vegetation scientists and weed scientists. Both collections show different aspects of weed vegetation, which means the joint use of the data is valuable as it can contribute to a more complete picture of weed species diversity in European arable landscapes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Arable Weeds; Arable Weeds And Management In Europe Data Collection; European Weed Vegetation Database; Phytosociology; Segetal Plants; Species Richness; Vegetation Survey; Vegetation-plot Data; Weed Survey","","","","The work on this project was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG (grant number BU 3097/1‐1 for Jana Bürger), Czech Science Foundation (grant number 19‐28491X for Milan Chytrý and Zdeňka Lososová), and by Slovenian Research Agency (research core funding No. P1‐0236 for Urban Šilc and Young researcher programme for Filip Küzmič)","Albrecht, Harald, Management options for the conservation of rare arable plants in Europe, Botany Letters, 163, 4, pp. 389-415, (2016); Andersson, Torsten N., Weed flora and the relative importance of site, crop, crop rotation, and nitrogen, Weed Science, 46, 1, pp. 30-38, (1998); Nature of Farming Low Intensity Farming Systems in Nine European Countries, (1994); Methode Detude Des Groupements Adventices Des Cultures Annuelles, (1976); Batáry, Péter, The former Iron Curtain still drives biodiversity-profit trade-offs in German agriculture, Nature Ecology and Evolution, 1, 9, pp. 1279-1284, (2017); Benton, Tim, Farmland biodiversity: Is habitat heterogeneity the key?, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 18, 4, pp. 182-188, (2003); Pflanzensoziologie Grundzuge Der Vegetationskunde, (1964); Bruelheide, Helge, sPlot – A new tool for global vegetation analyses, Journal of Vegetation Science, 30, 2, pp. 161-186, (2019); Bürger, Jana, Arable Weeds and Management in Europe, Vegetation Classification and Survey, 1, pp. 169-170, (2020); Merging European Arable Weed Survey Datasets Case Study Increase Accuracy of Species Distribution Models, (2018)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","14022001; 1654109X","","AVSCF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127268551"

First, an in-depth descriptive analysis of the trends in farm other gainful activities (OGA) is delineated. Second, an econometric panel regression analysis employing fractional probit model is conducted to investigate the relationship between the share of OGA and different farmer and farm characteristics. The analysis utilizes a balanced panel of 27 EU countries extracted from the Eurostat database between 2005 and 2016. The results show that OGA as main activity significantly decreased between 2005 and 2016, whereas the proportion of sole holder-managers with OGA as secondary activity slightly increased. OGA are explained by economic needs and are mostly related to farm size and farm types with lower economic farm productivity. The main OGA are mainly related to farmer characteristics (e.g. age and gender). Secondary OGA are explained by farm specialization. These trends may continue into the future which may bring an even fewer number of larger, more specialized, and more professional farms that have little time to engage in other activities than their core business of farming. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","European Union; Eurostat Panel Data; Fractional Probit Model; Off-farm Work; Other Gainful Activities; Agricultural Economics; Empirical Analysis; European Union; Farm Size; Farming System; Off-farm Employment; Panel Data; Trend Analysis; Europe","agricultural economics; empirical analysis; European Union; farm size; farming system; off-farm employment; panel data; trend analysis; Europe","","","","Ahituv, Avner, Simultaneous estimation of work choices and the level of farm activity using panel data, European Review of Agricultural Economics, 33, 1, pp. 49-71, (2006); Alasia, Alessandro, Off-farm labour decision of Canadian farm operators: Urbanization effects and rural labour market linkages, Journal of Rural Studies, 25, 1, pp. 12-24, (2009); Angioloni, Simone, The LEADER approach and drivers of job creation, Growth and Change, 50, 2, pp. 548-568, (2019); Benjamin, Catherine, Farm work, off-farm work, and hired farm labour: Estimating a discrete-choice model of French farm couples' labour decisions, European Review of Agricultural Economics, 33, 2, pp. 149-171, (2006); Biørn, Erik, What motivates farm couples to seek off-farm labour?

Large-scale analyses to assess these opportunities are hindered by the lack of a consistent, spatial and accessible forest structure data.

Building on our previous work, we used data from six additional countries and consider now ten key forest stand variables. Harmonized inventory data from 16 European countries were used in combination with remote sensing data and a gap-filling algorithm to produce this consistent and comparable forest structure data set across European forests. We showed how land cover data can be used to scale inventory data to a higher resolution which in turn ensures a consistent data structure across sub-regional, country and European forest assessments.

This paper analyses the influence of European farmers’ responsiveness to changes in agri-commodity prices on how they manage the trade-offs between agricultural expansion and forestland preservation. In so doing, we rely on a comprehensive dataset relating to European agricultural holdings over the period of 2008–2017, covering 128 regions, and use a recursive equation system that links commodity prices to economic output per area, and the latter to forestland privately owned by farmers. Controlling for farm characteristics, geographical spillovers as well as regressor endogeneity, we find results suggesting that there is indeed evidence of such a trade-off. Specifically, with increased prices, European agricultural holdings expand crop production (respectively agricultural land), which reversely conflicts with private forestland. Replicating the analysis on different subsamples confirms the robustness of these findings. Based on these results, we advocate for further incentive towards the preservation of forests privately owned by agricultural holdings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Commodity Prices; Cropland; Land-use Change; Woodland; Agricultural Land; Crop Production; Incentive; Price Determination; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Trade-off; Europe","agricultural land; crop production; incentive; price determination; spatiotemporal analysis; trade-off; Europe","","","We would like to thank the Editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

This article examines the efforts and challenges met by a French company that developed an offer of weather services based on the commodification of both open weather data and local observations produced by low-cost stations used by farmers. However, the paper shows that such commercialization of stations’ data is hampered both by their material friction with the weather infrastructure and by an economic friction related to data’s heterogeneous valuations. As solving the economic friction generated by data’s valuation is the priority of commercial meteorologists, they finally differentiate their offer using simulated weather data produced by computing models. Finally, the paper claims that the commercial process inherent to the use of this other type of data subordinates weather science to a logic of services: when designing a service for agriculture, the company considered that simulated data were more suited to digital farm advising services. In the end, it is the capacity of weather data to be integrated into private services and tools that valuate them as suited to guide farming practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Commodification; Infrastructure; Open Data; Sensors; Weather","","","","I would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers and the editors of Science, Technology, & Human Values for their useful observations and suggestions.

The multifaceted nature of biodiversity and imperfect monitoring datasets may partially explain these findings. Here, using an extensive dataset, we find significant biodiversity loss in the native avifauna of the European Union (EU). We estimate a decline of 17–19% in the overall breeding bird abundance since 1980: a loss of 560–620 million individual birds. Both total and proportional declines in bird numbers are high among species associated with agricultural land. The distribution of species’ population growth rates (ln) is centered close to zero, with numerical decline driven by substantial losses in abundant species. Our work supports previous assessments indicating substantial recent biodiversity loss and calls to reduce the threat of extinctions and restore species’ abundances, for the sake of nature and people. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assemblage; Bird; Conservation; Europe; Population Change","","","","We thank the many volunteers who contributed to national bird surveys and the scheme coordinators (Hany Alonso, Marc Anton, Ainars Auniņš, Zoltán Benkő, Mattia Brambilla, Malte Busch, Gianpiero Calvi, Tomasz Chodkiewicz, Przemyslav Chylarecki, Jordi Dalmau, Elisabetta de Carli, Juan Carlos del Moral, Antoine Derouaux, Jaanus Elts, Virginia Escandell, Daniel Palm Eskildsen, Lorenzo Fornasari, Benoît Fontaine, Ruud P.B.

Stable isotope methods, using oxygen isotopes (δ18O) in particular, are the leading forensic tools for identifying these crimes. Plant physiological stable oxygen isotope models simulate how precipitation δ18O values and climatic variables shape the δ18O values of water and organic compounds in plants. These models have the potential to simplify, speed up, and improve conventional stable isotope applications and produce temporally resolved, accurate, and precise region-of-origin assignments for agricultural food products. However, the validation of these models and thus the best choice of model parameters and input variables have limited the application of the models for the origin identification of food. In our study we test model predictions against a unique 11-year European strawberry δ18O reference dataset to evaluate how choices of input variable sources and model parameterization impact the prediction skill of the model. Our results show that modifying leaf-based model parameters specifically for fruit and with product-independent, but growth time specific environmental input data, plant physiological isotope models offer a new and dynamic method that can accurately predict the geographic origin of a plant product and can advance the field of stable isotope analysis to counter food fraud. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We thank the editor for the opportunity to address the reviewers\u2019 comments, the numerous sample collectors who were responsible for collecting samples for the reference dataset over the last 13 years, and the Agroisolab team for the sample preparation and analysis.

Soil spectroscopy in the visible-near infrared range is a fast and cost-effective analytical technique to predict soil properties. Although traditional machine learning methods are widely used for modeling soil spectral data, large spectral datasets may require better analytical methods for big data. Here, we explored the modeling potential of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for soil properties based on a large soil spectral library. The European topsoil dataset provided by the Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) was used for DCNN modeling with the original absorbance spectra. Two single-task 16-layer DCNN models (LucasResNet-16 and LucasVGGNet-16) were used to make regression predictions of seven soil properties and classification predictions of soil texture. The effects of data pre-processing on single-task and multi-task DCNN modeling were assessed. The SHapley Additive exPlanations method was used to interpret the output of a DCNN model (LucasResNet-16). The DCNN models produced accurate predictions for most soil properties, and were superior to a single-task shallow convolutional neural network and traditional machine learning methods. Spectral transformation was effective for predicting some soil properties, while spectral downsampling led to a reduction in the modeling accuracy. The performance of a multi-task DCNN model built on the basis of LucasResNet-16 was improved compared with the performance of the single-task model. Soil organic carbon content, nitrogen content, cation exchange capacity, pH, and calcium carbonate content were well predicted, with the root mean squared error of 19.130 g∙kg−1, 0.971 g∙kg−1, 6.614 cmol(+)∙kg−1, 0.326, and 24.526 g∙kg−1, respectively. The overall classification accuracy of soil texture was 0.749 (four groups) and 0.566 (12 levels). The position of feature wavelengths differed among the soil properties, for which multiple characteristic peaks were common. This study fully demonstrates the modeling potential of deep learning with soil ultraspectral data, which could enhance precision agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Feature Wavelengths; Lucas Topsoil Dataset; Soil Properties; Soil Spectral Library; Agriculture; Calcium Carbonate; Convolution; Cost Effectiveness; Data Handling; Deep Neural Networks; Forecasting; Infrared Devices; Large Dataset; Mean Square Error; Organic Carbon; Radial Basis Function Networks; Soils; Textures; Convolutional Neural Network; Cover Areas; Deep Learning; Feature Wavelength; Land Use/cover; Land Use/cover Area Frame Survey Topsoil Dataset; Machine Learning Methods; Neural Network Modelling; Soil Property; Spectral Libraries; Land Use; Analytical Method; Land Cover; Land Use; Nonrenewable Resource; Organic Carbon; Soil Property; Soil Texture; Spectral Analysis; Topsoil","Agriculture; Calcium carbonate; Convolution; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Infrared devices; Large dataset; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Radial basis function networks; Soils; Textures; Convolutional neural network; Cover areas; Deep learning; Feature wavelength; Land use/cover; Land use/cover area frame survey topsoil dataset; Machine learning methods; Neural network modelling; Soil property; Spectral libraries; Land use; analytical method; land cover; land use; nonrenewable resource; organic carbon; soil property; soil texture; spectral analysis; topsoil","","","Funding text 1: The LUCAS topsoil dataset used in this work was made available by the European Commission through the European Soil Data Centre managed by the Joint Research Centre (http://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/).

We investigate the war’s impact on the country’s atmospheric ammonia (NH<inf>3</inf>) from 2008 to 2019, using measurements from the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer instrument on board the Metop satellites. We examine the changes in NH<inf>3</inf> close to a fertilizer industry, whose activities were suspended due to conflict-related events. We also explore the effect of war-induced land use/land cover changes on agriculture-emitted ammonia in north-east Syria that has witnessed battles between different groups. The interpretation of the changes in NH<inf>3</inf> is supported by different datasets: visible satellite imagery to assess the effect on industrial activity, reanalysis data from the European center for medium-range weather forecasts to look at the effect of meteorology (temperature, wind speed, and precipitation), and land cover and burned area products from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) to examine land use/land cover changes and fire events during the study period. We show that the NH<inf>3</inf> columns are directly affected by the war.

Clouds and cloud shadows significantly decrease the usability of optical satellite data, especially in agricultural applications; therefore, an accurate and reliable cloud mask is mandatory for effective EO optical data exploitation. During the last few years, image segmentation techniques have developed rapidly with the exploitation of neural network capabilities. With this perspective, the KappaMask processor using U-Net architecture was developed with the ability to generate a classification mask over northern latitudes into the following classes: Clear, cloud shadow, semitransparent cloud (thin clouds), cloud and invalid. For training, a Sentinel-2 dataset covering the Northern European terrestrial area was labelled. KappaMask provides a 10 m classification mask for Sentinel-2 Level-2A (L2A) and Level-1C (L1C) products. The total dice coefficient on the test dataset, which was not seen by the model at any stage, was 80% for KappaMask L2A and 76% for KappaMask L1C for clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent and cloud classes. A comparison with rule-based cloud mask methods was then performed on the same test dataset, where Sen2Cor reached 59% dice coefficient for clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent and cloud classes, Fmask reached 61% for clear, cloud shadow and cloud classes and Maja reached 51% for clear and cloud classes. The closest machine learning open-source cloud classification mask, S2cloudless, had a 63% dice coefficient providing only cloud and clear classes, while KappaMask L2A, with a more complex classification schema, outperformed S2cloudless by 17%. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Active Learning; Cloud Mask; Convolutional Neural Network; Image Segmentation; Kappamask; Remote Sensing; Sentinel-2; Convolutional Neural Networks; Earth (planet); Image Segmentation; Space Optics; Statistical Tests; Active Learning; Cloud Masks; Cloud Shadows; Convolutional Neural Network; Dice Coefficient; Images Segmentations; Kappamask; Remote-sensing; Semi-transparent; Sentinel-2; Remote Sensing","Convolutional neural networks; Earth (planet); Image segmentation; Space optics; Statistical tests; Active Learning; Cloud masks; Cloud shadows; Convolutional neural network; Dice coefficient; Images segmentations; Kappamask; Remote-sensing; Semi-transparent; Sentinel-2; Remote sensing","","","Funding: This research was funded by European Space Agency, Contract No. 4000132124/20/I-DT.","Main-Knorn, Magdalena, Sen2Cor for sentinel-2, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 10427, (2017); Qiu, Shi, Fmask 4.0: Improved cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsats 4–8 and Sentinel-2 imagery, Remote Sensing of Environment, 231, (2019); Maja; Improving Cloud Detection with Machine Learning, (2017); undefined; undefined; Drönner, Johannes, Fast cloud segmentation using convolutional neural networks, Remote Sensing, 10, 11, (2018); Wieland, Marc, Multi-sensor cloud and cloud shadow segmentation with a convolutional neural network, Remote Sensing of Environment, 230, (2019); Jeppesen, Jacob Høxbroe, A cloud detection algorithm for satellite imagery based on deep learning, Remote Sensing of Environment, 229, pp. 247-259, (2019); Foga, Steve, Cloud detection algorithm comparison and validation for operational Landsat data products, Remote Sensing of Environment, 194, pp. 379-390, (2017)","","MDPI","","","","","","20724292","9780891814184; 0891814183; 9780123694072","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117699143"

Such surfaces restrain the natural infiltration of water, and directly affect the non-point source pollution. Thus, consequential events like flooding and surface water degradation require spatial and quantitative information on impervious surfaces. Remote sensing technologies are widely used in impervious surface mapping of various geographical locations for environmental monitoring. In this study, the datasets from recently launched European Space Agency satellites (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) and random forest classifier are used. The impervious surface growth of the study area, Lahore city, in 2015 and 2021, and growth trends are assessed. Results are validated with classification accuracy and comparison with similar datasets. The objective is to develop a reliable impervious surface mapping method with land cover quantification technique from multisource datasets. With a chi-square value of greater than 3.84 obtained from the McNemar test, the performance of fused data was superior to that of optical alone data in the classification. Over a 5-year period, Lahore grew at an annual rate of 2.14% comparable to the findings of Copernicus Land Services and the Atlas of Urban Expansion with an underestimation of 1% and 8.75%, respectively. Improvements in overall accuracy (2.7%) and kappa coefficient (5%) were seen in classified maps from fused datasets. Fusion of Sentinel datasets provide a reliable means of impervious surface mapping at city scale as an indicator of environmental quality which is valuable for the sustainable management of the city. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Fusion; Environmental Monitoring; Land Cover Classification; Random Forest; Sentinel Images; Urban Monitoring; Agricultural Robots; Classification (of Information); Decision Trees; Environmental Technology; Remote Sensing; River Pollution; Surface Waters; Sustainable Development; Urban Planning; Classification Accuracy; Environmental Monitoring; Geographical Locations; Non-point Source Pollution; Quantitative Information; Random Forest Classifier; Remote Sensing Technology; Sustainable Management; Mapping; Algorithm; Data Processing; Environmental Monitoring; Land Classification; Land Cover; Mapping; Satellite Data; Satellite Imagery; Sentinel; Article; Classifier; Kappa Statistics; Land Use; Mcnemar Test; Random Forest; Remote Sensing; City; Nonpoint Source Pollution; Urbanization; Lahore; Pakistan; Punjab [pakistan]; Indicator Indicator; Satellites; Cities; Non-point Source Pollution; Satellite Imagery; Urbanization","Agricultural robots; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Environmental technology; Remote sensing; River pollution; Surface waters; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Classification accuracy; Environmental Monitoring; Geographical locations; Non-point source pollution; Quantitative information; Random forest classifier; Remote sensing technology; Sustainable management; Mapping; algorithm; data processing; environmental monitoring; land classification; land cover; mapping; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; article; classifier; kappa statistics; land use; McNemar test; random forest; remote sensing; city; nonpoint source pollution; urbanization; Lahore; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Indicator indicator; Satellites; Cities; Non-Point Source Pollution; Satellite Imagery; Urbanization","","","","Alphan, Hakan, Post-classification comparison of land cover using multitemporal Landsat and ASTER imagery: The case of Kahramanmaras, Turkey, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 151, 1-4, pp. 327-336, (2009); Abdel-Hamid, Ayman, Mapping mangroves extents on the Red Sea coastline in Egypt using polarimetric SAR and high resolution optical remote sensing data, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 3, (2018); Abd Manaf, Syaifulnizam, Comparison of classification techniques on fused optical and SAR images for shoreline extraction: A case study at Northeast Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, Journal of Computer Science, 12, 8, pp. 399-411, (2016); Adnan, Mohammed Sarfaraz Gani, The effects of changing land use and flood hazard on poverty in coastal Bangladesh, Land Use Policy, 99, (2020); Rennes Metropolitan Area France, (2016); Agüera-Vega, Francisco, Using texture analysis to improve per-pixel classification of very high resolution images for mapping plastic greenhouses, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 63, 6, pp. 635-646, (2008); Atlas of Urban Expansion, (2012); Arnold, Chester L., Impervious Surface Coverage: The Emergence of a Key Environmental Indicator, Journal of the American Planning Association, 62, 2, pp. 243-258, (1996); Int J Eng Appl Sci, (2023); Attema, Evert P.W., Sentinel-1 ESA's new European radar observatory, Proceedings of the European Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar, EUSAR, 1-4, (2008)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","15732959; 01676369","","EMASD","34357458","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112399609"

The agricultural land cover category includes various types of land use with different levels of human impact. The heterogeneity and spatial structure of these landscapes vary among regions and countries, but the decline of farmland bird species population can be observed in almost all European countries. This decrease can be detected from the abundance data of farmland birds, such as the Eurasian skylark (Alauda arvensis). Some small-scale studies have analysed the relation between country and regional-level land cover types and the population data of farmland birds. Europe-wide analysis is necessary to detect the land use land cover (LULC) types that are suitable habitat for the skylark and to compare the population density data of skylarks in Hungary and Schleswig-Holstein, with the pan-European LULC datasets. In this study, we used the Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2012 dataset from the European Union and two (Hungarian and German) bird monitoring datasets were aggregated at the same grid size (5 × 5 km). Based on the CLC land cover dataset, we identified the land cover types of the Eurasian skylark habitat. We performed our statistical calculations by generalised linear models (GLMs) in R to determine the impact of land cover types on the abundance of skylarks. We applied negative binomial models to account for the over-dispersion of the skylark abundance data and the step AIC function with the stepwise function in both directions. In Hungary, we found a significant positive relation between skylark abundance and the Natural grassland LULC category and six significant negative relation s (e.g., Fruit trees and berry plantations; Complex cultivation patterns and Forests). In Schleswig-Holstein, we found significant positive relations between skylark abundance and Pastures and Natural grasslands. We identified the land cover types which shows positive relation s with skylark abundance as skylark habitat areas and the land cover types with negative relations with skylark abundance as skylark non-habitat areas. We calculated the habitat and non-habitat areas of the Eurasian skylark for each grid size (5 × 5 km) of CLC database and visualised the habitat changes between 2000 and 2018. We calculated habitat changes of European countries and compared it with the country level population change data of Eurasian skylark. Based on this he European-scale habitat change map of skylark we can detect habitat change hotspots of this farmland bird in European scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corine Land Cover; Eurasian Skylark; Habitat Change; Habitat Change Estimation; Land Cover; Land Cover Change; Abundance; Agricultural Land; Habitat Fragmentation; Land Cover; Passerine; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Germany; Hungary; Alauda; Alauda Arvensis","abundance; agricultural land; habitat fragmentation; land cover; passerine; population density; population dynamics; Germany; Hungary; Alauda; Alauda arvensis","","","This Work Was Supported By The New National Excellence Program Of The Ministry For Innovation And Technology From The Source Of The National Research, Development And Innovation Fund [Grant Number Unkp-20-3-Szte-515]","Báldi, András, Long-term changes of farmland game populations in a post-socialist country (Hungary), Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 118, 1-4, pp. 307-311, (2007); Package Mumin, (2013); Berg, Åke, Linking occurrence and changes in local abundance of farmland bird species to landscape composition and land-use changes, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 204, pp. 1-7, (2015); Corine Land Cover Technical Guide Addendum 2000, (2000); Birds of the Western Palearctic, (1980); Csikós, Nándor, Impact of energy landscapes on the abundance of Eurasian Skylark (Alauda arvensis), an example from North Germany, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 2, (2020); Hungarian Bird Migration Atlas, (2009); Daskalova, Gergana N., Population responses of farmland bird species to agri-environment schemes and land management options in Northeastern Scotland, Journal of Applied Ecology, 56, 3, pp. 640-650, (2019); Thematic Accuracy of Clc 2000, (2006); Clc Update Clc 2000 Project, (2017)","","Earth and Environmental Team, Romania","","","","","","18424090; 1844489X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118985906"

Undoubtedly, warmer winters and earlier springs produce changes in frost regimes and severity that will affect the sustainability of agricultural production in the area. The Mediterranean region and the Iberian Peninsula (IP) are among the areas where the greatest impact of climate change is expected. Daily data from 68 weather stations of the IP belonging to the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (1975-2018) were used to conduct a spatiotemporal study of the frost regime. The variables calculated include the probability of three frost types according to their severity, frost day, mean absolute minimum yearly temperature, first frost day, last frost day, and frost-free period. These variables were integrated into a geographic information system, which allowed the graphical visualization of their patterns using of geostatistical interpolation techniques (kriging). Changes in frost variables were investigated using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator. A general reduction in the number of frosts per year is observed (values between −0.04- and −0.8- day frosts per year), as well as an increase in the mean absolute minimum temperature (values between 0.04 and 0.10 °C per year), with very high significant trends throughout the territory. The reduction in the number of frosts is more pronounced at a higher elevation. Frost dates vary greatly due to the orographic characteristics of the IP. The generalized trend is of a significant delay of the autumn frosts (values between 0.4 and 1.06 days/year), as well as early spring frosts (between −0.429 and −1.29 days/year), and as a consequence a longer frost-free period, all changes were much stronger than those found in other regions of the world. These effects of climate change must be mitigated by modifying species, varieties, and cultivation techniques to guarantee sustainable agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agroclimatology; Climate Trends; Freezing Temperatures; Mediterranean Region; Spatiotemporal Patterns; Agricultural Production; Climate Change; Environmental Assessment; Frost; Gis; Mediterranean Environment; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Sustainability; Visualization; Iberian Peninsula","agricultural production; climate change; environmental assessment; frost; GIS; Mediterranean environment; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; visualization; Iberian Peninsula","","","Funding: This research was funded by the Junta de Extremadura and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the projects GR18086 (Research Group TIC008), GR18088 (Research Group RNM028), and GR18011 (Research Group RNM011).","Parker, Johnson, Cold resistance in woody plants, Botanical Review, 29, 2, pp. 123-201, (1963); Luo, Qunying, Temperature thresholds and crop production: A review, Climatic Change, 109, 3-4, pp. 583-598, (2011); Hatfield, Jerry L., Temperature extremes: Effect on plant growth and development, Weather and Climate Extremes, 10, pp. 4-10, (2015); Fruticultura De Zonas Templadas, (1982); Rodrigo, Javier, Spring frosts in deciduous fruit trees.

The most efficient tools to improve the management conditions and utilise the potential of land are land consolidation works aimed at creating more favourable management conditions in agriculture and forestry through improving the territorial structure of farms, forests and forestland; the reasonable configuration of land, aligning the limits of real properties with the system of irrigation; and drainage facilities, roads and terrain. The development of agriculture in Poland and its production capacity are considerably differentiated in terms of space. At present, Poland has agricultural areas which, in many respects, have a chance of competing with agriculture in the other member states of the European Union. However, in some areas, agricultural production run by private farms owned by individuals is on the verge of falling below the limit of profitability or falls below the limit of profitability. Currently, Poland lacks tools (strategies) allowing identification of land for intensive agricultural production as well as information about agricultural land that should be developed for non-agricultural purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a methodology for identifying similar areas using available tools that can facilitate reliable identification of the areas relating to the indicated factors. Taxonomic methods can be used for clustering purposes. The study materials are data derived from real property register databases referring to one of the districts (poviats) situated in east-central Poland. As a final result, a method of clustering villages according to similar land-use categories was developed. It was created using two independent statistical methods: Ward’s method and the complete-linkage method.

A high index of similarity of both methods—the so-called Rand index—testified to the reliability of the results of calculations.

Most research is still mostly relying on optical satellite imagery for these tasks, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is often neglected. Therefore, this research assessed the classification accuracy using the recent Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR and Sentinel-2 (S2) time-series data for LC mapping, especially vegetation classes. Additionally, ancillary data, such as texture features, spectral indices from S1 and S2, respectively, as well as digital elevation model (DEM), were used in different classification scenarios. Random Forest (RF) was used for classification tasks using a proposed hybrid reference dataset derived from European Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey (LUCAS), CORINE, and Land Parcel Identification Systems (LPIS) LC database. Based on the RF variable selection using Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA), the combination of S1 and S2 data yielded the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 91.78%, with a total disagreement of 8.22%. The most pertinent features for vegetation mapping were GLCM Mean and Variance for S1, NDVI, along with Red and SWIR band for S2, whereas the digital elevation model produced major classification enhancement as an input feature. The results of this study demonstrated that the aforementioned approach (i.e., RF using a hybrid reference dataset) is well-suited for vegetation mapping using Sentinel imagery, which can be applied for large-scale LC classifications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Corine; Feature Selection; Lucas; Mda; Random Forest; Sar; Sentinel; Agricultural Robots; Decision Trees; Digital Instruments; Geomorphology; Land Use; Large Dataset; Mapping; Radar Imaging; Random Forests; Satellite Imagery; Surveying; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Textures; Time Series; Vegetation; Classification Accuracy; Classification Tasks; Digital Elevation Model; Heterogeneous Landscapes; Land Parcel Identification Systems; Optical Satellite Imagery; Random Forest Classification; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Classification (of Information)","Agricultural robots; Decision trees; Digital instruments; Geomorphology; Land use; Large dataset; Mapping; Radar imaging; Random forests; Satellite imagery; Surveying; Synthetic aperture radar; Textures; Time series; Vegetation; Classification accuracy; Classification tasks; Digital elevation model; Heterogeneous landscapes; Land parcel identification systems; Optical satellite imagery; Random forest classification; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Classification (of information)","","","This research was funded by the Croatian Science Foundation for the GEMINI project: “Geospatial Monitoring of Green Infrastructure by Means of Terrestrial, Airborne and Satellite Imagery” (Grant No. HRZZIP-2016-06-5621); and by the University of Zagreb for the project: “Advanced photogrammetry and remote sensing methods for environmental change monitoring” (Grant No. RS4ENVIRO).","Gong, Peng, Finer resolution observation and monitoring of global land cover: First mapping results with Landsat TM and ETM+ data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 34, 7, pp. 2607-2654, (2013); Liu, Xiaoping, A future land use simulation model (FLUS) for simulating multiple land use scenarios by coupling human and natural effects, Landscape and Urban Planning, 168, pp. 94-116, (2017); Mercier, Audrey, Evaluation of Sentinel-1 and 2 time series for land cover classification of forest-agriculture mosaics in temperate and tropical landscapes, Remote Sensing, 11, 8, (2019); Dobrinić, Dino, Integration of multitemporal sentinel-1 and sentinel-2 imagery for land-cover classification using machine learning methods, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 43, B1, pp. 91-98, (2020); Zhang, Xiaoyang, Monitoring vegetation phenology using MODIS, Remote Sensing of Environment, 84, 3, pp. 471-475, (2003); Gao, Feng, Fusing Landsat and MODIS Data for Vegetation Monitoring, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine, 3, 3, pp. 47-60, (2015); Schultz, Michael, Performance of vegetation indices from Landsat time series in deforestation monitoring, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 52, pp. 318-327, (2016); Bhandari, Santosh Prasad, Preparing Landsat Image Time Series (LITS) for monitoring changes in vegetation phenology in Queensland, Australia, Remote Sensing, 4, 6, pp. 1856-1886, (2012); Vuolo, Francesco, How much does multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data improve crop type classification?, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 72, pp. 122-130, (2018); Sonobe, Rei, Assessing the suitability of data from Sentinel-1A and 2A for crop classification, GIScience and Remote Sensing, 54, 6, pp. 918-938, (2017)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","20724292","9780891814184; 0891814183; 9780123694072","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108637379"

Some of these compounds are precursors of the essential nutrient vitamin A. The present work is aimed at implementing a database of carotenoid contents of foods available in the European market. Factors affecting carotenoid content were also discussed. Analytical data available in peer-reviewed scientific literature from 1990 to 2018 and obtained by HPLC/UHPLC were considered. The database includes foods classified according to the FoodEx2 system and will benefit compilers, nutritionists and other professionals in areas related to food and human health. The results show the importance of food characterization to ensure its intercomparability, as large variations in carotenoid levels are observed between species and among varieties/cultivars/landraces. This highlights the significance of integrating nutritional criteria into agricultural choices and of promoting biodiversity. The uncertainty quantification associated with the measurements of the carotenoid content was very rarely evaluated in the literature consulted. According to the EuroFIR data quality evaluation system for food composition tables, the total data quality index mean was 24 in 35, reflecting efforts by researchers in the analytical methods, and less resources in the sampling plan documentation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agro-food; Agronomy; Food Composition; Fruits And Vegetables","","","","This research article is based upon work from COST Action EUROCAROTEN (European network to advance carotenoid research and applications in agro-food and health, CA15136, www. eurocaroten.eu; accessed on 1 February 2021), supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology, http://www.cost.eu/; accessed on 1 February 2021).","Dias, M.

For most diet items, these values are based on a large number of residue studies. However, the default residues per unit dose (RUD; standardized for application of 1 kg substance per hectare) values for fruits were taken from a few literature trials of unclear relevance for regulatory purposes. These trials were conducted according to neither current European Union (EU) agricultural practice nor to recommendations given in the GD about how to conduct wildlife-relevant residue studies. Therefore, field study data on fruit residue levels from applications of pesticides in fruiting crops were compiled and evaluated. Corresponding studies had been conducted during the last 26 y in the EU. In the final data set, 291 studies provided 1002 residue values in different fruits, including grapes, berries (currants, raspberries, gooseberries), fruits from orchards (apple, peach, pear, lemon, mandarin, orange, apricot, cherry, plum), gourds (pumpkins, cucumbers, squash, melons), and strawberries. This data set provides a basis for revising registration-relevant RUD values for fruits as potential diet items for birds and mammals in environmental wildlife risk assessments. The objective of this study was to estimate the resulting residue levels in different fruits determined under field conditions following the application of pesticides across their growing areas within the EU in diverse climatic areas that can be used directly in wildlife risk assessments. The large data set of usually about more than 100 residue values per “fruit group,” all evaluated at EU member state level, revealed significantly lower RUDs compared to the current default RUDs presented in the GD. These new RUD values for fruits should be considered for use as default values in future bird and mammal risk assessments and in respective guidance documents.

In this study, a comprehensive model to estimate crop growth and irrigation requirements of 26 main crops at global scale is presented. The model computes a soil water balance using daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration based on a high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis dataset from the European Copernicus Program. The irrigation requirement, defined as the minimum water volume to avoid water stress, is computed for year 2000 at the resolution of 5 arc-min (or 0.0833°) and aggregated at different spatial and temporal scales for relevant analyses. The estimated global irrigation requirements for 962 km3 is described in detail, also in relation to the spatial variability and to the monthly variation of the requirements. A focus on different areas of the world (California, Northern Italy and India) highlights the wealth of information provided by the model in different climatic conditions. National data of irrigation withdrawals have been used for an extensive comparison with model results. A crop-specific validation has also been made for the State of California, comparing model results with local data of irrigation volume and independent estimates of crop water use. In both cases, we found a good agreement between model results and real data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Soil; Article; California; Climate Change; Crop Production; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Parameters; Evapotranspiration; Geographic Distribution; India; Irrigation (agriculture); Italy; Minimum Water Volume; Precipitation; Soil Property; Soil Water Balance; Validation Process; Water Stress; Agriculture; Computer Simulation; Crop; Factual Database; Growth, Development And Aging; International Cooperation; Procedures; Soil; Theoretical Model; Water Supply; Agricultural Irrigation; Agriculture; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Databases, Factual; Internationality; Models, Theoretical; Soil; Water Resources","Article; California; climate change; crop production; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; evapotranspiration; geographic distribution; India; irrigation (agriculture); Italy; minimum water volume; precipitation; soil property; soil water balance; validation process; water stress; agriculture; computer simulation; crop; factual database; growth, development and aging; international cooperation; procedures; soil; theoretical model; water supply; Agricultural Irrigation; Agriculture; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Databases, Factual; Internationality; Models, Theoretical; Soil; Water Resources","","Soil","","World Bank, (2020); Irrigation Challenge, (2003); Sloat, Lindsey L., Climate adaptation by crop migration, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); Hanjra, Munir A., Global water crisis and future food security in an era of climate change, Food Policy, 35, 5, pp. 365-377, (2010); Döll, Petra, Global modeling of irrigation water requirements, Water Resources Research, 38, 4, pp. 8-8-10, (2002); de Fraiture, Charlotte M.S., Integrated water and food analysis at the global and basin level.

In recent years, tropospheric ozone has been recognized as an important greenhouse gas and pollutant that is detrimental to human health, agriculture, and natural ecosystems, and has shown a trend of increasing interest. Machinelearning- based approaches have been widely applied to the estimation of tropospheric ozone concentrations, but few studies have included tropospheric ozone profiles. This study aimed to predict the Northern Hemisphere distribution of Lower-Stratosphere-to-Troposphere (LST) ozone at a pressure of 100 hPa to the near surface by employing a deep learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. We referred to a history of all the observed parameters (meteorological data of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), satellite data, and the ozone profiles of the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC)) between 2014 and 2018 for training the predictive models. Model-measurement comparisons for the monitoring sites of WOUDC for the period 2019-2020 show that the mean correlation coefficients (R2) in the Northern Hemisphere at high latitude (NH), Northern Hemisphere at middle latitude (NM), and Northern Hemisphere at low latitude (NL) are 0.928, 0.885, and 0.590, respectively, indicating reasonable performance for the LSTM forecasting model. To improve the performance of the model, we applied the LSTM migration models to the Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container (CARIBIC) flights in the Northern Hemisphere from 2018 to 2019 and three urban agglomerations (the Sichuan Basin (SCB), North China Plain (NCP), and Yangtze River Delta region (YRD)) between 2018 and 2019. The results show that our models performed well on the CARIBIC data set, with a high R2 equal to 0.754. The daily and monthly surface ozone concentrations for 2018-2019 in the three urban agglomerations were estimated from meteorological and ancillary variables. Our results suggest that the LSTM models can accurately estimate the monthly surface ozone concentrations in the three clusters, with relatively high coefficients of 0.815-0.889, root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.769-8.729 ppb, and mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 6.111-6.930 ppb. The daily scale performance was not as high as the monthly scale performance, with the accuracy of R2 = 0.636~0.737, RMSE = 14.543-16.916 ppb, MAE = 11.130-12.687 ppb. In general, the trained module based on LSTM is robust and can capture the variation of the atmospheric ozone distribution. Moreover, it also contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of air pollution, especially increasing our comprehension of pollutant areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Era5; Lower-stratosphere-to-troposphere; Lstm; Ozone Profile; Satellite Data; Agglomeration; Agricultural Robots; Air Pollution; Atmospheric Chemistry; Brain; Climate Change; Deep Learning; Greenhouse Gases; Mean Square Error; Ozone; Predictive Analytics; River Pollution; Training Aircraft; Troposphere; Weather Forecasting; Correlation Coefficient; European Centre For Medium-range Weather Forecasts; Forecasting Modeling; Root Mean Square Errors; Surface Ozone Concentrations; Tropospheric Ozone Concentration; Tropospheric Ozone Profiles; Urban Agglomerations; Long Short-term Memory","Agglomeration; Agricultural robots; Air pollution; Atmospheric chemistry; Brain; Climate change; Deep learning; Greenhouse gases; Mean square error; Ozone; Predictive analytics; River pollution; Training aircraft; Troposphere; Weather forecasting; Correlation coefficient; European centre for medium-range weather forecasts; Forecasting modeling; Root mean square errors; Surface ozone concentrations; Tropospheric ozone concentration; Tropospheric ozone profiles; Urban agglomerations; Long short-term memory","","","Funding: This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 91644216, 41771391), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC0213903, 2018YFC0213904), Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA19010403, XDA19040201), Guangxi Key Research and Development Project (Grant No. Guike AB20238015), TUOHAI special project (Grant No. HBHZX202002) 2020 and the project of Excellent and Middle‐aged Scientific Research Innovation Team of Northeast Petroleum University (Grant No. KYCXTD201903).","Lelieveld, Jos, What controls tropospheric ozone?, Journal of Geophysical Research, 105, D3, pp. 3531-3551, (2000); Rieder, Harald E., Are recent Arctic ozone losses caused by increasing greenhouse gases?, Geophysical Research Letters, 40, 16, pp. 4437-4441, (2013); Baasandorj, Munkhbayar, O(1D) kinetic study of key ozone depleting substances and greenhouse gases, Journal of Physical Chemistry A, 117, 12, pp. 2434-2445, (2013); Ma, Pengfei, Ozone Profile Retrievals from the Cross-Track Infrared Sounder, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 54, 7, pp. 3985-3994, (2016); Young, Paul J., Tropospheric ozone assessment report: Assessment of global-scale model performance for global and regional ozone distributions, variability, and trends, Elementa, 6, (2018); Mills, Gina E., A synthesis of AOT40-based response functions and critical levels of ozone for agricultural and horticultural crops, Atmospheric Environment, 41, 12, pp. 2630-2643, (2007); Taylan, Osman, Modelling and analysis of ozone concentration by artificial intelligent techniques for estimating air quality, Atmospheric Environment, 150, pp. 356-365, (2017); Air Pollution and Health, (2006); Lupaşcu, A., Source attribution of European surface O3 using a tagged O3 mechanism, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 19, 23, pp. 14535-14558, (2019); Li, Jingyi, Decadal changes in summertime reactive oxidized nitrogen and surface ozone over the Southeast United States, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 18, 3, pp. 2341-2361, (2018)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","20724292","9780891814184; 0891814183; 9780123694072","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104076135"

Intercropping is known to be a sustainable means of reducing the use of N-fertilizers. However, managing the N supplied to a crop while optimising the use of N by different species in a mixture remains a challenge. This is partly due to the difficulty of assessing the N requirements of each component in the mixture separately in order to correctly drive the performance of the whole system. The methods used to assess plant N nutrition status were initially developed for sole crops. In this review, i) we present different approaches adapted from these previous works to determine the N nutrition status of crops in intercrops; ii) we then compare the predictions of some of them, based on a European database of experimental results regarding cereal–grain legume and perennial grass–legume mixtures; and iii) we discuss the interests and limitations of current indices for mixed crops. We conclude that no single approach is currently valid to assess the N nutrition status of crops within the entire range of possible mixtures explored by farmers. However, some indices based on the N dilution theory perform well regarding the most common situations of balanced binary intercrops. Further research is now needed to properly address the cases of complex mixtures and severely shaded crops. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cereal-legume Mixture; Critical Dilution Curve; Diagnosis; Intercropping; Nitrogen Nutrition Index; Nitrogen Stress; Agricultural Ecosystem; Agricultural Management; Alternative Agriculture; Fertilizer Application; Food Product; Food Production; Intercropping; Legume; Fabaceae","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural management; alternative agriculture; fertilizer application; food product; food production; intercropping; legume; Fabaceae","","","The authors acknowledge the support received from the European Union through the H2020 ReMIX project (Redesigning European cropping systems based on species mixtures, https://www.remix-intercrops.eu/ ; Grant agreement ID: 727217 ) and from INRAE’s Environment and Agronomy Division through the INNI project (Individual Nitrogen Nutrition Indices).","Baldissera, Tiago Celso, Plant development controls leaf area expansion in alfalfa plants competing for light, Annals of Botany, 113, 1, pp. 145-157, (2014); Barillot, Romain, How good is the turbid medium-based approach for accounting for light partitioning in contrasted grasslegume intercropping systems?, Annals of Botany, 108, 6, pp. 1013-1024, (2011); Barillot, Romain, Assessing the effects of architectural variations on light partitioning within virtual wheat-pea mixtures, Annals of Botany, 114, 4, pp. 725-737, (2014); Barillot, Romain, Investigation of complex canopies with a functional-structural plant model as exemplified by leaf inclination effect on the functioning of pure and mixed stands of wheat during grain filling, Annals of Botany, 123, 4, pp. 727-742, (2019); Analyse De La Dynamique De Competition Pour La Lumiere Dans Les Associations Ble Dur Pois Dhiver Triticum Turgidum L Pisum Sativum L En Fonction De La Disponibilite En Azote, (2006); Bedoussac, Laurent, The efficiency of a durum wheat-winter pea intercrop to improve yield and wheat grain protein concentration depends on N availability during early growth, Plant and Soil, 330, 1, pp. 19-35, (2010); Bedoussac, Laurent, Dynamic analysis of competition and complementarity for light and N use to understand the yield and the protein content of a durum wheat-winter pea intercrop, Plant and Soil, 330, 1, pp. 37-54, (2010); Bedoussac, Laurent, Ecological principles underlying the increase of productivity achieved by cereal-grain legume intercrops in organic farming.

To determine this potential for different habitat types, it is crucial to understand habitat preferences and the habitat niche width of natural enemies. In addition, populations of natural enemies are affected by management practices depending on their preferences for habitat strata. Here we analysed agrobiont spider preferences (very common species in arable fields) for different microhabitats (ground, herbaceous, and shrub strata) and non-crop habitats (agroecosystems, forests, scrub, meadows, steppe, and wetlands). We compared guild-specific preferences of cursorial and web-building spiders that inhabit pome fruit orchards and cereal fields using two databases on Central European spider preferences. The majority of agrobiont spiders showed a moderate niche width. Agrobiont spiders from orchards preferred the shrub stratum while spiders from cereal fields preferred the ground and herbaceous strata across habitats. Agrobiont spiders primarily utilized non-crop habitats that were structurally similar to a particular agroecosystem: spiders from orchards utilized mostly woody vegetation while spiders from cereal fields utilized mostly meadows. Moreover, cursorial and web-building spider species from cereal fields differed in their preferences for different non-crop habitats. The results highlight that non-crop habitats have different potential as sources of agrobiont spiders. The composition of non-crop habitats in agricultural landscapes may affect the functional composition and pest control potential of spider communities. Further studies focusing on the effects that landscapes have on natural enemies in local agroecosystem need to account for the identity of non-crop habitats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crop; Functional Composition; Generalist; Landscape; Niche Filtering; Specialist; Agricultural Ecosystem; Agricultural Land; Cereal; Habitat Management; Niche Breadth; Pest Control; Spider; Araneae","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; cereal; habitat management; niche breadth; pest control; spider; Araneae","","","We thank all authors of the primary data and the creators of the databases.

CAMS-TEMPO includes temporal profiles for the priority air pollutants (NO<inf>x</inf>; SO<inf>x</inf>; NMVOC, non-methane volatile organic compound; NH<inf>3</inf>; CO; PM<inf>10</inf>; and PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and the greenhouse gases (CO<inf>2</inf>and CH<inf>4</inf>) for each of the following anthropogenic source categories: energy industry (power plants), residential combustion, manufacturing industry, transport (road traffic and air traffic in airports) and agricultural activities (fertilizer use and livestock). The profiles are computed on a global 0.1 × 0.1° and regional European 0.1 × 0.05° grid following the domain and sector classification descriptions of the global and regional emission inventories developed under the CAMS programme. The profiles account for the variability of the main emission drivers of each sector. Statistical information linked to emission variability (e.g. electricity production and traffic counts) at national and local levels were collected and combined with existing meteorology-dependent parametrizations to account for the influences of sociodemographic factors and climatological conditions. Depending on the sector and the temporal resolution (i.e. monthly, weekly, daily and hourly) the resulting profiles are pollutant-dependent, year-dependent (i.e. time series from 2010 to 2017) and/or spatially dependent (i.e. the temporal weights vary per country or region). We provide a complete description of the data and methods used to build the CAMS-TEMPO profiles, and whenever possible, we evaluate the representativeness of the proxies used to compute the temporal weights against existing observational data. We find important discrepancies when comparing the obtained temporal weights with other currently used datasets.

Mediterranean coastal lagoons have been historically altered, with their catchment being highly modified for agricultural, livestock, or urban uses. Changes in land uses induce pressures that impact the waterbodies and alter their ecological status. The objectives of this paper were: To develop a methodological approach (LUPLES: Land Uses for estimating Pressure Levels to approach the Ecological Status), to quantify the main pressures on the waterbodies and to forecast the possible impacts of these pressures on their ecological status. Corine-Land Cover maps and Geographic Information System technics were used to delineate and identify land uses in the catchments. Specific algorithms were created to quantify the main pressures from land uses in the catchment and hydro-morphological alterations in the immediate basin. The values of the estimated pressure levels were correlated with ecological status indicators using metrics developed for the European Water Framework Directive. Data were obtained from European and River Basin Authorities databases. Results showed statistically significant correlations between the pressure levels quantified by the LUPLES method and the impact level detected by biological, physical and chemical metrics. This method provides a useful approach to estimate the pressure levels affecting lentic waterbodies and could be applied to approach how they could affect their ecological status. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catchment Areas; Ecological Status; Gis Analysis; Mediterranean Coastal Lagoons; Water Framework Directive; Water Pollution","","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by the MINECO and the Agencia Estatal de Investigación of the Spanish Government through projects CLIMAWET (CGL2015‐69557‐R) and CLIMAWET‐CONS (PID2019‐104742RB‐I00), respectively, both cofounded by European FEDER Funds, one way to make Europe.

We propose a method for identifying periods of high forecast confidence using atmospheric circulation patterns, with an application to southern Australia precipitation. In particular, we use archetypal analysis to derive six patterns, called archetypes, of daily 500-hPa geopotential height (Z<inf>500</inf>) fields over Australia. We assign Z<inf>500</inf> reanalysis fields to the closest-matching archetype and subsequently link the archetypes to precipitation for three key regions in the Australian agriculture and energy sectors: the Murray Basin, southwest Western Australia, and western Tasmania. Using a 20-yr hindcast dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction system, we identify periods of high confidence as when hindcast Z<inf>500</inf> fields closely match an archetype according to a distance criterion. We compare the precipitation hindcast accuracy during these confident periods compared to normal. Considering all archetypes, we show that there is greater skill during confident periods for lead times of less than 10 days in the Murray Basin and western Tasmania, and for greater than 6 days in southwest Western Australia, although these conclusions are subject to substantial uncertainty. By breaking down the skill results for each archetype individually, we highlight how skill tends to be greater than normal for those archetypes associated with drier-than-average conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Australia; Clustering; Forecast Verification/skill; Probabilistic Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (pqpf); Seasonal Forecasting; Synoptic Climatology; Cluster Analysis; Forecasting Method; Precipitation Assessment; Prediction; Probability; Seasonal Variation; Australia; Tasmania","cluster analysis; forecasting method; precipitation assessment; prediction; probability; seasonal variation; Australia; Tasmania","","","Acknowledgments.

This involved a preliminary parameterization step of the dynamic factor describing the ageing of radiocesium in the root zone using a Bayesian approach. A data set with mid-term (10 years about) and long term (more than 20 years) field and literature data from 4 European countries was used. A double kinetics of the bioavailability decay was evidenced with two half-life periods equal to 0.46 ± 0.11 yr and 9.57 ± 1.12 yr for the fast and slow declining rates respectively. We, then, tested a few existing alternative models proposed in literature. The comparison with field data showed that these models always underestimated the observations by one to two orders of magnitude, suggesting that the solid-liquid partition coefficient (Kd) was overestimated by models. The results suggest that semi mechanistic models might fail in the long-term prediction of the radionuclide transfer from soil-to-plant in the food chain. They highlight the need to calculate Kd using easily exchangeable 137Cs (i.e. labile fraction) rather than total soil 137Cs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioavailability; Kinetics; Modeling; Radiocesium; Terrestrial Environments; Uncertainty; Cesium 137; Cesium; Cesium Radioisotopes; Cesium-137; Soil; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive; Transfer Factor; Agriculture; Bayesian Networks; Biochemistry; Bayesian Approaches; Exposure Assessment; Grass Transfer Factors; Long Term Observations; Long-term Prediction; Partition Coefficient; Radionuclide Transfer; Semi-mechanistic Models; Soils; Cesium 137; Radioisotope; Cesium; Cesium-137; Transfer Factor; Accuracy Assessment; Bayesian Analysis; Data Set; Food Chain; Grass; Long-term Change; Numerical Model; Parameterization; Article; Bayes Theorem; Bioavailability; Contamination; Ecosystem; Evaluation Study; France; Grazing; Kinetics; Liquid; Monte Carlo Method; Nonhuman; Partition Coefficient; Pasture; Plant; Prediction; Radioactivity; Soil; Solid; Uncertainty; Vegetation; Europe; Poaceae; Radiation Monitoring; Soil Pollutant; Bayes Theorem; Cesium Radioisotopes; Radiation Monitoring; Soil; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive; Transfer Factor","Agriculture; Bayesian networks; Biochemistry; Bayesian approaches; Exposure assessment; Grass Transfer factors; Long term observations; Long-term prediction; Partition coefficient; Radionuclide transfer; Semi-mechanistic models; Soils; cesium 137; radioisotope; cesium; Cesium-137; transfer factor; accuracy assessment; Bayesian analysis; data set; food chain; grass; long-term change; numerical model; parameterization; Article; Bayes theorem; bioavailability; contamination; ecosystem; evaluation study; France; grazing; kinetics; liquid; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; partition coefficient; pasture; plant; prediction; radioactivity; soil; solid; uncertainty; vegetation; Europe; Poaceae; radiation monitoring; soil pollutant; Bayes Theorem; Cesium Radioisotopes; Radiation Monitoring; Soil; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive; Transfer Factor","","cesium 137, 10045-97-3; cesium, 7440-46-2; Cesium Radioisotopes; Cesium-137; Soil; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive; Transfer Factor","This work was funded by Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IRSN) in France, MEMOREX project.

To measure the size of the bioeconomy in European Union (EU) countries, it is necessary to create appropriate indicators that allow it to be monitored with reference to its current state, growth rate and sector description. In many countries, including Poland, there is no complete information or data collection system to monitor bioeconomy development directly, e.g. in the Polish Central Statistical Office. In response to these needs, several groups of indicators related to the circular economy, sustainable development and Europe 2020 were created by the European Commission (EC) in the Eurostat database. These indicators can help monitoring of bioeconomy development in EU countries. The present study discusses factors for bioeconomy development through an analysis of their social, economic and environmental aspects, as well as showing the value of the selected indicators in the EU and Poland. In addition, a separate section is dedicated to public perception of bioeconomy and to legislation regarding genetically modified organisms (GMOs). To date, many research studies have been reported on the public acceptance of bioeconomy issues in the EU, including renewable resources, biofuels, GMOs, bio-based products, food security and climate change. The awareness and perception of society on the bioeconomy, bio-based products and processes, and the sustainable use of resources can contribute to environmental sustainability, but intensified efforts are required to increase public acceptance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bio-innovation; Bioeconomy; Biotechnology; Innovation; Natural Resources; Public Perception; Agricultural Robots; Climate Change; Food Supply; International Law; Service Industry; Complete Information; Data Collection System; Environmental Aspects; Environmental Sustainability; European Commission; European Union Countries; Genetically Modified Organisms; Statistical Offices; Bioeconomy; Biofuel; Article; Bioeconomy; Biotechnology; Climate Change; Economic Aspect; Environmental Factor; Environmental Indicator; Environmental Policy; Environmental Sustainability; European Union; Food Security; Human; Law; Poland; Priority Journal; Renewable Resource; Social Acceptance; Social Aspect; Sustainable Development; Transgenic Organism; Economic Development; Economics; Biotechnology; Economic Development","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Food supply; International law; Service industry; Complete information; Data collection system; Environmental aspects; Environmental sustainability; European Commission; European Union countries; Genetically modified organisms; Statistical Offices; Bioeconomy; biofuel; Article; bioeconomy; biotechnology; climate change; economic aspect; environmental factor; environmental indicator; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; European Union; food security; human; law; Poland; priority journal; renewable resource; social acceptance; social aspect; sustainable development; transgenic organism; economic development; economics; Biotechnology; Economic Development","","","This work was supported by grant from the National Science Centre, Poland ( 2014/15/B/NZ9/02312 ) and by funding from the ERANET-CORNET #22/2/2017 research project named “Innovative processing technology of rapeseed products for poultry nutrition” and was co-funded by the National Centre for Research and Development and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Poland .","Bioeconomy Development in Eu Regions, (2017); Innovating for Sustainable Growth A Bioeconomy for Europe, (2012); A Sustainable Bioeconomy for Europe Strengthening the Connection Between Economy Society and the Environment, (2018); Aguilar, Alfredo, Bioeconomy for Sustainable Development, Biotechnology Journal, 14, 8, (2019); Lokko, Yvonne, Biotechnology and the bioeconomy—Towards inclusive and sustainable industrial development, New Biotechnology, 40, pp. 5-10, (2018); McCormick, Kes B., The Bioeconomy in Europe: An Overview, Sustainability (Switzerland), 5, 6, pp. 2589-2608, (2013); Tyczewska, Agata, Towards Food Security: Current State and Future Prospects of Agrobiotechnology, Trends in Biotechnology, 36, 12, pp. 1219-1229, (2018); Brief on Jobs and Growth of the Bioeconomy 2009 2015, (2018); Closing the Loop an Eu Action Plan for the Circular Economy, (2015); Aguilar, Alfredo, Perspectives on bioeconomy, New Biotechnology, 40, pp. 181-184, (2018)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","18764347; 18716784","","","32835869","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089953756"

Speciated measurements were made with a low-volume denuder and filter pack method (DEnuder for Long-Term Atmospheric sampling, DELTA) as part of the EU NitroEurope (NEU) integrated project. Altogether, there were 64 sites in 20 countries (2006-2010), coordinated between seven European laboratories. Bulk wet-deposition measurements were carried out at 16 co-located sites (2008- 2010). Inter-comparisons of chemical analysis and DELTA measurements allowed an assessment of comparability between laboratories. The form and concentrations of the different gas and aerosol components measured varied between individual sites and grouped sites according to country, European regions, and four main ecosystem types (crops, grassland, forests, and semi-natural). The smallest concentrations (with the exception of SO<inf>2</inf>4 and NaC) were in northern Europe (Scandinavia), with broad elevations of all components across other regions. SO<inf>2</inf>concentrations were highest in central and eastern Europe, with larger SO<inf>2</inf>emissions, but particulate SO<inf>2</inf>4 concentrations were more homogeneous between regions. Gas-phase NH3 was the most abundant single measured component at the majority of sites, with the largest variability in concentrations across the network. The largest concentrations of NH3, NH<inf>C4</inf>, and NO<inf>3</inf>were at cropland sites in intensively managed agricultural areas (e.g. Borgo Cioffi in Italy), and the smallest were at remote semi-natural and forest sites (e.g. Lompolojankka, Finland), highlighting the potential for NH3 to drive the formation of both NH<inf>C4</inf>and NO<inf>3</inf>aerosol. In the aerosol phase, NH<inf>C4</inf>was highly corre-lated with both NO<inf>3</inf>and SO<inf>2</inf>4 , with a near-1 V 1 relationship between the equivalent concentrations of NH<inf>C4</inf>and sum (NO<inf>3</inf>C SO<inf>2</inf>4/, of which around 60% was as NH4NO<inf>3</inf>. Distinct seasonality was also observed in the data, influenced by changes in emissions, chemical interactions, and the influence of meteorology on partitioning between the main inorganic gases and aerosol species. Springtime maxima in NH3 were attributed to the main period of manure spreading, while the peak in summer and trough in winter were linked to the influence of temperature and rainfall on emissions, deposition, and gas-aerosol-phase equilibrium. Seasonality in SO<inf>2</inf>was mainly driven by emissions (combustion), with concentrations peaking in winter, except in southern Europe, where the peak occurred in summer. Particulate SO<inf>2</inf>4 showed large peaks in concentrations in summer in southern and eastern Europe, contrasting with much smaller peaks occurring in early spring in other regions. The peaks in particulate SO<inf>2</inf>4 coincided with peaks in NH3 concentrations, attributed to the formation of the stable (NH4/2SO4. HNO<inf>3</inf>concentrations were more complex, related to traffic and industrial emissions, photochemistry, and HNO<inf>3</inf>:NH4NO<inf>3</inf>partitioning. While HNO<inf>3</inf>concentrations were seen to peak in the summer in eastern and southern Europe (increased photochemistry), the absence of a spring peak in HNO<inf>3</inf>in all regions may be explained by the depletion of HNO<inf>3</inf>through reaction with surplus NH3 to form the semi-volatile aerosol NH4NO<inf>3</inf>. Cooler, wetter conditions in early spring favour the formation and persistence of NH4NO<inf>3</inf>in the aerosol phase, consistent with the higher springtime concentrations of NH<inf>C4</inf>and NO<inf>3</inf>. The seasonal profile of NO<inf>3</inf>was mirrored by NH<inf>C4</inf>, illustrating the influence of gas-aerosol partitioning of NH4NO<inf>3</inf>in the seasonality of these components. Gas-phase NH3 and aerosol NH4NO<inf>3</inf>were the dominant species in the total inorganic gas and aerosol species measured in the NEU network. With the current and projected trends in SO<inf>2</inf>, NOx , and NH3 emissions, concentrations of NH3 and NH4NO<inf>3</inf>can be expected to continue to dominate the inorganic pollution load over the next decades, especially NH3, which is linked to substantial exceedances of ecological thresholds across Europe. The shift from (NH4/2SO4 to an atmosphere more abundant in NH4NO<inf>3</inf>is expected to maintain a larger fraction of reactive N in the gas phase by partitioning to NH3 and HNO<inf>3</inf>in warm weather, while NH4NO<inf>3</inf>continues to contribute to exceedances of air quality limits for PM2:5. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerosol Composition; Aerosol Formation; Air Quality; Atmospheric Pollution; Concentration (composition); Data Set; Environmental Assessment; Particulate Matter; Europe","aerosol composition; aerosol formation; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); data set; environmental assessment; particulate matter; Europe","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements.

Despite the importance of animal welfare, many such frameworks fail to adequately take account of it, mostly due to difficulties in accessing suitable data. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to develop indicators of animal welfare that can be embedded within a wider sustainability framework using a representative farm-level dataset such as the European Union (EU) Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) for Ireland, the Teagasc National Farm Survey. The paper presents a set of sustainability indicators for dairy farms in Ireland for the 2014–2017 period and examines the impact of policy reform on sustainability performance. Headline results show that welfare standards on dairy farms in Ireland have remained stable over the period despite the considerable intensification of the dairy sector following EU milk quota removal. Furthermore, dairy farms that have expanded herd size significantly have improved welfare standards more than farms that have not increased production. An analysis of synergies and trade-offs between the various aspects of sustainability reveals that positive correlations exist between welfare standards and economic and environmental performance. The analysis facilitates the identification of win-win farm-level strategies that can be adopted to improve economic, environmental and animal welfare outcomes. The framework developed here presents opportunities for evaluating policy impacts at the farm level on various aspects of sustainability. The use of the FADN demonstrates the capacity to extend such an approach across the EU. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Sustainability; Composite Welfare Indicator; Dairy Cow Welfare; Dairy Farm Expansion; Social Sustainability","","","","","Options Mediterraneennes A, (2011); Arnott, Gareth A., Review: welfare of dairy cows in continuously housed and pasture-based production systems, Animal, 11, 2, pp. 261-273, (2017); Barnes, Andrew Peter, The effect of lameness prevalence on technical efficiency at the dairy farm level: An adjusted data envelopment analysis approach, Journal of Dairy Science, 94, 11, pp. 5449-5457, (2011); Battini, M., Invited review: Animal-based indicators for on-farm welfare assessment for dairy goats, Journal of Dairy Science, 97, 11, pp. 6625-6648, (2014); Bertocchi, Luigi, Characterization of hazards, welfare promoters and animal-based measures for the welfare assessment of dairy cows: Elicitation of expert opinion, Preventive Veterinary Medicine, 150, pp. 8-18, (2018); Blokhuis, Harry J., The welfare quality® project and beyond: Safeguarding farm animal well-being, Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica - Section A: Animal Science, 60, 3, pp. 129-140, (2010); Bonisoli, Lorenzo, Benchmarking agri-food sustainability certifications: Evidences from applying SAFA in the Ecuadorian banana agri-system, Journal of Cleaner Production, 236, (2019); Boyle, Laura Ann, The effect of rubber versus concrete passageways in cubicle housing on claw health and reproduction of pluriparous dairy cows, Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 106, 1-3, pp. 1-12, (2007); Brennan, Mary, Towards a better measurement of the social sustainability of Irish agriculture, International Journal of Sustainable Development, 23, 3-4, pp. 263-287, (2020); Brouwer, Henriëtte, The validity of a monitoring system based on routinely collected dairy cattle health data relative to a standardized herd check, Preventive Veterinary Medicine, 122, 1-2, pp. 76-82, (2015)","","Compuscript Ltd","","","","","","07916833","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141719796"

It introduced a water pricing policy in the agricultural sector that is based on a 'polluter-pays' principle. To date, some Member States have yet to comply with the pricing requirement for two main reasons: water cost estimates, as defined by the wfd , are particularly complex and difficult in the agricultural sector and farmers in marginal economic and environmental contexts may be unable to bear higher water costs. In Italy, water services are managed by regional administrations that also set irrigation water prices. This research estimated the effect of changes in irrigation water costs borne by farmers on farm incomes in a case study in the Aosta Valley Region where extensive farming is practice in a significantly naturallydisadvantage area. The analysis was modeled using four cost scenarios with economic data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (fadn ) integrated with irrigation water cost data provided by a regional administrative database. Estimated water costs averaged 2.65% and 1.06% of farm incomes, depending on the presence or absence of regional subsidies. Water costs represented higher income proportions on specialized grazing livestock farms, which is the predominant type of farming in Aosta Valley. These results raise concerns for wfd implementation, in particular, in mountain and agriculturallydisadvantaged areas with extensive and less-profitable farming. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Network; Directive; Farm Accountancy; Farm Income; Irrigation; Water Framework","","","","","Le Aziende Agricole in Italia Rapporto Rica 2020, (2020); Battaglini, Luca Maria, Environmental sustainability of Alpine livestock farms, Italian Journal of Animal Science, 13, 2, pp. 431-443, (2014); Bazzani, Guido Maria, Irrigated agriculture in Italy and water regulation under the European Union water framework directive, Water Resources Research, 40, 7, pp. W07-S048, (2004); Bazzani, Guido Maria, The sustainability of irrigated agricultural systems under the Water Framework Directive: First results, Environmental Modelling and Software, 20, 2, pp. 165-175, (2005); Italian Agriculture in the Context of Climate Change the Role of Irrigation for Sustainable Development of Rural Areas, (2007); Pricing Policies for Enhancing the Sustainability of Water Resources, (2000); Introduction to the Eu Water Framework Directive, (2019); Commission Staff Working Document, (2019); Data Management for the Assessment of Rdp Effects, (2020); Farm Accounting Data Network Fadn an A to Z of Methodology, (2018)","","FrancoAngeli","","","","","","11261668; 19724802","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127098111"

In order to gain a detailed insight into this process, the paper will analyse the forest databases of the European satellite monitoring program Copernicus. This program, among other things, monitors the condition of forests in 39 European countries by using the High Resolution Layer (HRL). The HRL Forests database consists of 3 types of (status) products, and additional change products. The status products are available for the reference years 2012, 2015, and 2018. The status layers provide information on the Dominant Leaf Type and the Tree Cover Density at pixel level for the reference year 2018 in 10 m resolution. The Forest Type layer largely follows the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) forest definition. Also, the paper will use the data on forests from the CORINE Land Cover project for 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018. The time-series includes a land change layer, highlighting changes in land cover and land use. The CLC Changes database will be analysed separately for three periods: 2000-2006, 2006-2012 and 2012-2018, due to more accurate data on forest losses. The results of the research show that forests in Bosnia and Herzegovina were reduced by 2.95%, in the period 2012-2018, where 2.55% of them were coniferous.

The goal of our project is to support agroecology in terms of carbon farming and biodiversity protection by providing an AI and data streaming platform called Gaia-AgStream that accelerates the adoption of AI in agriculture and is directly usable by farmers as well as agricultural companies in general. The technical innovations we propose focus on smart sensor networks, unified uncertainty management, explainable AI, root cause analysis and hybrid AI approaches. Our AI and data streaming platform concept contributes to the European open data infrastructure project Gaia-X in terms of interoperability for data and AI models as well as data sovereignty and AI infrastructure. Our envisioned platform and the developed AI components for carbon farming and biodiversity will enable farmers to adopt sustainable and resilient production methods while establishing new and diverse revenue streams by monetizing carbon sequestration and AI ready data streams. The open and federated platform concept allows to bring together research, industry, agricultural start-ups and farmers in order to form sustainable innovation networks. We describe core concepts and architecture of our proposed approach in these contexts, outline practical use cases for our platform and finally outline challenges and future prospects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agroecology; Anomaly Detection; Biodiversity; Carbon Farming; Complex Networks; Data Fusion; Data Quality; Distributed Systems; Explainable Ai; Knowledge Graph; Machine Learning; Root Cause Analysis; Sensor Networks; Uncertainty Management; Agriculture; Anomaly Detection; Biodiversity; Complex Networks; Data Integration; Data Reduction; Information Management; Knowledge Graph; Open Data; Quality Control; Semantic Web; Sensor Data Fusion; Sensor Networks; Uncertainty Analysis; Agro Ecologies; Carbon Farming; Data Quality; Data Streaming; Explainable Artificial Intelligence; Knowledge Graphs; Root Cause Analysis; Sensors Network; Uncertainty Management; Machine Learning","Agriculture; Anomaly detection; Biodiversity; Complex networks; Data integration; Data reduction; Information management; Knowledge graph; Open Data; Quality control; Semantic Web; Sensor data fusion; Sensor networks; Uncertainty analysis; Agro ecologies; Carbon farming; Data quality; Data streaming; Explainable artificial intelligence; Knowledge graphs; Root cause analysis; Sensors network; Uncertainty management; Machine learning","","","","Abele, Lisa, Combining knowledge modeling and machine learning for alarm root cause analysis, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 46, 9, pp. 1843-1848, (2013); Akyìldìz, Ian Fuat, Wireless sensor networks: A survey, Computer Networks, 38, 4, pp. 393-422, (2002); Barredo-Arrieta, Alejandro, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, Information Fusion, 58, pp. 82-115, (2020); Data Science Analytics and Applications, (2017); Atzmueller, Martin, Explanation-aware feature selection using symbolic time series abstraction: Approaches and experiences in a petro-chemical production context, pp. 799-804, (2017); Big Data Analytics for Proactive Industrial Decision Support, (2016); Enterprise Big Data Engineering Analytics and Management, (2016); Atzmueller, Martin, The mining and analysis continuum of explaining uncovered, pp. 273-278, (2011); undefined; Bloemheuvel, Stefan D., Graph Summarization for Computational Sensemaking on Complex Industrial Event Logs, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 362 LNBIP, pp. 417-429, (2019)","Boumerdassi, S.; Ghogho, M.; Renault, E.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","1st International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Agriculture, SSA 2021","","Virtual, Online","268539","18650937; 18650929","9789819671748; 9789819664610; 9783032026743; 9783032008831; 9783032026712; 9789819671779; 9783031949425; 9789819666874; 9783031936968; 9783031941207","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119875445"

Consequently, there is less and less agricultural land. Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the countries whose population is decreasing from year to year, partly owing to negative natural increase and partly owing to the migrations of young people to developed western countries. However, despite the depopulation trend, there has been a significant decline in agricultural land in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. The reasons should be sought in various socio-economic processes that crucially affect spatial development. In order to understand the changes that are happening in the field, the paper analyzes the structure of agricultural land losses in B&H based on the database of the European project CORINE Land Cover. In relation to the five main land cover categories (artificial surfaces, agricultural areas, forests and semi-natural areas, wetlands and water bodies), the data show that in the period from 2000 to 2018 artificial areas increased spatial coverage, forests and semi-natural areas as well, while agricultural land decreased. The aim of the research is to identify the spatially largest changes of agricultural land subclasses into other types of land cover, in order to determine the causes and areas with the most intense pressure. This is essential given the fact that agricultural land is becoming an increasingly important natural resource over time. Based on the recent demographic and socio-economic trends, it is to be expected that the trend of decreasing agricultural land will continue in the future, but with a reduced intensity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Land; B&h; Cha; Clc; Database; Losses","","","","","Census of Population Households and Dwellings in Bosnia and Herzegovina 2013, (2016); Corine Land Cover Clc 2018, (2019); Drašković, Branislav, Land cover types and changes in land use in republic of srpska (Bosnia and Herzegovina) over the period 2000–2018, Journal of the Geographical Institute Jovan Cvijic SASA, 70, 1, pp. 81-88, (2020); Journal Geographical Review, (2020); Corine Land Cover Nomenclature Guidelines, (2019); Clc 2018 B H Final Report Information, (2018); Bosnia and Herzegovina Land Cover Country Fact Sheet 2012, (2017); State of the World S Forests 2016, (2016); Thematic Bulletins Population and Register, (2020); Agriculture and Forestry, (2018)","","University of Montenegro","","","","","","18009492; 05545579","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104336270"

This paper assesses user involvement in a diverse set of European Union (EU)-funded and non-EU (formal and informal) multi-actor partnerships. Design/methodology/approach: A review of 200 projects and other partnerships including farmers and foresters, drawn from an integrated database of several thousand such examples, assessed the types of innovation challenges tackled, solutions proposed, innovation supported, parameters of actor participation and the expectations of success in each example. Findings: All the reviewed policy instruments, not just those funded in the frame of the EIP-AGRI, can be used to involve users in co-innovation in agriculture, forestry and related value chains. Practical implications: The EIP-AGRI is just one part of a complex matrix of multi-actor co-innovation activities involving farmers and foresters in Europe. Interlinking of innovation programmes and more effective targeting of these programmes at groups of actors, especially users, who are currently not sufficiently engaged are worthy aspirations. Theoretical implications: Any analysis of co-innovation involving users must recognise the existence of a multiplicity (projects, non-project activities, formal and informal) of multi-actor approaches. Originality/value: This research used a common methodology to review several forms of multi-actor partnerships involving users and other actors. Our data suggest that many of these are effective methods of supporting co-innovation and are, therefore, ‘sharing the space’ within the AKIS. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Co-innovation; Eip-agri; Forestry; Liaison Project; Policy Interventions","","","","This work was conducted within the LIAISON project.

Assessing workplace injury risk factors associated with farming is challenged by non-collection, non-reporting, or under-reporting by farmers, particularly those operating family farms in a self-employed manner. A supplementary (or add-on) farm operator (FO) workplace injury survey was undertaken in association with the Irish National Farm Survey (NFS), which is responsible for provision of Irish farm-level data to the European Commission (EC) Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). Data from this add-on survey were analyzed in association with farm and socio-economic data routinely collected by NFS as a component of the FADN. The combined data-set was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques including multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for occurrence of farm operator workplace injuries (FOWI). FOWI levels were significantly higher on farms where both the FO and their spouse engaged in Off Farm Employment (OFE). More generally, FO injury levels were associated with farm workload and investment levels. The study demonstrates how FADN farm and socio-economic data can be combined with additional FO workplace injury data to identify workplace injury risk factors. The study identifies a risk factor for FOWI occurrence where both FO and spouse engaged in OFE. More generally, it indicates that farm workplace injuries are associated with farm management-related factors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Farm Management; Farm Workplace Injury; Occupational Safety And Health (osh); Risk Factor; Agricultural Land; Agricultural Worker; Agriculture; Epidemiology; Human; Ireland; Risk Factor; Workplace; Agriculture; Farmers; Farms; Humans; Risk Factors; Workplace","agricultural land; agricultural worker; agriculture; epidemiology; human; Ireland; risk factor; workplace; Agriculture; Farmers; Farms; Humans; Risk Factors; Workplace","","","This study was completed by collaboration among the authors.

However, information about existing LTFEs is scattered, and the research data are not easily accessible. In this study, meta-information on LTFEs in Germany is compiled and their spatial representation is analyzed. The study is conducted within the framework of the BonaRes project, which, inter alia, has established a central access point for LTFE information and research data. A total of 205 LTFEs which fit to the definition above are identified. Of these, 140 LTFEs are ongoing. The land use in 168 LTFEs is arable field crops, in 34 trials grassland, in 2 trials vegetables and in 1 trial pomiculture. Field crop LTFEs are categorized into fertilization (n = 158), tillage (n = 38) and crop rotation (n = 32; multiple nominations possible) experiments, while all grassland experiments (n = 34) deal with fertilization. The spatial representation is analyzed according to the climatic water balance of the growing season (1 May to 31 October) (CWBg), the Müncheberg Soil Quality Rating (MSQR) and clay content. The results show that, in general, the LTFEs well represent the area shares of both the CWBg and the MSQR classes. Eighty-nine percent of the arable land and 65% of the grassland in Germany are covered by the three driest CWBg classes, hosting 89% and 71% of the arable and grassland LTFEs, respectively. LTFEs cover all six MSQR classes but with a bias towards the high and very high soil quality classes. LTFEs on arable land are present in all clay content classes according to the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) but with a bias towards the clay content class 4. Grassland LTFEs show a bias towards the clay content classes 5, 6 and 7, while well representing the other clay content classes, except clay content class 3, where grassland LTFEs are completely missing. The results confirm the very high potential of LTFE data for spatially differentiated analyses and modeling. However, reuse is restricted by the difficult access to LTFE research data. The common database is an important step in overcoming this restriction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Experimental Design; Field Method; Image Classification; Spatial Analysis; Germany","experimental design; field method; image classification; spatial analysis; Germany","","","Funding text 1: tioned. In addition, the heterogeneous setup and the scattered distribution of LTFEs make comparisons of data difficult or impossible (Bai, 2018). To cope with these problems, in the frame of the project “BonaRes”, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), there is a focus on a central database for metadata and research data from LTFEs (BonaRes, 2020). The research data from two LTFEs (V140, Müncheberg and Dikopshof, Bonn) are available for free reuse via the BonaRes data portal (https://maps.bonares.de/mapapps/, last access: 20 November 2020) and the research data of nine other LTFEs are very close to publication.

A sector of the economy where the implications of the credit crunch have not been thoroughly studied is the agriculture. This is surprising given the importance of agriculture for the European economy. We focus on agriculture in fourteen European Union (EU) Member States in the aftermath of the credit crunch. To this end, we employ the micro-econometric data set of Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) of EU at NUTS 2 level. From a methodological point of view, we model agriculture investment based on a flexible panel Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model that provides impulse response functions (IRFs) and variance decompositions (VDCs). The empirical estimates indicate that agriculture investment has been constrained by negative shocks in interest paid and total liabilities. Unless those financial constraints are eased, agriculture investment in EU would remain rather sluggish at best. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Crunch; Endogeneity; Eu Agriculture Investment; Panel Var; Credit Provision; European Union; Financial Market; Financial Services; Investment; Panel Data; Europe","credit provision; European Union; financial market; financial services; investment; panel data; Europe","","","","Credit Growth and Economic Recovery in Europe After the Global Financial Crisis, (2017); Bataa, Erdenebat, Changes in the relationship between short-term interest rate, inflation and growth: evidence from the UK, 1820–2014, Bulletin of Economic Research, 71, 4, pp. 616-640, (2019); Benjamin, Catherine, Does capital market structure affect farm investment?

As its origin story and initial encounter, Central Asia offers a prismatic lens to delve into the vital impacts and significant changes wrought by the BRI. In the dryland region, the BRI impact on watersheds and agriculture is a critical challenge with direct implications for food security. Framed by diverse research sources, we utilized spatial datasets from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative and the World Bank to explore the intersection of food production, water and development. Investigation evaluates the possible trade-offs that Chinese infrastructure investment can have on the communities and environment of Central Asia. The findings identify more than 15,000 km of rail and 20,000 km of roads linked to the BRI crisscrossing the region in 2018. Whilst these transport corridors have improved connectivity, many of these rails and roads traverse important agricultural and water zones, creating undetermined risks and opportunities. Land use change was examined within a 10-km buffer around BRI roads and rails from 2008 to 2018. Railways increased by 23% during this time, yet irrigated and rainfed agriculture decreased whilst urban areas markedly expanded. Contextual research identifies how Chinese policies may encourage agribusiness investment for food exports as possible disruptions to national and regional food supply. However, to date Central Asia provides <1% of Chinese agricultural imports. In fact, Afghanistan is the region’s dominant export market, tripling agricultural imports >300% in this time. Similarly, five times more livestock are traded within the region than to China. Evaluating infrastructure change is essential to understand BRI impacts on environments and societies, with the food-water nexus a particular concern in Central Asia. Limited Chinese imports of Central Asian agriculture suggests the region’s food security will not be significantly altered by the Belt and Road Initiative. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Belt And Road Initiative (bri); Central Asia; Food Security; Water-food Nexus; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Climate Change; Commerce; Economic And Social Effects; Food Supply; Land Use; Roads And Streets; Contextual Research; Critical Challenges; European Space Agency; Food Production; Infrastructure Investment; Rain Fed Agriculture; Spatial Datasets; Transport Corridors; Investments; Agricultural Production; Food Security; Food Supply; Import; Infrastructural Development; Road Construction; Trade-off; Urban Area; Watershed; Afghanistan; China","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate change; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Land use; Roads and streets; Contextual research; Critical challenges; European Space Agency; Food production; Infrastructure investment; Rain fed agriculture; Spatial datasets; Transport corridors; Investments; agricultural production; food security; food supply; import; infrastructural development; road construction; trade-off; urban area; watershed; Afghanistan; China","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers (JP) 19H04362 (Risk assessment of the regional impact of the China \u201COne-Belt-One-Road\u201D (OBOR) project) and the UK\u2019s Economic and Social Research Council and Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) Grant Ref: ES/S000798/1.

This parameter is represented in the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its successor (RUSLE), by the respective component (K-factor). Its accurate quantification is critical for modelling soil erosion. Yet, in many countries – Greece included – the process is hindered by the lack of high-quality field observations, evenly distributed in time and space. In light of the above, the study aims to develop the new soil erodibility map of Greece. The K-factor was calculated using the algebraic expression of the Wischmeier and Smith (1978) nomograph. The latter considers basic soil properties like granulometry, soil organic matter content, structure and permeability. Approximately 2800 soil samples were utilized, deriving from the European Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) and the Greek National Agricultural Research Foundation (NAGREF) databases. Of them, 577 corresponded to croplands and 2113 to forests/rangeland. Erodibility was spatially interpolated utilizing the ordinary cokriging methodology. The mean nationwide value was estimated at 0.024 t ha h ha−1 MJ−1 mm−1, ranging from 0.013−0.044 t ha h ha−1 MJ−1 mm−1. After incorporating the surface stone cover effect, given the country's extensive coverage, mean K-factor value was reduced by 22 %, at 0.018 t ha h ha–1 MJ–1 mm–1. The new maps (500 m resolution) improve the accuracy of the available K-factor delineation, developed by the EU at pan-European level. The sample network is denser (1 sample per 48 km2) and more evenly distributed throughout the Greek territory. Also, the geostatistical model was fitted focusing entirely on the specific attributes of Greece. The results were proportional to those yielded by national and international studies of local and national interest. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","K-factor; Rusle; Soil Erodibility Factor; Agricultural Robots; Erosion; Land Use; Sediment Transport; Accurate Quantifications; Agricultural Research; Algebraic Expression; Geostatistical Modeling; International Studies; Ordinary Co-kriging; Soil Organic Matter Contents; Universal Soil Loss Equation; Soils; Erodibility; European Union; Geostatistics; Numerical Model; Soil Erosion; Soil Organic Matter; Universal Soil Loss Equation; Vulnerability; Greece","Agricultural robots; Erosion; Land use; Sediment transport; Accurate quantifications; Agricultural research; Algebraic expression; Geostatistical modeling; International studies; Ordinary co-kriging; Soil organic matter contents; Universal soil loss equation; Soils; erodibility; European Union; geostatistics; numerical model; soil erosion; soil organic matter; Universal Soil Loss Equation; vulnerability; Greece","","","The author wishes to thank the EU and the Greek NAGREF for the provision of the soil samples data.

In response, the German federal state of Saxony combined the instrument of management plans with AEPs to support the implementation of the Habitat Directive. In this study, we investigate the determinants of a farmers’ decisions to adjust their farming practices. Our data set consists of a quantitative survey with 131 farmers conducted between 2004 and 2011, complemented by implementation data from 333 grassland-plots. Determinants of farmers’ decisions to conserve grassland were estimated using a multinomial logit model. Our results show that a combination of management plans and AEPs can increase farmers’ disposition to adopt nature conservation measures. As central determinants, structural and location factors as well as the complementary provisiion of specifically designed AEPs increase farmers’ willingness to adopt conservation practices for grassland management. It can be concluded that additional costs are a major barrier to farmers’ adoption, particularly to those farms directing their farm management towards the optimisation of productivity and profitability .

Tall tower based monitoring stations are relatively rare, but provide important information about the carbon balance of a larger region surrounding the tower. In this study we report and analyze the 21-year-long dataset provided by the Hungarian tall tower site, Hegyhátsál. The daily and annual cycles of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production, and total ecosystem respiration are presented. Footprint analysis reveals that the fluxes mostly originate from the surrounding arable lands; the main source region is located within 1 km around the tower. Long-term, mean NEE was -0.467 gC m-2 day-1, or -170 gC m-2 year-1, revealing that the complex region was a net carbon sink from the atmospheric perspective. Trend analysis indicates that overall, NEE decreased (i.e. became more negative, which means stronger sink) by 12 gC m-2 year-1, a trend that is explained by improved agrotechnology and climate change. Net biome production (NBP) was estimated using crop census data and assumptions about the management practices that affect lateral carbon flux. Long term mean NBP was -30 gC m-2 year-1, which indicates that the soils may be losing carbon, though this loss is within the range of uncertainty of the measurements (~50 gC m-2 year-1). Analysis of county-scale yield statistics suggested that the results can be representative to at least county scale (1651 km2). Interannual variability was analyzed by using environmental variables such as maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure deficit, soil water content, and satellite based vegetation index aggregated at monthly and longer time intervals. The results indicate that environmental conditions in spring have a major role in the annual carbon balance. Moreover, water availability represented by soil water content rather than by precipitation is a major driver of the interannual variability of NEE. The statistical analysis suggested that the large positive NEE anomaly during 2001–2003 was caused by interplay among the environmental drivers, in particular maximum temperature, vapor pressure deficit and radiation in April, followed by a soil water content deficit during the growing season.

It has a direct impact on agriculture and its domestic and international supply chain linkages. As one of the largest agricultural producers in the world, the European Union (EU) is particularly sensitive to changes in water availability. Therefore, we perform a structural decomposition analysis based on the recently released EXIOBASE 3 database to examine in depth how changes in water input coefficients, in final demand and in technology have affected changes in water use across crops. Crop production consumes 99% of the direct water in agriculture. Our results show that the largest EU crop producers have experienced an increase in water use that is mostly driven by changes in technology. On the other hand, several Mediterranean countries, where water scarcity has been a problem for years, have decreased their water consumption mostly thanks to an improvement in their water intensity. Results by crop are consistent with those at the aggregated level except for vegetables of which water use changes have been primarily driven by changes in final demand and water intensity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Water; Water; Agricultural Robots; Climate Change; Crops; Cultivation; Population Statistics; Supply Chains; Agricultural Sector; Crop Production; International Supply Chains; Mediterranean Countries; Population Growth; Structural Decomposition Analysis; Water Availability; Water Consumption; Water Supply; Climate Change; European Union; Population Growth; Sustainability; Uncertainty Analysis; Water Management; Water Resource; Water Use; Agriculture; Analysis; Article; Cereal; Constants And Coefficients; Crop; Crop Management; Crop Production; Data Base; Environmental Parameters; Fluid Intake; Fruit; Irrigation (agriculture); Nut; Oilseed; Southern Europe; Structural Decomposition Analysis; Technology; Tillage; Vegetable; Water Availability; Water Deficit; Water Input Coefficient; Water Intensity; Water Supply; Wheat; Water; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Water; Water Supply","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Population statistics; Supply chains; Agricultural sector; Crop production; International supply chains; Mediterranean countries; Population growth; Structural decomposition analysis; Water availability; Water consumption; Water supply; climate change; European Union; population growth; sustainability; uncertainty analysis; water management; water resource; water use; agriculture; analysis; Article; cereal; constants and coefficients; crop; crop management; crop production; data base; environmental parameters; fluid intake; fruit; irrigation (agriculture); nut; oilseed; Southern Europe; structural decomposition analysis; technology; tillage; vegetable; water availability; water deficit; water input coefficient; water intensity; water supply; wheat; water; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Water; Water Supply","","water, 7732-18-5; Water","","Feng, Kuishuang, A multi-region input-output analysis of global virtual water flows, pp. 225-246, (2015); Antle, John M., Climate impacts on agriculture: Insights from agronomic-economic analysis, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, 11, 2, pp. 299-318, (2017); Olmstead, Sheila M., The economics of managing scarce water resources, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, 4, 2, pp. 179-198, (2010); Priorities for Water Resources Allocation and Management, (1993); Allan, John Anthony Tony, Virtual water: A strategic resource global solutions to regional deficits, Ground Water, 36, 4, pp. 545-546, (1998); Hoekstra, Arjen Y., The global dimension of water governance: Why the river basin approach is no longer sufficient and why cooperative action at global level is needed, Water (Switzerland), 3, 1, pp. 21-46, (2011); Dalin, Carole, Evolution of the global virtual water trade network, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 109, 16, pp. 5989-5994, (2012); Wan, Liyang, Impacts on quality-induced water scarcity: Drivers of nitrogen-related water pollution transfer under globalization from 1995 to 2009, Environmental Research Letters, 11, 7, (2016); Qian, Yiying, Water footprint characteristic of less developed water-rich regions: Case of Yunnan, China, Water Research, 141, pp. 208-216, (2018); Mekonnen, Mesfin M., A global and high-resolution assessment of the green, blue and grey water footprint of wheat, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 14, 7, pp. 1259-1276, (2010)","","American Chemical Society service@acs.org","","","","","","0013936X; 15205851","","ESTHA","32609504","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089609573"

However, it still faces challenges in terms of its application. This research responds to the need for integrating a geographical information system (GIS) tool into the tLCA framework, which has not yet been operationalised in the framework. This article aims to contribute to harmonising the link between tLCA and GIS at the inventory phase. In specific, we propose to introduce the concept of “territorial Emission Factor (tEF)” in the inventory phase of the current tLCA framework so that emissions can be calculated directly from land-use planning, which can be expressed as spatial data using GIS. A case study of maize land use in the Walloon region (South region in Belgium) is implemented to prove the concept for agricultural territories. Besides the benefit of linking GIS in tLCA, the results show that tEF can serve as an informative indicator, revealing territorial differences and identify hotspots in input inventory. The case study calculates tEF at the subnational level using open-access data, which shows one possibility to discriminate tEF for European countries. The data selection for the case study is mainly based on an analysis of the methods and data sources used in the existing life cycle inventory databases for the agricultural sector. This practice contributes to increasing transparency and comparability of the results. It reveals a possibility to fill the data gap with existing open-access data when the inventory for the agricultural territory at subnational is not available. In sum, this study 1) develops the concept of tEF to facilitate tLCA operationalisation with GIS 2) conducts a case study to demonstrate the utilisation of tEF in tLCA, and 3) explores the possibility of discriminating tEF over European countries for agricultural sector through open-access data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Territory; Gis; Inventory Data Estimation; Territorial Emission Factor; Territorial Lca; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Land Use; Life Cycle; Open Data; Agricultural Land Use; Agricultural Sector; European Countries; Its Applications; Land Use Planning; Life Cycle Assessment (lca); Life Cycle Inventory; Life Cycle Inventory Database; Geographic Information Systems","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Land use; Life cycle; Open Data; Agricultural land use; Agricultural sector; European Countries; ITS applications; Land Use Planning; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Life cycle inventory database; Geographic information systems","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This work was supported by the Fund for Scientific Research (F.R.S.-FNRS) (grant number: F.4517.17).; Funding text 2: Funding: This work was supported by the Fund for Scientific Research (F.R.S.-FNRS) (grant number: F.4517.17 ).","Achten, Wouter M.J., EU-Average Impacts of Wheat Production: A Meta-Analysis of Life Cycle Assessments, Journal of Industrial Ecology, 20, 1, pp. 132-144, (2016); Bulle, Cécile S.M., IMPACT World+: a globally regionalized life cycle impact assessment method, International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 24, 9, pp. 1653-1674, (2019); Carlsson, Raul, LCI data modelling and a database design, International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 3, 2, pp. 106-113, (1998); Agri Footprint 4 0 Part 2 Description of Data, (2017); Regions in the European Union Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics Nuts 2010 Eu 27, (2015); Guiomar, Nuno, Typology and distribution of small farms in Europe: Towards a better picture, Land Use Policy, 75, pp. 784-798, (2018); Territorial Planning System and the Urban Development in Belgium from A Deterministic to A Strategic Model, (2011); Hellweg, S., Emerging approaches, challenges and opportunities in life cycle assessment, Science, 344, 6188, pp. 1109-1113, (2014); Helming, Katharina, Ex ante impact assessment of policies affecting land use, Part A: Analytical framework, Ecology and Society, 16, 1, (2011); Hiloidhari, Moonmoon, Emerging role of Geographical Information System (GIS), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and spatial LCA (GIS-LCA) in sustainable bioenergy planning, Bioresource Technology, 242, pp. 218-226, (2017)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083323964"

Information and data used are obtained from the European Commission database. The methodology includes the min–max approach and multivariate techniques, namely, Cluster and Factorial Analysis. The findings show the existence of three different clusters of farms in European countries, namely, Central European countries, New Eastern Member States, and the Mediterranean countries. The results also conclude that European agriculture and their respective farms have moderate sustainability where the subsidies from Common Agricultural Policy have a positive impact on. Moreover, agricultural activity in the European Central countries presents the highest value in economic contribution, whereas the Mediterranean countries present more contribution in environmental terms. The highest contribution in terms of creating rural jobs is found in Eastern countries. The main conclusion highlights the need to better adjust agricultural policies among the European Member States in order to better promote the sustainability of agriculture in Europe. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Cluster Analysis; Europe; Farms; Min–max; Sustainability","","","","The authors would like to extend their gratitude to the King Saud University and the Chief Editor for providing this publication opportunity by granting financial assistance and making this manuscript available as open access.

However, the concept is not yet fully integrated into actual planning strategies, in this respect the Czech Republic is no different. A major problem in doing so is a lack of guidelines/ how to identify and map GI using available sources and thus keeping costs down. The existing data sources for land cover or land use often do not fulfil the requirements in terms of thematic coverage, resolution or accuracy. In order to work around such limitations, we analyse the existing land use/land cover data in the Czech Republic from the GI perspective. Furthermore, we propose a GI mapping methodology based on the diagnosis of three mapping approaches at the regional level, grounded on the utilisation and processing of different data sets. We compared GI maps based on European data from CORINE Land Cover Database, Czech national database called Consolidated Layer of Ecosystems (CLE) and combination of Czech national and regional data and manual vectorization. Our results show that CORINE based GI map is suitable for transnational scale but unsuitable for regional scale. The CLE based GI map is good for both national and regional scale but its information on GI in urban areas is lacking. The detailed regional GI map is good for regional and to some degree even for local scale but its creation is time consuming. However, careful combination of existing national and regional data can provide good outcome in creating GI map usable for territorial planning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Available Data; Czech Republic; Green Infrastructure; Mapping","","","","The work presented here is a result from the international project MaGICLandscapes (Management of Green Infrastructure in Central European Landscapes) funded by INTERREG CENTRAL program, co-financed by ERDF.","On Nature Conservation and Landscape Protection; undefined; Agger, Peder, Dynamics of small biotopes in Danish agricultural landscapes, Landscape Ecology, 1, 4, pp. 227-240, (1988); Consolidated Layer of Ecosystems, (2013); Methodology of Defining Territorial System of Ecological Stability, (2017); Corine Land Cover Technical Guide Addendum 2000, (2000); Journal of Landscape Ecology, (2012); Buček, Antonín, Application of the Czech Methodology of Biogeographical Landscape Differentiation in Geobiocoenological Concept - Examples from Cuba, Tasmania and Yemen, Journal of Landscape Ecology (Czech Republic), 8, 3, pp. 51-67, (2015); Creating Green Infrastructure for Ireland, (2010); Tokarčíková, Katarína, Comparison of the current state of non-forest woody vegetation in two contrasted case study areas in Central Europe, Moravian Geographical Reports, 25, 1, pp. 24-33, (2017)","","Sciendo","","","","","","18054196; 18032427","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090569195"

Background and Objectives: Greece is currently developing and implementing a MAES nation-wide program based on the region's unique characteristics following the proposed methodologies by the European Commission, in the frame of the LIFE-IP 4 NATURA project (Integrated actions for the conservation and management of Natura 2000 sites, species, habitats and ecosystems in Greece). In this paper, we present the steps followed to compile standardizedMAES indicators for Greece that include: (a) collection and review of the available MAES-related datasets, (b) shortcomings and limitations encountered and overcome, (c) identification of data gaps and (d) assumptions and framework setting. Correspondence to EU and National Strategies and Policies are also examined to provide an initial guidance for detailed thematic studies. Materials and Methods: We followed the requirements of the EU MAES framework for ecosystem services and ecosystem condition indicator selection. Ecosystem services reported under the selected indicators were assigned following the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services. Spatial analysis techniques were applied to create relevant thematic maps. Results: A set of 40 MAES indicators was drafted, distributed in six general indicator groups, i.e., Biodiversity, Environmental quality, Food, material and energy, Forestry, Recreation and Water resources.

Arable plant communities are important elements of agroecosystems, because they support plant and animal biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. These plant communities are shaped by both agricultural and environmental drivers. The pressure of intensive agriculture worldwide has caused the decline of many characteristic arable species and communities. Italy is the European country where arable plant biodiversity is the best preserved. In this study, we assessed the patterns of co-occurrence of rare and threatened arable plants in 106 plots of winter arable vegetation located from Piedmont to Calabria, in the mainland part of the country. For this purpose, we based our investigation on the analysis of a recently acquired dataset and on the European list of rare and threatened arable plants. We highlight how different species of conservation interest tend to occur in the same community. On the other hand, generalist and more competitive taxa show similar patterns of co-occurrence. We suggest that single species of conservation value could be suitable indicators of a well-preserved community. On the other hand, to be effective, conservation strategies should target the whole community, rather than single species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agroecosystems; Arable Weeds; Biodiversity Conservation; Community Assemblage; Floristic Composition; Segetal Vegetation; Species Coexistence; Agricultural Ecosystem; Biodiversity; Coexistence; Community Composition; Plant Community; Rare Species; Species Occurrence; Weed; Calabria; Italy; Piedmont [italy]; Animalia","agricultural ecosystem; biodiversity; coexistence; community composition; plant community; rare species; species occurrence; weed; Calabria; Italy; Piedmont [Italy]; Animalia","","","Funding: This work was funded by Sapienza University of Rome (Project no.

Users may not be aware that data pertaining to the same fragment of land (in aspect of geometry or description attributes), but acquired from different sources do not always adequately reflect reality. After Poland's accession to the European Union, the EU Member States have undertaken to develop a Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) as part of the Integrated Administration and Control System in every country. The information aggregated by that system supports the payment of area-based subsidies, monitoring farmers' cross-compliance with selected environmental rules and the implementation of rural development programs. The LPIS was developed by compiling data from various sources, including the Cadastral Register (CR). The LPIS database is continuously modified to account for changes in the use of agricultural land. However, not all users are aware of these changes, and they regard LPIS data as identical to CR data. The above can breed conflict and legal complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which the reference data from the CR are modified in the LPIS. The CR was selected for this analysis because it is widely used for various purposes, including urban planning, calculation of taxes and public statistics. Geographic and descriptive data were analyzed, and the relationships between both data bases were determined (more than 12,000 elements were measured). The extent to which primary data were modified was expressed with the use of an indicator describing the percentage change in cadastral data. The study concerned geometry (I<inf>g</inf>), described parameters (I<inf>d</inf>) and the cumulative index (I<inf>c</inf>) of the examined objects. The results of the analysis indicate that the extent of changes in primary data varies across different locations. In more than 50 % of the analyzed objects, the relevant changes (cumulated index - I<inf>C</inf>) exceeded 50 %. These observations constitute valuable information for individuals, researchers or institutions who rely on LPIS resources. The proposed evaluation method can be used to assess the extent of data modification in other databases or locations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Area-based Payments; Cadastral Register; Land Parcel Identification System; Modification Of Geometry And Described Parameters; Agricultural Land; Compliance; Database; European Union; Gis; Land Use Planning; Policy Implementation; Rural Development; Spatial Data; Subsidy System; Poland [central Europe]","agricultural land; compliance; database; European Union; GIS; land use planning; policy implementation; rural development; spatial data; subsidy system; Poland [Central Europe]","","","","undefined, (2015); Economia Aziendale, (2008); Fig Congress 2010 Facing the Challenges Building the Capacity, (2010); Bórawski, Piotr, Price volatility of agricultural land in Poland in the context of the European Union, Land Use Policy, 82, pp. 486-496, (2019); Borowska-Stefańska, Marta, Spatial variation in size and shape of land plots in Mazowieckie voivodship, European Spatial Research and Policy, 25, 1, pp. 113-130, (2018); Cegielska, Katarzyna Małgorzata, Land use and land cover changes in post-socialist countries: Some observations from Hungary and Poland, Land Use Policy, 78, pp. 1-18, (2018); Central Statistical Office, (2015); Danskin, Scott D., Multipath mitigation under forest canopies: A choke ring antenna solution, Forest Science, 55, 2, pp. 109-116, (2009); undefined, (2016); Elia, E.

Indeed, over the years, the intensification of production through excessive or inappropriate use of pesticides and fertilisers in the agricultural sector has had a negative impact on natural resources. This negative environment impact has had both minor and major consequences for the natural resources present in the different areas of the European Union (EU). This variability depends mainly on the different agricultural training of farmers and on their ability to practise sustainable agriculture. Hence, with a specific set of agri-environmental indicators provided by the Eurostat database, this paper analyses the spatial and temporal variation of the agricultural land-use practices and the related environmental effects in EU countries. In pursuit of this aim, descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis (factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis) were adopted to determine the similarities/dissimilarities between the different types of agricultural production in the EU and the dominant dimensions of agricultural production and activities there in terms of their impact of natural resources in order to identify “homogeneity” among member states. The main contribution of this paper lies, above all, in the fact that the classification of these countries in four agro-ecosystems, with similar use of energy, pollution factors, and natural resources, could be useful as a tool for policymakers. Importantly, it could help them to define different incentives that could encourage farmers to adopt more sustainable agricultural production methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Activities; Environment; European Union (eu) Countries; Eurostat Indicators; Multivariate Statistical Analysis; Sustainability","","","","","European Environment Agency, (2019); Down to Earth Soil Degradation and Sustainable Development in Europe, (2000); Girardin, Philippe, Indicators: Tools to evaluate the environmental impacts of farming systems, Journal of Sustainable Agriculture, 13, 4, pp. 5-21, (1999); Environmental Indicators and Agricultural Policy, (1999); Environmental Indicators for Agriculture Methods and Results, (2001); Mitchell, Gordon N., PICABUE: A methodological framework for the development of indicators of sustainable development, International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 2, 2, pp. 104-123, (1995); Conservation Ecology, (2001); Jollands, Nigel A., How to aggregate sustainable development indicators: A proposed framework and its application, International Journal of Agricultural Resources, Governance and Ecology, 5, 1, pp. 18-34, (2006); Cloquell Ballester, Vicente Agustín, Indicators validation for the improvement of environmental and social impact quantitative assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 26, 1, pp. 79-105, (2006); Towards Sustainable Agriculture A Pilot Set of Indicators, (2000)","","MDPI AG membranes@mdpi.com","","","","","","20763298","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083836135"

Products were notified mainly by Italy, Germany, and United Kingdom and originated from Asian and European Union countries. The notification basis was border control and official control, and the notification type was border rejections, information, and alerts. Notified products were not distributed and not placed on the market, distribution status could be also not specified, or distribution was possible, also to other countries. The risk decision on hazard was usually not made. Products were redispatched, withdrawn from the market, and destroyed, or import was not authorized. Remarks, which can be used to improve the RASFF database, were also presented.

Anthelmintic Resistance (AR) in parasites is now widespread throughout Europe, although there are still gaps in our knowledge in some regions and countries. AR is a major threat to the sustainability of modern ruminant livestock production, resulting in reduced productivity, compromised animal health and welfare, and increased greenhouse gas emissions through increased parasitism and farm inputs. A better understanding of the extent of AR in Europe is needed to develop and advocate more sustainable parasite control approaches. A database of European published and unpublished AR research on gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) and liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) was collated by members of the European COST Action ""COMBAR""(Combatting Anthelmintic Resistance in Ruminants), and combined with data from a previous systematic review of AR in GIN. A total of 197 publications on AR in GIN were available for analysis, representing 535 studies in 22 countries and spanning the period 1980-2020. Reports of AR were present throughout the European continent and some reports indicated high within-country prevalence. Heuristic sample size-weighted estimates of European AR prevalence over the whole study period, stratified by anthelmintic class, varied between 0 and 48%. Estimated regional (country) prevalence was highly heterogeneous, ranging between 0% and 100% depending on livestock sector and anthelmintic class, and generally increased with increasing research effort in a country. In the few countries with adequate longitudinal data, there was a tendency towards increasing AR over time for all anthelmintic classes in GIN: aggregated results in sheep and goats since 2010 reveal an average prevalence of resistance to benzimidazoles (BZ) of 86%, macrocyclic lactones except moxidectin (ML) 52%, levamisole (LEV) 48%, and moxidectin (MOX) 21%. All major GIN genera survived treatment in various studies. In cattle, prevalence of AR varied between anthelmintic classes from 0-100% (BZ and ML), 0-17% (LEV) and 0-73% (MOX), and both Cooperia and Ostertagia survived treatment. Suspected AR in F. hepatica was reported in 21 studies spanning 6 countries. For GIN and particularly F. hepatica, there was a bias towards preferential sampling of individual farms with suspected AR, and research effort was biased towards Western Europe and particularly the United Kingdom. Ongoing capture of future results in the live database, efforts to avoid bias in farm recruitment, more accurate tests for AR, and stronger appreciation of the importance of AR among the agricultural industry and policy makers, will support more sophisticated analyses of factors contributing to AR and effective strategies to slow its spread. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anthelmintic Resistance; Database; Europe; Gastrointestinal Nematodes; Liver Fluke; Maps; Prevalence; Ruminants; Anthelmintics; Anthelmintic Agent; Animal; Animal Parasitosis; Bovine; Drug Effect; Drug Resistance; Europe; Goat; Livestock; Meta Analysis; Nematode; Nematodiasis; Parasitology; Sheep; Veterinary Medicine; Animals; Anthelmintics; Cattle; Drug Resistance; Goats; Livestock; Nematoda; Nematode Infections; Parasitic Diseases, Animal; Sheep","anthelmintic agent; animal; animal parasitosis; bovine; drug effect; drug resistance; Europe; goat; livestock; meta analysis; nematode; nematodiasis; parasitology; sheep; veterinary medicine; Animals; Anthelmintics; Cattle; Drug Resistance; Goats; Livestock; Nematoda; Nematode Infections; Parasitic Diseases, Animal; Sheep","","Anthelmintics","Acknowledgements.

Hence, it is essential to continuously enhance the data quality and spatial completeness to satisfy the increasing scientific research requirements. In this study, we explore the potential possibility of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) datasets in filling the gaps of ECV SM. The comprehensive assessment results show that: (1) The data missing percent of gap-filled ECV decreases 20% on average, which can be one step closer to generate a seamlessly covered global land surface SM product with favorable quality. (2) Compared to the original ECV, the gap-filled ECV products express similar good response to the in-situ measurements, suggesting that the SMAP SM products could be taken to efficiently fill the gaps and consistently maintain favorable accuracy at the same time. (3) Compared to the in-situ measurements, the original ECV SM products demonstrate extremely high probability density peak percentages. Fortunately, this eminent high value could be effectively rectified through gap-filling progress using SMAP. Overall, this study conducts objective and detailed evaluation on the performance of applying SMAP to fill the gaps of ECV, and is expected to act as a valuable reference in ECV SM gap-filling method. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gap-filling; Satellite Retrieved Soil Moisture; The Essential Climate Variable Soil Moisture; The Soil Moisture Active Passive Soil Moisture; Agricultural Robots; Filling; Climate Variables; Comprehensive Assessment; European Space Agency; Global Land Surface; High Probability; In-situ Measurement; Scientific Researches; Soil Moisture Active Passive (smap); Soil Moisture","Agricultural robots; Filling; Climate variables; Comprehensive assessment; European Space Agency; Global land surface; High probability; In-situ measurement; Scientific researches; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Soil moisture","","","This work was supported in part by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (A class) under Grant XDA19020304; in part by the National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents, China, under Grant BX20200100; in part by the GDAS’ Project of Science and Technology Development under Grant 2020GDASYL-20200103006, Grant 2020GDASYL-20200104003, Grant 2017GDASCX-0601, Grant 2017GDASCX-0801, Grant 2018GDASCX-0403, Grant 2019GDASYL-0301001, Grant 2019GDASYL-0501001, and Grant 2019GDASYL-0502001; in part by the Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program under Grant 2016ZT06D336; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41801362; in part by the Geographic Resources and Ecology Knowledge Service System of China Knowledge Center for Engineering Sciences and Technology under Grant CKCEST-2015-1-4; in part by the National Data Sharing Infrastructure of Earth System Science (http://www.geodata.cn/); and in part by the 13th Five-year Informatization Plan of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Construction of Scientific Data Center System, under Grant XXH-13514.","Bindlish, Rajat, GCOM-W AMSR2 soil moisture product validation using core validation sites, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 11, 1, pp. 209-219, (2018); Al Bitar, Ahmad, Evaluation of SMOS soil moisture products over continental U.S. Using the SCAN/SNOTEL network, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 50, 5 PART 1, pp. 1572-1586, (2012); Bindlish, Rajat, Soil moisture estimates from TRMM Microwave Imager observations over the Southern United States, Remote Sensing of Environment, 85, 4, pp. 507-515, (2003); Liu, Yangxiaoyue Xiao Yue, Evaluation of satellite-based soil moisture products over four different continental in-situmeasurements, Remote Sensing, 10, 7, (2018); Fan, Keke, Spatiotemporal impact of soil moisture on air temperature across the Tibet Plateau, Science of the Total Environment, 649, pp. 1338-1348, (2019); Im, Jungho, Downscaling of AMSR-E soil moisture with MODIS products using machine learning approaches, Environmental Earth Sciences, 75, 15, (2016); Zeng, Jiangyuan, Evaluation of remotely sensed and reanalysis soil moisture products over the Tibetan Plateau using in-situ observations, Remote Sensing of Environment, 163, pp. 91-110, (2015); Dorigo, Wouter, Error characterisation of global active and passive microwave soil moisture datasets, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 14, 12, pp. 2605-2616, (2010); Reichle, Rolf H., Global soil moisture from satellite observations, land surface models, and ground data: Implications for data assimilation, Journal of Hydrometeorology, 5, 3, pp. 430-442, (2004); Barrett, Brian W., Soil moisture retrieval from active spaceborne microwave observations: An evaluation of current techniques, Remote Sensing, 1, 3, pp. 210-242, (2009)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089306793"

Here, we report the first draft genome sequence of ‘Ca. Phytoplasma pini’ strain MDPP, which consists of 474,136 bases, with a G + C content of 22.22%. This information will facilitate comparative genomics of gymnosperm-infecting phytoplasmas. Phytoplasmas are bacterial plant pathogens that lack a cell wall and inhabit plant phloem tissue. Phytoplasmas cause a wide variety of symptoms such as yellowing, stunting, witches’brooms, phyllody, virescence, and little leaves. The mode of transmission for phytoplasmas from plant to plant is by insect vectors (Weintraub and Beanland 2006). Currently, more than 1,000 plant species have been described as host plants of phytoplasmas, including many agriculturally important crops (Bertaccini et al. 2014; Seemüller et al. 2013). Due to the lack of in vitro culture, available genome sequences of phytoplasmas are limited. Currently, the molecular characterization and classification is mainly based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence (IRPCM 2004; Lee et al. 1998; Wei et al. 2007). In April 2015, we identified a new ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pini’related strain from a pine tree located in a wooded area in Laurel, MD (Costanzo et al. 2016). This pine tree had excessive shoot branching, resulting in a witches’-broom phenotype. The strain was designated MDPP. Here, we report the first draft genome sequence of the strain MDPP, providing a resource for comparative genomics of gymnosperm-infecting phytoplasmas present in Europe and North America. Genomic DNA of strain MDPP was extracted from symptomatic pine needles using the DNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, U.S.A.). The pathogen titer level was estimated using 23S rRNA-based real-time quantitative PCR, giving a threshold cycle value of 18.66 per 2 ml of total infected plant DNA (Hodgetts et al. 2009). Bacterial DNA was enriched using the NEBNext microbiome DNA enrichment kit (New England Biolabs., Ipswich, MA, U.S.A.) that was further amplified using the REPLI-g Mini Kit (Qiagen). The 2 × 300-bp Illumina paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.). The paired-end sequencing libraries were prepared using an Illumina TruSeq PCR free DNA library prep kit. The DNA was fragmented using a Covaris M220 with an average size of 550 bp. In total, 5.17 × 107 reads with a mean of 269 bp/read were generated from MiSeq sequencing. These paired-end reads were aligned using bowtie2 (version 2.2.5) (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) to the Pinus taeda genome (loblolly pine) APFE000000000.3 and P. lambertiana genome (sugar pine) LMTP000000000.1. The resulting unmapped reads (31,810,002) were merged and used in de novo assembly using the SPAdes assembler (version 3.11.0) (Nurk et al. 2013) with a kmer of 51. The resulting contigs were screened for phytoplasma origin using blastx against nr and against 9 complete and 23 draft phytoplasma genomes available from the genomes database of NCBI. This generated 16 contigs that were well aligned with known phytoplasmas. The contigs ranged from 6,925 to 110,223 bp (N<inf>50</inf> = 40,003), corresponding to 55,309 reads of phytoplasma origin. The contigs comprised a total length of 474,136 bp, with a G + C content of 22.22% and an average coverage of 28×. Gene prediction was performed by GeneMark.hmm (version 3.05) (Besemer et al. 2001) using onion yellows phytoplasma as a model (GenBank accession number AP006628). The genome included 406 predicted open reading frames, 20 tRNA, and 3 rRNA coding genes (16S, 23S, and 5S rRNA).

We conducted a data analysis to identify the benefits of crop associations, alternative agricultural practices and strategies in four selected regions of Europe (Atlantic, Boreal, Mediterranean North and Mediterranean South) in terms of crop production (CP). The dataset was derived from 54 references with a total of 750 comparisons and included site characteristics, crop information (diversification system, crop production, tillage and fertilization management) and soil parameters. We analyzed each effect separately, comparing CP under tillage management (e.g., conventional tillage vs. no tillage), crop diversification (e.g., monoculture vs. rotation), and fertilization management (e.g., mineral fertilization vs. organic fertilization). Compared with conventional tillage (CT), CP was higher by 12% in no tillage (NT), in fine- and medium-textured soils (8–9%) and in arid and semiarid sites located in the Mediterranean Region (24%). Compared to monoculture, diversified cropping systems with longer crop rotations increased CP by 12%, and by 12% in soils with coarse and medium textures. In relation to fertilization, CP was increased with the use of slurry (40%), and when crop residues were incorporated (39%) or mulched (74%). Results showed that conversion to alternative diversified systems through the use of crop rotations, with NT and organic fertilization, results in a better crop performance. However, regional differences related to climate and soil-texture-specific responses should be considered to target local measures to improve soil management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arable Crops; Crop Production; Diversification; Fertilization Management; Tillage Management","","","","The work was funded within the Diverfarming project \u201CCrop diversification and low-input farming across Europe: from practitioners\u2019 engagement and ecosystems services to increased revenues and value chain organisation\u201D, a European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Programme for Research & Innovation, under grant agreement no 728003.","Lemaire, Gilles, Integrated crop-livestock systems: Strategies to achieve synergy between agricultural production and environmental quality, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 190, pp. 4-8, (2014); Lammerts Van Bueren, E.

Assessing the distribution and extent of such farmlands is useful for appropriate targeting of conservation measures and supporting associated rural communities. The conservation of species and habitats within HNVf is also among the aims of the EU's (European Union) Biodiversity Strategy and is a focus of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Rural Development Programme. Data on HNVf distribution and extent is required for both policy implementations under the CAP for income support payments and reporting within the EU Biodiversity strategy. Here, we extend the scope of the methodology from a previous study by presenting a finer spatial resolution to map the likely distribution of HNVf in the Republic of Ireland using indicators adapted for the Irish context and weighted based on expert knowledge and literature. The indicators (and weighting) used were: semi-natural habitat cover (40%, from CORINE land cover), stocking density (30%, from Land Parcel Information System; LPIS), hedgerow/scrub cover (10%), river and stream density (10%), and soil diversity (10%). Indicators were included in a weighted sum model (WSM) that combined raster indicator inputs, representing relative weights and the output had a tetrad-scale (2 km × 2 km) resolution. We used various datasets (national nature designations, Irish semi-natural grasslands survey, intensive farmland points and field points with semi-natural habitats) to validate the final HNVf map. To do this, all datasets were converted from polygon to point data format by considering the centroid of the polygon as the data point and overlaid on the HNVf map to assess the possible incidence. Of the 13,660 tetrads defined as farmland in the analysis, 4602 (33.7%) had a high or very high likelihood of being HNVf. About 54% of the latter set of tetrads partly or wholly coincided with Natura 2000 sites; about 84% partly or wholly coincided with NPWS priority areas for conservation of biodiversity in agri-environment schemes, and about 53% were in upland areas (>150 m a.s.l.). Validation data representing extensive farmland systems had an increasing incidence in tetrads with higher values (HNVf likelihood); the opposite was true for validation data representing intensive farmland. The final output was combined with the NPWS priority areas for farmland biodiversity conservation because the latter represented Type 3 HNV that is poorly represented by our method (which best represents Type 1 HNV). To our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive method to estimate and validate the extent and distribution of HNVf in the Republic of Ireland.

Water accounting, that is a standardized documentation of data on water resources, is a useful tool to provide this information. Pan-European data on climate impacts do not recognize local anthropogenic interventions in the water cycle. Most European river basins have a specific toolset that is understood and used by local experts and stakeholders. However, these local tools are not versatile. Thus, there is a need for a common approach that can be understood by multi-fold users to quantify impact indicators based on local data and that can be used to synthesize information at the European level. Then, policies can be designed with the confidence that underlying data are backed-up by local context and expert knowledge. This work presents a simplified water accounting framework that allows for a standardized examination of climate impacts on water resource availability and use across multiple basins. The framework is applied to five different river basins across Europe. Several indicators are extracted that explicitly describe green water fluxes versus blue water fluxes and impacts on agriculture. The examples show that a simplified water accounting framework can be used to synthesize basin-level information on climate change impacts which can support policymaking on climate adaptation, water resources and agriculture. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Climate Change Impacts; Hydrological Data; Water Accounting; Water Resources; Water Scarcity And Drought; Agriculture; Rivers; Water Management; Water Resources; Watersheds; Climate Change Impact; European Agriculture; Expert Knowledge; Hydrological Data; Impact Indicators; Resource Availability; Water Accountings; Water Scarcity; Climate Change; Anthropogenic Effect; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Data Set; Drought; Groundwater Resource; Hydrological Cycle; Resource Availability; River Basin; Water Resource","Agriculture; Rivers; Water management; Water resources; Watersheds; Climate change impact; European agriculture; Expert knowledge; Hydrological data; Impact indicators; Resource availability; Water accountings; Water scarcity; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; data set; drought; groundwater resource; hydrological cycle; resource availability; river basin; water resource","","","Funding: This research was funded by Horizon 2020 IMPREX project, grant number 641811.","Jacob, Daniela, Climate Impacts in Europe Under +1.5°C Global Warming, Earth's Future, 6, 2, pp. 264-285, (2018); Koutroulis, Aristeidis G., Cross sectoral impacts on water availability at +2°C and +3°C for east Mediterranean island states: The case of Crete, Journal of Hydrology, 532, pp. 16-28, (2016); Dezsi, Ștefan T., High-resolution projections of evapotranspiration and water availability for Europe under climate change, International Journal of Climatology, 38, 10, pp. 3832-3841, (2018); Forzieri, Giovanni, Multi-hazard assessment in Europe under climate change, Climatic Change, 137, 1-2, pp. 105-119, (2016); Ruosteenoja, Kimmo, Seasonal soil moisture and drought occurrence in Europe in CMIP5 projections for the 21st century, Climate Dynamics, 50, 3-4, pp. 1177-1192, (2018); Nat Hazards Earth Syst Sci Discuss, (2015); van Lanen, Henny A.J., Hydrology needed to manage droughts: the 2015 European case, Hydrological Processes, 30, 17, pp. 3097-3104, (2016); Moore, Frances C., Adaptation potential of European agriculture in response to climate change, Nature Climate Change, 4, 7, pp. 610-614, (2014); Iglesias, Ana, Adaptation strategies for agricultural water management under climate change in Europe, Agricultural Water Management, 155, pp. 113-124, (2015); Llop, Maria, Water and agriculture in a mediterranean region: The search for a sustainable water policy strategy, Water (Switzerland), 8, 2, (2016)","","MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073238089"

Global gridded data (GD) systems can minimize these problems. Thus, studies that validate GDs with “ground truth” are important for several applications such as climate change. The objective of this study was to compare long series of surface data with 10-day estimates of average air temperature (T) and precipitation (P) using data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for important agricultural locations in the states of Minas Gerais and São Paulo in Brazil. Despite the different spatial resolutions between ECMWF and NASA, the purpose of this paper was to evaluate the two data sources as they are readily available. The GD performance was evaluated by linear regression analysis. Analyses were performed for each meteorological variable for entire years and separated by seasons. The estimates of T from both ECMWF and NASA systems were accurate with the minimum Willmott concordance index (d) and RMSEp of 0.86, 0.37 °C, respectively, and precision with R2 0.61. The estimates of P had a minimum R2, d, and RMSEp of 0.48, 0.79, 2.15 °C respectively. The decreasing orders of (R2) were autumn > winter > spring > summer for T and winter > autumn > spring > summer for P, varying from 0.93 to 0.61 for T and from 0.77 to 0.48 for P. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big Data; Climatology; General Circulation Model; Ground Truth; Tropical Climate; Air Temperature; Climatology; Data Set; Ensemble Forecasting; General Circulation Model; Nscat; Precipitation Intensity; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Brazil; Minas Gerais; Sao Paulo [brazil]; Sao Paulo [sao Paulo (stt)]","air temperature; climatology; data set; ensemble forecasting; general circulation model; NSCAT; precipitation intensity; spatiotemporal analysis; Brazil; Minas Gerais; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Sao Paulo [Sao Paulo (STT)]","","","This research was supported by the Coordination of Improvement of Higher Level Personnel.","Albergel, Clément M.J., Soil moisture analyses at ECMWF: Evaluation using global ground-based in situ observations, Journal of Hydrometeorology, 13, 5, pp. 1442-1460, (2012); Bai, Jinshun, Evaluation of nasa satellite-and model-derived weather data for simulation of maize yield potential in China, Agronomy Journal, 102, 1, pp. 9-16, (2010); Bechtold, Peter, Advances in simulating atmospheric variability with the ECMWF model: From synoptic to decadal time-scales, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 134, 634 A, pp. 1337-1351, (2008); Near Real Time Global Radiation and Meteorology Web Services Available from NASA, (2010); Che, Tao, Estimation of snow depth from passive microwave brightness temperature data in forest regions of northeast China, Remote Sensing of Environment, 183, pp. 334-349, (2016); Couto, Flavio Tiago, Precipitation in the Madeira Island over a 10-year period and the meridional water vapour transport during the winter seasons, International Journal of Climatology, 35, 13, pp. 3748-3759, (2015); Davey, Christopher A., Microclimate exposures of surface-based weather stations, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 86, 4, pp. 497-504, (2005); European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts, (2015); Advances in Applied Science Research, (2011); Gaspar, Nilva Alice, Software for the management of weather stations and for agrometeorological calculations, Australian Journal of Crop Science, 9, 6, pp. 545-551, (2015)","","Springer-Verlag Wien michaela.bolli@springer.at","","","","","","14344483; 0177798X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057080261"

Estimation of economic loss due to flood often becomes necessary for flood damage mitigation. This present practice to carry out post flood survey to estimate damage, which is a laborious and time-consuming task. This paper presents a framework of rapid estimation of flood damage using SAR earth observation satellite data. In Nakhon Si Thammarat, a southern province in Thailand, flooding is a recurrent event affecting the entire province, especially the urban area. Every year, it causes lives and damages to infrastructure, agricultural production and severely affects local economic development. In order to monitor and estimate flood damages in near-real time, numerous techniques can be used, from a simply digitizing on maps, to using detailed surveys or remote sensing techniques. However, when using the last-mentioned technique, the results are conditioned by the time of data acquisition (day or night) as well as by weather conditions. Although, these impediments can be surpassed by using RADAR satellite imagery. The aim of this study is to delineate the land surface of Chian Yai, Pak Phanang and Hua Sai districts of that was affected by floods in December 2018 and January 2019. For this case study, Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR data provided by ESA (European Space Agency) were used.

The identification and quantification of the drivers of LULCC are crucial for improving our understanding of LULCC trends. So far, the biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of forest change have not been quantified at the regional scale, particularly for SSEA. In this study, we quantify the biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of forest change on a country-by-country basis in SSEA using an integrated quantitative methodology, which systematically accounts for previously published driver information and regional datasets. We synthesize more than 200 publications to identify the drivers of the forest change at different spatial scales in SSEA. Subsequently, we collect spatially explicit proxy data to represent the identified drivers. We quantify the dynamics of forest and agricultural land from 1992 to 2015 using the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) land cover data developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). A geographically weighted regression method is employed to quantify the spatially heterogeneous drivers of forest change. Our results show that socioeconomic drivers are more important than biophysical drivers for the conversion of forest to agricultural land in South Asia and maritime Southeast Asia. In contrast, biophysical drivers are more important than socioeconomic drivers for the conversion of agricultural land to forest in maritime Southeast Asia and less important in South Asia. Both biophysical and socioeconomic drivers contribute approximately equally to both changes in the mainland Southeast Asia region. By quantifying the dynamics of forest and agricultural land and the spatially explicit drivers of their changes in SSEA, this study provides a solid foundation for LULCC modeling and projection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Afforestation/reforestation; Deforestation; Drivers; Geographically Weighted Regression; Johnson's Relative Weight; South And Southeast Asia; Afforestation; Agricultural Land; Data Set; Environmental Impact Assessment; Forest Cover; Forest Dynamics; Land Use Change; Quantitative Analysis; Reforestation; Socioeconomic Conditions; South Asia; Southeast Asia; Agriculture; Asia; Climate Change; Forest; Socioeconomics; Trends; Agriculture; Asia, Southeastern; Climate Change; Forests; Socioeconomic Factors","afforestation; agricultural land; data set; environmental impact assessment; forest cover; forest dynamics; land use change; quantitative analysis; reforestation; socioeconomic conditions; South Asia; Southeast Asia; agriculture; Asia; climate change; forest; socioeconomics; trends; Agriculture; Asia, Southeastern; Climate Change; Forests; Socioeconomic Factors","","","This work is supported by the United States Department of Energy (No. DE-SC0016323) and NASA Land-Cover/Land-Use Change Program (No. NNX14AD94G).","Shajaat Ali, Abu Muhammad, Rice to shrimp: Land use/land cover changes and soil degradation in Southwestern Bangladesh, Land Use Policy, 23, 4, pp. 421-435, (2006); Engineering Earth the Impacts of Megaengineering Projects, (2011); Bruggeman, Derek, Forest cover changes in Bhutan: Revisiting the forest transition, Applied Geography, 67, pp. 49-66, (2016); Bruun, Thilde Bech, Environmental consequences of the demise in Swidden cultivation in Southeast Asia: Carbon storage and soil quality, Human Ecology, 37, 3, pp. 375-388, (2009); Cervarich, Matthew Charles, The terrestrial carbon budget of South and Southeast Asia, Environmental Research Letters, 11, 10, (2016); Chao, Yi Chun E., Quantifying the relative importance of predictors in multiple linear regression analyses for public health studies, Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene, 5, 8, pp. 519-529, (2008); Geographically Weighted Regression, (2009); de Sherbinin, Alex, Migration and risk: Net migration in marginal ecosystems and hazardous areas, Environmental Research Letters, 7, 4, (2012); Land Cover Cci Product User Guide Version 2 0, (2017); Deng, Jinsong, PCA-based land-use change detection and analysis using multitemporal and multisensor satellite data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 29, 16, pp. 4823-4838, (2008)","","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","","","13541013; 13652486","","","30830699","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063249530"

High BOD concentrations reduce oxygen availability, degrade aquatic habitats and biodiversity, and impair water use. High BOD loadings to freshwater systems are mainly coming from anthropogenic sources, comprising domestic and livestock waste, industrial emissions, and combined sewer overflows. We developed a conceptual model (GREEN + <inf>BOD</inf> ) to assess mean annual current organic pollution (BOD fluxes) across Europe. The model was informed with the latest available European datasets of domestic and industrial emissions, population and livestock densities. Model parameters were calibrated using 2008–2012 mean annual BOD concentrations measured in 2157 European monitoring stations, and validated with other 1134 stations. The most sensitive model parameters were abatement of BOD by secondary treatment and the BOD decay exponent of travel time. The mean BOD concentrations measured in monitored stations was 2.10 mg O <inf>2</inf> /L and predicted concentrations were 2.54 mg O <inf>2</inf> /L; the 90th percentile of monitored BOD concentration was 3.51 mg O <inf>2</inf> /L while the predicted one was 4.76 mg O <inf>2</inf> /L. The model could correctly classify reaches for BOD concentrations classes, from high to poor quality, in 69% of cases. High overestimations (incorrect classification by 2 or more classes) were 2% and large underestimations were 5% of cases. Across Europe about 12% of freshwater network was estimated to be failing good quality due to excessive BOD concentrations (>5 mg O <inf>2</inf> /L). Dominant sources of BOD to freshwaters and seas were point sources and emissions from intensive livestock systems. Comparison with previous assessments confirms a decline of BOD pollution since the introduction of EU legislation regulating water pollution. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bod; Green +; Organic Pollution; Water Framework Directive; Water Quality; Oxygen; Oxygen; Agriculture; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Biodiversity; Environmental Regulations; Industrial Emissions; Laws And Legislation; Oxygen; Travel Time; Water Conservation; Water Quality; Anthropogenic Sources; Biochemical Oxygen Demands (bod); Combined Sewer Overflows; Green^+; Microbiological Contaminations; Monitoring Stations; Organic Pollution; Water Framework Directives; Water Pollution; Anthropogenic Source; Biochemical Oxygen Demand; Concentration (composition); Freshwater; Organic Pollutant; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Article; Black Sea; Calibration; Clinical Assessment; Concentration (parameter); Domestic Waste; Environmental Monitoring; European; Freshwater Environment; Industrial Waste; Mediterranean Sea; Organic Pollution; Population Research; Prediction; Priority Journal; Sea Surface Waters; Urban Area; Analysis; Chemistry; Europe; Procedures; Season; Theoretical Model; Fresh Water; Oxygen; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Fresh Water; Models, Theoretical; Seasons; Water Pollution, Chemical","Agriculture; Biochemical oxygen demand; Biodiversity; Environmental regulations; Industrial emissions; Laws and legislation; Oxygen; Travel time; Water conservation; Water quality; Anthropogenic sources; Biochemical oxygen demands (BOD); Combined sewer overflows; Green^+; Microbiological contaminations; Monitoring stations; Organic pollution; Water Framework Directives; Water pollution; anthropogenic source; biochemical oxygen demand; concentration (composition); freshwater; organic pollutant; water pollution; water quality; Article; Black Sea; calibration; clinical assessment; concentration (parameter); domestic waste; environmental monitoring; European; freshwater environment; industrial waste; Mediterranean Sea; organic pollution; population research; prediction; priority journal; sea surface waters; urban area; analysis; chemistry; Europe; procedures; season; theoretical model; fresh water; oxygen; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Fresh Water; Models, Theoretical; Seasons; Water Pollution, Chemical","","oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen","This work has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement No. 603629 \u2013 project \u201CGlobaqua\u201D.

To answer this question, a spatial approach is suggested, namely an approach that considers geography as a factor in measuring the success of such policy. A geographical approach can be used to pinpoint “hotspots” in order to determine an appropriate distribution of funds. To implement such an approach to the distribution of EU funding, a Spatial Fuzzy Partitioning Around Medoids (SFPAM) analysis is advocated. The contribution of this research is that it combines a temporal dimension within an explicitly spatial approach. It achieves this by using a dataset that includes both geographical and economic factors such as farm sizes, their management, the number of organic farms involved, the agriculture area invested by the AEM and the size of the workforce involved. Its strategy is the identification of medoids which are represented by a specific municipality. This allows the identification of aggregated neighborhoods for the visualization of AEM outcomes based on a fuzzy partitioning method. The results provide useful policy implications to determine where and when financial efforts should be renewed, where to negotiate sustainable development strategies, and how to expand spatially the benefits of financial funding to other agricultural measures, such as technological innovations in agriculture, reforestation programs, marketing strategies, climate change mitigation, and rural development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agri-environmental Measures; Common Agriculture Policy (cap); Geographical Information Science (gis); Regional Development; Spatial Fuzzy Partitioning Around Medoids (sfpam); Agri-environmental Policy; Agricultural Economics; Common Agricultural Policy; Development Strategy; European Union; Gis; Innovation; Regional Development; Sustainable Development; Visualization; Italy; Sardinia","agri-environmental policy; agricultural economics; Common Agricultural Policy; development strategy; European Union; GIS; innovation; regional development; sustainable development; visualization; Italy; Sardinia","","","","Bateman, Ian J., Bringing ecosystem services into economic decision-making: Land use in the United Kingdom, Science, 341, 6141, pp. 45-50, (2013); Dinamiche Demografiche in Sardegna Tra Passato E Futuro, (2012); Burton, Rob J.F., Result-oriented agri-environmental schemes in Europe and their potential for promoting behavioural change, Land Use Policy, 30, 1, pp. 628-641, (2013); Coppi, Renato, A fuzzy clustering model for multivariate spatial time series, Journal of Classification, 27, 1, pp. 54-88, (2010); Diti, Irene, The agri-environmental footprint: A method for the identification and classification of peri-urban areas, Journal of Environmental Management, 162, pp. 250-262, (2015); D'Urso, Pierpaolo, Fuzzy clustering, pp. 545-574, (2015); D'Urso, Pierpaolo, Trimmed fuzzy clustering for interval-valued data, Advances in Data Analysis and Classification, 8, 1, pp. 21-40, (2015); Cluster Analysis, (2001); Politiche Di Sviluppo Rurale Tra Programmazione E Valutazione, (2003); Galler, Carolin, Optimizing environmental measures for landscape multifunctionality: Effectiveness, efficiency and recommendations for agri-environmental programs, Journal of Environmental Management, 151, pp. 243-257, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","02648377","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062221600"

Measurements of soil moisture at regional scales have traditionally been sparse, but advances in land surface modelling and the development of satellite technology to indirectly measure surface soil moisture has led to the emergence of a number of national and global soil moisture data sets that can provide insight into the dynamics of agricultural drought. Droughts are often defined by normal conditions for a given time and place; as a result, data sets used to quantify drought need a representative baseline of conditions in order to accurately establish a normal. This presents a challenge when working with earth observation data sets which often have very short baselines for a single instrument. This study assessed three soil moisture data sets: a surface satellite soil moisture data set from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission operating since 2010; a blended surface satellite soil moisture data set from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) that has a long history and a surface and root zone soil moisture data set from the Canadian Meteorology Centre (CMC)'s Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS). An iterative chi-squared statistical routine was used to evaluate each data set's sensitivity to canola yields in Saskatchewan, Canada. The surface soil moisture from all three data sets showed a similar temporal trend related to crop yields, showing a negative impact on canola yields when soil moisture exceeded a threshold in May and June. The strength and timing of this relationship varied with the accuracy and statistical properties of the data set, with the SMOS data set showing the strongest relationship (peak X2 = 170 for Day of Year 145), followed by the ESA-CCI (peak X2 = 89 on Day of Year 129) and then the RDPS (peak X2 = 65 on Day of Year 129). Using short baseline soil moisture data sets can produce consistent results compared to using a longer data set, but the characteristics of the years used for the baseline are important. Soil moisture baselines of 18-20 years or more are needed to reliably estimate the relationship between high soil moisture and high yielding years. For the relationship between low soil moisture and low yielding years, a shorter baseline can be used, with reliable results obtained when 10-15 years of data are available, but with reasonably consistent results obtained with as few as 7 years of data. This suggests that the negative impacts of drought on agriculture may be reliably estimated with a relatively short baseline of data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Drought; Esa-cci; Smos; Soil Moisture; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops; Drought; Satellites; Soil Moisture; Space Applications; Surface Measurement; Earth Observation Data; Esa-cci; Land Surface Modelling; Root Zone Soil Moistures; Satellite Soil Moisture; Smos; Soil Moisture And Ocean Salinity Missions; Statistical Properties; Soil Surveys","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Drought; Satellites; Soil moisture; Space applications; Surface measurement; Earth observation data; ESA-CCI; Land surface modelling; Root zone soil moistures; Satellite soil moisture; SMOS; Soil moisture and ocean salinity missions; Statistical properties; Soil surveys","","","","Weatherwise, (1968); Quiring, Steven M., An evaluation of agricultural drought indices for the Canadian prairies, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 118, 1-2, pp. 49-62, (2003); Sheffield, Justin, A simulated soil moisture based drought analysis for the United States, Journal of Geophysical Research, 109, 24, pp. 1-19, (2004); International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, (2016); Cui, Chenyang, Soil moisture mapping from satellites: An intercomparison of SMAP, SMOS, FY3B, AMSR2, and ESA CCI over two dense network regions at different spatial scales, Remote Sensing, 10, 1, (2018); Crow, Wade T., On the utility of land surface models for agricultural drought monitoring, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 16, 9, pp. 3451-3460, (2012); Han, Eunjin, Benchmarking a soil moisture data assimilation system for agricultural drought monitoring, Journal of Hydrometeorology, 15, 3, pp. 1117-1134, (2014); Mishra, Ashok Kumar, A review of drought concepts, Journal of Hydrology, 391, 1-2, pp. 202-216, (2010); Heim, Richard R., A review of twentieth-century drought indices used in the United States, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 83, 8, pp. 1149-1165, (2002); Champagne, Catherine M., Monitoring agricultural risk in Canada using L-band passive microwave soil moisture from SMOS, Journal of Hydrometeorology, 16, 1, pp. 5-18, (2015)","","MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","20724292","9780891814184; 0891814183; 9780123694072","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062507704"

We used annual and seasonal spectral-temporal metrics and environmental features to map 12 land cover and land use classes across Europe. The spectral-temporal metrics provided an efficient means to capture seasonal variations of land surface spectra and to reduce the impact of clouds and cloud-shadows by relaxing the otherwise strong cloud cover limitations imposed by image-based classification methods. The best classification model was based on Landsat-8 data from three years (2014–2016) and achieved an accuracy of 75.1%, nearly 2 percentage points higher than the classification model based on a single year of Landsat data (2015). Our results indicate that annual pan-European land cover maps are feasible, but that temporally dynamic classes like artificial land, cropland, and grassland still benefit from more frequent satellite observations. The produced pan-European land cover map compared favorably to the existing CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) 2012 land cover dataset. The mapped country-wide area proportions strongly correlated with LUCAS-estimated area proportions (r = 0.98). Differences between mapped and LUCAS sample-based area estimates were highest for broadleaved forest (map area was 9% higher). Grassland and seasonal cropland areas were 7% higher than the LUCAS estimate, respectively. In comparison, the correlation between LUCAS and CORINE area proportions was weaker (r = 0.84) and varied strongly by country. CORINE substantially overestimated seasonal croplands by 63% and underestimated grassland proportions by 37%. Our study shows that combining current state-of-the-art remote sensing methods with the large LUCAS database improves pan-European land cover mapping. Although this study focuses on European land cover, the unique combination of large survey data and machine learning of spectral-temporal metrics, may also serve as a reference case for other regions.

Organic agriculture, including food, (hereinafter - agri-food) production shows considerable growth on the global and European Union (EU) level, including Latvia. It has been widely considered by scholars, experts and politicians that organic agri-food production is beneficial for rural development through: enhanced entrepreneur activities; growth of jobs; creation of added value and alternative food chains; and, especially, increase well-being for rural inhabitants. Besides, organic farming generates environmental and socio-economic benefits to society and provides various ecosystem services (e.g., landscape, biodiversity). The aim of the study is twofold: 1) to assess the latest development trends and issues of organic agri-food production, as well as its spatial aspects; 2) to evaluate the support to organic agri-food by the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-20120. The principal materials used in the studies are as follows: different sources of literature, e.g., scholars’ articles, research papers and the reports of institutions, as well as EU and Latvia’s legislation. The data have been obtained from: Eurostat online database, online database of Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia, Food and Veterinary Service and unpublished data from the Latvian Rural Support Service. The appropriate qualitative and quantitative research methods for certain tasks have been used in the process of study: monographic; content analysis and synthesis; logical and abstract construction; data grouping; correlation and linear regression etc. Although the number of organic holdings and utilized agricultural area (UAA) under organic farming is high in Latvia, the agricultural production share or output is almost negligible. Only one organic product - honey has high share 30% from total production volume. Either organic food processors and processed food share from total food is negligible compared to the number of organic farms and share of organic land. There are some limitations, which hinder further development of organic agriculture in Latvia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agri-food; Farming; Organic; Subsidies; Agricultural Robots; Biodiversity; Economics; Ecosystems; Regional Planning; Rural Areas; Veterinary Medicine; Abstract Construction; Agricultural Areas; Agricultural Productions; Environment Friendly; Organic Agriculture; Quantitative Research Methods; Socio-economic Benefits; Veterinary Services; Agriculture","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Economics; Ecosystems; Regional planning; Rural areas; Veterinary medicine; Abstract construction; Agricultural areas; Agricultural productions; Environment friendly; Organic agriculture; Quantitative research methods; Socio-economic benefits; Veterinary services; Agriculture","","","","EC Organic Farming in the Eu; Action Plan for the Future of Organic Production in the European Union, (2014); Melece, Ligita, Development of local food systems in Latvia, 2, pp. 104-111, (2015); Seufert, Verena, Many shades of gray—the context-dependent performance of organic agriculture, Science Advances, 3, 3, (2017); Reganold, John P., Organic agriculture in the twenty-first century, Nature Plants, 2, 2, (2016); Meier, Matthias Samuel, Environmental impacts of organic and conventional agricultural products - Are the differences captured by life cycle assessment?, Journal of Environmental Management, 149, pp. 193-208, (2015); Melece, Ligita, Farm size and farming method’s impact on ecosystem services: Latvia’s case, International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM, 18, 5.1, pp. 393-400, (2018); Statistics Explained; Regulation Eu 2018 848 on Organic Production and Labelling of Organic Products; Legal Acts of the Republic of Latvia","","International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference","","19th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference, SGEM 2019","","Albena","150491","13142704","9786197603200; 9786197603323; 9786197105810; 9786197105049; 9786197105582; 978-619-7105-01-8; 9786197408423; 9786197603743; 9786197105186; 9786197408270","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084340745"

The 2013 CAP reform introduced several new measures. In budgetary terms, basic payment and greening were the most significant ones. Besides, coupled supports, young farmer and small farmers scheme should be mentioned. To reveal the changes caused by these measures, the time horizon of the study is 2013-2017. Since the subsidies represent a significant part of the income generated in the agricultural sector, the basic hypothesis of the study is that the production units concerned (individual farms, private enterprises) gave economically rational answers. In practice, this means trying to fully adapt to the changes to maximize support. Based on the analysed datasets (Hungarian Central Statistical Office and Hungarian State Treasury), it became evident that farmers responded rationally: splitting up farms against capping, moving towards the lowest resistance to comply with greening, plus associating them with the extra support of coupled payments. Generational renewal is a key issue; however, the present form of young farmers scheme needs to be refined to be more effective. Small farmers scheme is a good opportunity for farmers with less than 5.5 ha and most of the concerned farmers chose well. However, there are about 6,000 farms that are too small for the standard system, while 772 farms that are too large for the small farmers scheme. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Basic Payment; Coupled Support; Degressivity And Capping; Greening; Young And Small Farmers Scheme; Budget Control; Regional Planning; Agricultural Policies; Agricultural Sector; Basic Payment; Common Agricultural Policy; Degressivity And Capping; Greening; Statistical Offices; Young And Small Farmers Scheme; Agriculture","Budget control; Regional planning; Agricultural policies; Agricultural sector; Basic payment; Common agricultural policy; Degressivity and capping; Greening; Statistical Offices; Young and small farmers scheme; Agriculture","","","","Act Cxxii of 2013 on Transactions in Agricultural and Forestry Land, (2013); Magyar Mezogazdasag, (2015); Alons, Gerry, Environmental policy integration in the EU’s common agricultural policy: greening or greenwashing?, Journal of European Public Policy, 24, 11, pp. 1604-1622, (2017); Bartolini, Fabio, The common agricultural policy and the determinants of changes in EU farm size, Land Use Policy, 31, pp. 126-135, (2013); Ciliberti, Stefano, The CAP 2013 reform of direct payments: redistributive effects and impacts on farm income concentration in Italy, Agricultural and Food Economics, 6, 1, (2018); Presentation Association of Hungarian Simmertal Professional Days, (2017); Workshop Documentation Directorate General for Internal Policies Policy Department B Structural and Cohesion Policies, (2016); Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament the Council the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the 2017 List of Critical Raw Materials for the Eu, (2017); Common Agricultural Policy A Story to Be Continued, (2012); Is Cross Compliance an Effective Policy, (2008)","","Jelgava : Latvia University of Agriculture Ausma.Markevica@llu.lv","","25th Annual International Scientific Conference Research for Rural Development, 2019","","Jelgava; Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies","141948","16914031; 2255923X","9789984484396; 9789984784014; 9789984784144","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080854440"

Copernicus Land monitoring service, through the High-Resolution Layers, aims to map those SWFs at Pan-European level (39 countries, 6 million square kilometers) with the use of more than 37,000 Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) Earth Observation (EO) scenes. This unprecedented mapping exercise is focused on the extraction of SWF with a maximum width of 30m and a minimum length of 50m for linear features and a minimum and maximum area of 200 and 5,000m respectively.

This highly efficient methodology based on differential attribute profiles (DAP) and classical classifier such as Random-Forest is particularly adapted to this exercise since it combines the use of spatial information and the spectral signature of each pixel.

The precipitation data is obtained from the European Climate Assessment and Dataset project for the period 1961-2014, for 8 meteorological stations in northern Serbia, 5 in Hungary and 1 in eastern Croatia. The extreme values of precipitation were calculated following the indices developed by the ETCCDI. RclimDex software package was used for indices calculation. Based on statistical analysis and the calculated values, the results have been presented with Geographic Information System (GIS) to point out the most vulnerable parts of the Pannonian basin, with regard to pluvial erosion. This study presents the first result of combined rainfall erosivity and extreme precipitation indices for the investigated area. Results of PCI indicate presence of moderate precipitation concentration (mean value 11.6). Trend analysis of FI (mean value 22.7) and MFI (mean value 70.2) implies a shift from being largely in the low erosivity class, to being completely in the moderate erosivity class in the future, thus indicating an increase in rainfall erosivity for most of the investigated area (except in the northwestern parts). Furthermore, the observed precipitation extremes suggest that both the amount and the intensity of precipitation are increasing. The knowledge about the areas affected by strong soil erosion could lead to introducing effective measures in order to reduce it. Long term analysis of rainfall erosivity is a significant step concerning flood prevention, hazard mitigation, ecosystem services, land use change and agricultural production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Erosion; Extreme Precipitation Indices; Natural Hazard; Pannonian Basin; Precipitation; Rainfall Erosivity; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Erosion; Flood Control; Hazards; Land Use; Precipitation (chemical); Agricultural Productions; Effective Measures; Extreme Precipitation; Meteorological Station; Natural Hazard; Pannonian Basin; Precipitation Extremes; Rainfall Erosivity; Rain; Concentration (composition); Erosivity; Extreme Event; Natural Hazard; Precipitation Intensity; Rainfall; Soil Erosion; Croatia; Hungary; Pannonian Basin; Serbia","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Erosion; Flood control; Hazards; Land use; Precipitation (chemical); Agricultural productions; Effective measures; Extreme precipitation; Meteorological station; Natural hazard; Pannonian basin; Precipitation extremes; Rainfall erosivity; Rain; concentration (composition); erosivity; extreme event; natural hazard; precipitation intensity; rainfall; soil erosion; Croatia; Hungary; Pannonian Basin; Serbia","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by Projects 176020 and 43002 of the Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development and by Project 114-451-2080/2017 of the Provincial Secretariat for Science and Technological Development, Vojvodina Province.

Grower magazines and wine journals have reported the renaissance of neglected and even threatened grape cultivars, raising awareness and promoting their cultivation by vine-growers. Minor cultivars represent huge value with respect to cultural heritage, adaptation to ecological conditions, diversification of products and marketing of specialities with a higher economic benefit. Recognizing the heritage and value of traditional crop genetic diversity maintained on farms, in 2017, the European Cooperative Program for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR) published a “Concept for on-farm conservation and management of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture”. ECPGR described a future strategy for the preservation of genetic resources. Priority actions defined are transmissible to grapevine. They encompass the development of descriptors, inventory of on-farm vineyards, definition of threat categories and overcoming of legal obstacles, ensuring that obsolete cultivars can be grown. Focus on these four issues took place under the scope of the ECPGR grant scheme activity “On-farm inventory of minor grape varieties in the European Vitis Database” in 2017. Twelve researchers from ten countries (Albania, Austria, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Montenegro, Portugal, Serbia, Spain) participated. Descriptors were selected for the grower (12 descriptors), cultivar preserved (17 descriptors), vineyard description (17 descriptors) and commitments (six descriptors). To date, 191 vineyards have been registered: in Spain (105), Albania (16), Montenegro (14), Croatia (13), Germany (13), France (17), Portugal (5), Serbia (5) and Austria (3). An on-farm database was developed (http://www.eu-vitis.de/onfarm/index.php). Criteria for four threat categories were defined and used to initiate a process for legal inclusion of rare historical cultivars in national cultivar catalogues. Preservation under practice conditions provides deeper knowledge of agronomic features and wine quality of traditional grape cultivars and relieves stress on grapevine collections. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diversity; Genetic Erosion; Grape Cultivars; Growers; Preservation","","","","","Kreutterbuch; Bull O I V Off Int Vigne Vin, (1998); Boursiquot, Jean Michel, Parentage of merlot and related winegrape cultivars of southwestern france: Discovery of the missing link, Australian Journal of Grape and Wine Research, 15, 2, pp. 144-155, (2009); Enotecnico, (1991); Crespan, Manna, Recognition and genotyping of minor germplasm of Friuli Venezia Giulia revealed high diversity, Vitis - Journal of Grapevine Research, 50, 1, pp. 21-28, (2011); Vom Ackerbaw Erdtwucher Und Bawleiite Von Natur Art Gebrauch Und Nutzbarkeit Aller Gewech Fruchten Thyeren Samt Allem Dem so Dem Menschen Dyenstlich in Spey Und Artzeneyung, (1531); Ecpgr Concept for on Farm Conservation and Management of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, (2017); Oj L, (2008); Ibáñez, Javier, Genetic origin of the grapevine cultivar tempranillo, American Journal of Enology and Viticulture, 63, 4, pp. 549-553, (2012); Dtsch Weinbau Jahrbuch 2009, (2008)","","International Society for Horticultural Science dirk.vanholderbeke@ishs.org Pastoriestraat Bierbeek 3360","","","","","","05677572; 24066168","9789066056831; 9789066059467; 9789462611382; 9789066056343; 9789066058262; 9789066051492; 9789462611375; 9789066052680; 9789462610842; 906605445X","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072525130"

Among agricultural landscapes, vineyards are responsible for the highest erosion rates, particularly in steep-slope landscapes. The impact of vineyard mechanisation on soil loss is only marginally explored in published literature. This study provides an estimation of the annual soil loss rate by application of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in 24 terraced vineyards located in north-eastern Italy. Field observations showed that 13 vineyards consisted of fully mechanised fields, 5 vineyards had no form of mechanisation, while in 6 vineyards a mixture of practices was found. Soil erodibility (K factor) was derived for these practices (based on soil characteristics and varying degrees of compaction), while slope length and steepness (LS factors) were calculated from a 1-m LiDAR-based DTM, and remaining factors were based on datasets by the European Soil Data Centre. Mechanised fields showed 29% higher erosion rates than non-mechanised fields (respectively 53.9 and 69.5 t ha-1 y-1), although this is not statistically significant. Still, the direct impact of mechanisation is underestimated in this comparison, due to the predominant steep slopes in the manually cultivated fields. Furthermore, estimated soil loss from mechanised fields in addition to mechanised paths and roads is significantly higher by 37% than non-mechanised fields. This study thus offers an indication of how machinery and related soil compaction and transformation of terraces and infrastructure, increases soil loss risk. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Compaction; Erosion; Mechanization; Northeastern Italy; Rusle; Vineyard Terraces","","","","This study was supported by project ViTE; “Vineyard Terraced landscapes: understanding the Environmental constraints to improve sustainable managements”, funded by the Linda Scattolin research program related to the TESAF department of the University of Padova (Italy).

In this paper, we used the latest global land cover data published by the European Space Agency (ESA) to investigate spatiotemporal variation characteristics of forest cover in developing countries from 1992 to 2015, and then analyzed causal factors of this variation using a binary logistic regression model. Existing studies on FT are mostly based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); this study improves our understanding of FT mechanisms through the use of a new dataset. The results indicate that the forest area in developing countries decreased from 21.8 to 21.3 million km2 from 1992-2015, and the rate of decline slowed after 2004. South America suffered the largest reduction in forest area (505,100 km2), whereas forest area in Africa increased slightly. By 2015, more than 80% of African countries had experienced FT, whereas only half of developing countries experienced forest expansion in South America. The variables affecting FT occurrence differed among continents. On the global scale, the remaining forest coverage and the proportion of forest exports negatively affected the likelihood of FT occurrence, whereas urbanization level had a positive effect. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developing Countries; Driving Factors; Forest Cover; Forest Transition; Developing World; Food And Agricultural Organization; Forest Cover; Forest Management; Spatial Variation; Sustainable Forestry; Temporal Variation; Urbanization; Africa; South America","developing world; Food and Agricultural Organization; forest cover; forest management; spatial variation; sustainable forestry; temporal variation; urbanization; Africa; South America","","","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 41771116, and Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Pan-Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road (Pan-TPE), grant number XDA20040400.","Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael, Trends in global research in deforestation.

This study intercompares total aerosol optical depth (AOD) and dust AOD (DAOD) from two global reanalyses datasets, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) and the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research-2 (MERRA-2). These are evaluated against AeroSpan (Aerosol characterisation via Sun photometry: Australian Network) ground observations which forms part of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) over the Australian continent for the 2002–2012 period. During dust storms, AeroSpan/AERONET AOD measurements were missing due to cloud screening. To overcome validation limitations in sun photometry for dust events, a nephelometer's scattering coefficient is qualitatively compared against reanalysis of DAOD at a key dust storm activation site, Tinga Tingana in South Australia (~200 km east of Lake Eyre). A specific extreme event that occurred in 2009 originating from the Lake Eyre basin, a major dust source covering one-sixth of Australia, was studied. The results show that MERRA-2 reanalysis overestimates monthly total AOD twice as much compared to AeroSpan/AERONET ground observations but seems better correlated against AeroSpan/AERONET than ECMWF/MACC. Mean data of MERRA-2 time series over 10 years provide lower DAOD values and lower dust aerosol estimates than ECMWF/MACC reanalysis (over the Lake Eyre basin with spatial averaging). Specifically at Tinga Tingana, the correlation from MERRA-2 (0.45 correlation) and ECMWF/MACC (0.43 correlation) against AeroSpan/AERONET's AOD were similar. Between MERRA-2 and ECMWF/MACC decade long daily gridded DAOD, the correlation coefficient was high at 0.73, again indicating similarity between the datasets. MERRA-2 total AOD correlation is significantly higher (by 0.26) against AeroSpan/AERONET than ECMWF/MACC. MERRA-2 also provides higher AOD values in extreme cases which may correspond to dust storms. During dust storms, a hybrid strategy using nephelometers and hourly reanalysis from MERRA-2 is able to identify dust storms better than AeroSpan/AERONET. Overall, this work can enable and inform better aerosol data assimilation into forecast models such as for solar energy, agriculture or air quality over Australia. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aeronet; Aerosol Optical Depth; Australian Dust Aod; Ecmwf/macc; Merra-2; Reanalysis; Air Quality; Atmospheric Chemistry; Atmospheric Composition; Atmospheric Thermodynamics; Dust; Lakes; Nasa; Optical Properties; Photometry; Solar Energy; Storms; Weather Forecasting; Aerosol Optical Depths; Aerosol Robotic Networks; Australian Dust Aerosol Optical Depth; Dust Aerosols; European Center For Medium-range Weather Forecast/monitoring Atmospheric Composition And Climate; European Center For Medium-range Weather Forecasts; Modern-era Retrospective Analyse For Research-2; Reanalysis; Retrospective Analysis; Atmospheric Aerosols; Aeronet; Aerosol Property; Dust; Extreme Event; Ground-based Measurement; Light Scattering; Optical Depth; Photometer; Weather Forecasting; Australia; South Australia","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Dust; Lakes; NASA; Optical properties; Photometry; Solar energy; Storms; Weather forecasting; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol robotic networks; Australian dust aerosol optical depth; Dust aerosols; European center for medium-range weather forecast/monitoring atmospheric composition and climate; European center for medium-range weather forecasts; Modern-era retrospective analyse for research-2; Reanalysis; Retrospective analysis; Atmospheric aerosols; AERONET; aerosol property; dust; extreme event; ground-based measurement; light scattering; optical depth; photometer; weather forecasting; Australia; South Australia","","","","undefined, (2018); Alexandri, Georgia, A high resolution satellite view of surface solar radiation over the climatically sensitive region of Eastern Mediterranean, Atmospheric Research, 188, pp. 107-121, (2017); Beegum, S.

This is particularly evident in the Mediterranean, where intense tourism development and coastalization continuously impose urban land pressures on agricultural areas and natural land. In the present study a set of 14 coastal medium-sized cities of Spain, Italy, Greece, Mediterranean France and Malta is used to explore recent urban sprawl trends and to analyze different typologies of urban form and structure. Based on recent data from European databases (Urban Atlas, Corine Land Cover and the Imperviousness-Soil Sealing Degree dataset), soil sealing degree profiles are estimated and the distribution of different urban land uses is analyzed for year 2006 using a set of spatial metrics. Urban growth between 1990 and 2014 is estimated based on data from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL). Results reveal important differences between the cities in terms of urban form and structure. Geomorphology, different levels of population growth and tourism development, differences in the historical and socioeconomic context constitute among others, the reasons for this differentiation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coastalization; Land Use; Medium-sized Cities; Soil Sealing; Urban Form; Urban Sprawl","","","","The present work is part of the postdoc research accomplished under the framework of “Financial assistance for Postdoc researchers”, of the EU Programm “Workforce Development, Education and Continuing Education”, 2014-2020, under the lead of IKY and co-financed through the European Social Fund and the Greek State.","Aguilera-Benavente, Francisco, Landscape metrics in the analysis of urban land use patterns: A case study in a Spanish metropolitan area, Landscape and Urban Planning, 99, 3-4, pp. 226-238, (2011); Arapoglou, Vassilis P., New facets of urban segregation in Southern Europe: Gender, migration and social class change in Athens, European Urban and Regional Studies, 16, 4, pp. 345-362, (2009); Archibugi, Franco, Rome: A new planning strategy, pp. 1-189, (2005); Barbero-Sierra, Celia, The case of urban sprawl in Spain as an active and irreversible driving force for desertification, Journal of Arid Environments, 90, pp. 95-102, (2013); Chorianopoulos, I., Planning, competitiveness and sprawl in the Mediterranean city: The case of Athens, Cities, 27, 4, pp. 249-259, (2010); Urban Sprawl in Europe Landscapes Land Use Change and Policy, (2007); Catalán, Bibiana, Urban sprawl in the Mediterranean?.

The empirical analysis is based on the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) dataset. The data were stratified by altimetry zone and farm size. Descriptive statistics and the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for each group were used. The main results show how the Second Pillar has mainly supported small and medium-sized farms with tourism activities and located in disadvantaged areas.

A total of 114 nations (58% of the total nations in the world) and two international organizations, including the European Union (EU) and Codex (WHO) have regulated at least one of the most currently used pesticides in at least one of the most consumed agricultural commodities. In this study, 14 of the most commonly used pesticides and 12 of the most commonly consumed agricultural commodities were identified and selected for analysis. A health risk analysis indicated that nearly 30% of the computed pesticide TMDI values were greater than the acceptable daily intake (ADI) values; however, many nations lack common pesticide MRLs in many commonly consumed foods and other human exposure pathways, such as soil, water, and air were not considered. Normality tests of the TMDI values set indicated that all distributions had a right skewness due to large TMDI clusters at the low end of the distribution, which were caused by some strict pesticide MRLs regulated by the EU (normally a default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg when essential data are missing). The Box-Cox transformation and optimal lambda (λ) were applied to these TMDI distributions, and normality tests of the transformed data set indicated that the power transformed TMDI values of at least eight pesticides presented a normal distribution. It was concluded that unifying strict pesticide MRLs by nations worldwide could significantly skew the distribution of TMDI values to the right, lower the legal exposure to pesticide, and effectively control human health risks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Good Agricultural Practice; Human Health Risk Assessment; Maximum Residue Limit (mrl); Pesticide; Public Health; Glyphosate; Water; Pesticide Residues; Pesticides; Glyphosate; Pesticide; Water; Pesticide Residue; Agricultural Practice; Atmospheric Pollution; European Union; Food Intake; Health Risk; International Organization; Pollution Exposure; Public Health; Risk Assessment; Soil Pollution; Water Pollution; Air; Article; Environmental Exposure; Evaluation Study; Food Contamination; Government Regulation; Health Hazard; Human; Maximum Residue Limit; Residue Analysis; Soil; Theoretical Study; Food; Risk; Food; Food Contamination; Humans; Pesticide Residues; Pesticides; Risk","glyphosate; pesticide; water; pesticide residue; agricultural practice; atmospheric pollution; European Union; food intake; health risk; international organization; pollution exposure; public health; risk assessment; soil pollution; water pollution; air; Article; environmental exposure; evaluation study; food contamination; government regulation; health hazard; human; maximum residue limit; residue analysis; soil; theoretical study; food; risk; Food; Food Contamination; Humans; Pesticide Residues; Pesticides; Risk","","glyphosate, 1071-83-6; water, 7732-18-5; Pesticide Residues; Pesticides","","undefined, (2012); Wasim Aktar, Md, Impact of pesticides use in agriculture: Their benefits and hazards, Interdisciplinary Toxicology, 2, 1, pp. 1-12, (2009); Ámbrus, Árpád, Global Harmonization of Maximum Residue Limits for Pesticides, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 64, 1, pp. 30-35, (2016); undefined, (2012); Australian Vegetable Growing Farms, (2012); undefined, (2012); undefined, (2013); Global MRL Database, (2017); undefined, (2010); undefined, (2010)","","Academic Press","","","","","","03014797; 10958630","","JEVMA","29747101","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046655086"

In this context, soil spectroscopy is a well-consolidated and widespread method to estimate soil variables, and in particular SOC content, at a low cost for routine analysis. The increasing number of large soil spectral libraries collected worldwide reflects the importance of spectroscopy in soil science. These large libraries contain soil samples derived from a large number of pedological regions and thus from different parent materials and soil types. In the light of the huge variation in the spectral responses to SOC content and composition, a rigorous process is necessary to subdivide large spectral libraries to avoid calibration with global models that fail to predict local variation in SOC content. Here, we propose to classify the European LUCAS topsoil database with a cluster analysis based on a large number of soil properties. The soil samples collected from arable land in the LUCAS database were chosen to apply a standardized multivariate calibration approach, valid for large areas, to calibrate local models without the need for further field and laboratory work. Cluster analysis detected seven soil classes and the samples belonging to each class were used to calibrate specific partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to estimate SOC content in three spectral libraries collected in Belgium and Luxembourg. Soil organic carbon was predicted with good accuracy, both within each library (root mean square error (RMSE), 1.2–5.1 g kg−1; ratio of performance to prediction (RPD), 1.41–2.24) and for the samples of the three libraries together (RMSE, 3.7 g kg−1; RPD, 2.54). The proposed approach could enable SOC to be estimated for arable soils in Europe with only the spectra of soil samples and without the need for laboratory analyses. Highlights: We investigated the potential of the LUCAS database to estimate SOC in spectral libraries. We proposed a routine approach to estimate SOC with less laboratory work. The classification of the LUCAS topsoil dataset improved estimation accuracy of SOC SOC content can be predicted from soil spectra with models calibrated on the LUCAS database. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accuracy Assessment; Agricultural Soil; Calibration; Cluster Analysis; Database; Estimation Method; Multivariate Analysis; Organic Carbon; Pedology; Regression Analysis; Soil Carbon; Soil Property; Soil Type; Topsoil; Belgium; Europe; Luxembourg [belgium]","accuracy assessment; agricultural soil; calibration; cluster analysis; database; estimation method; multivariate analysis; organic carbon; pedology; regression analysis; soil carbon; soil property; soil type; topsoil; Belgium; Europe; Luxembourg [Belgium]","","","Funding text 1: The research was funded by the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO) as part of the PROSOIL project ‘The evaluation of forthcoming satellites for mapping topsoil organic carbon in croplands’ (Contract NR SR /10/327) and by the Service Public de Wallonie as part of the Carbiosol project.

This is a high priority given its importance for consumers, public policy and private industry. Data collection programmes will need to adapt their scope if their information is to adequately address new information needs about high-level objectives. Assessment of sustainability at the farm level is hindered by the lack of data with which to derive appropriate, meaningful, and relevant indicators. This is particularly problematic for assessment of agricultural sustainability across the European Union (EU). Various databases exist at the EU scale regarding agricultural data sources and we identify one of these, the EU Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), as having considerable potential to assess farm-level sustainability at EU level. We critique several examples of published work that has attempted to assess agricultural sustainability using: FADN data alone; FADN data in combination with data from supplementary surveys, and; FADN data in combination with data from other EU databases. We conclude that the FADN would need to broaden its scope of data collection if it is to address the new information needs of policy, and we discuss the challenges in expanding FADN with a view towards wider farm-level assessment of sustainability. These include careful selection of indicators based on various criteria, the representativeness of the FADN, and the need to include new themes to address environmental, social, and animal welfare effects of policy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","European Union; Farm Accountancy Data Network; Indicators; Rural Development Programme; Sustainability; Agriculture; Data Acquisition; Regional Planning; Agricultural Sustainability; Data Collection; Data Network; Development Programmes; European Union; Farm Accountancy Data Network; Network Data; Rural Development; Rural Development Program; Sustainability Indicators; Sustainable Development; Accountability; Agricultural Policy; Alternative Agriculture; Animal Welfare; Data Assimilation; Database; European Union; Rural Development; Sustainability; Animalia","Agriculture; Data acquisition; Regional planning; Agricultural sustainability; Data collection; Data network; Development programmes; European union; Farm accountancy data network; Network data; Rural development; Rural development program; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable development; accountability; agricultural policy; alternative agriculture; animal welfare; data assimilation; database; European Union; rural development; sustainability; Animalia","","","This work was partly funded by the FLINT project under the EU Seventh Framework Programme grant number 613800 .

Remote sensing data from the European Space Agency (ESA) derived soil moisture and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) evapotranspiration have been used to compare the model simulated soil moisture and evapotranspiration at daily scale. It is found that the ESA derived soil moisture and MODIS evapotranspiration are closer to model simulated soil moisture and evapotranspiration respectively. RMS error of 0.07–0.17 m3 m− 3 is noted in model simulated soil moisture for each station and RMS error of 60–100 mm is noticed in model simulated evapotranspiration over each station.

Along with the high demand locally, the industry successfully penetrated the international market. However, the Malaysia’s ornamental fish industry started to face an embargo on exports made by the European Union (EU) in 2015. The study was conducted to solve the issue of import restrictions by establishing the compartment system, using GIS and remote sensing. A total sample population comprised of 19 ornamental fish farmers in Layang-layang, Kluang. The data sources used in this study were based on non-spatial data (survey), spatial data (GIS) and image satellite data to capture farm location effect on the farm operational activities. The descriptive analysis was used to describe the respondent’s socio-economic profile and relationship between farming participation and independent variables identified were cross-tabulated. Spot-6 images was used to determine the spatial characteristics to farming activities in distinctive regions. Majority of the farmers were male and married and at (36.8%) aged more than 40 years old. Results shows the highest number of the people who had participated in secondary education level were SPM holders with 41.6%, majority of 7 (36.8%) respondents had a scale more than 10ha of farm size and average total of 2 millions of production a year. Most of them breed goldfish (29%) and tiger barb (8%). Age, education level, total of production and income have a significant relationship with farm participation. Spatially, the results showed that 52.6% of the farmers live near the town which in Kluang, less than fifteen (15) kilometres away from their house and farm.

This study examines how the rural areas entrepreneurship spirit can be stimulated through increasing awareness in regards to the environmental impact of green activities. The aim is to find ways of converting the rural traditional economy into a sustainable one by creating different types of initiatives for the population such as organic farming, renewal energy alternatives, eco-tourism and reducing food waste. The research is based on data extracted from European Union reports, Eurostat Database and National Statistical Institute of Romania, Poland, Spain and Italy. The studies track the number of registered green farmers that operate in the European Union. Even though agriculture is highly unbalanced in Romania and is far behind countries like Spain, Italy and Poland, organic farming and green activities might save and add value to the sector. In the considered period we can notice an increase in the organic farming in Italy and Spain and a decrease in Poland and Romania. The decrease is caused by the fact that, in the past few years, due to the low price of agricultural land, small farms were bought by the larger ones. These practice industrial farming due to the high efficiency and by default high profits. As the environment is the base for all the economic activities we must find ways of achieving a balance between the economic well-being and environmental protection for a sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Entrepreneurship; Green Economy; Organic Farming; Rural Areas; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Economics; Environmental Protection; Food Waste; Sustainable Development; Agricultural Land; Economic Activities; Entrepreneurship; Green Economies; High-efficiency; National Statistical Institutes; Organic Farming; Small Business; Rural Areas","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Economics; Environmental protection; Food waste; Sustainable development; Agricultural land; Economic activities; Entrepreneurship; Green economies; High-efficiency; National Statistical Institutes; Organic farming; Small business; Rural areas","","","Agriculture is the primary role of action where the states members of the European Union assume both responsibility and funding, actions that lead the European Union as a whole to manage financial support and not to each country.","undefined; Editura Tribuna Economica Romania, (2011); Naldi, Lucia, What is smart rural development?, Journal of Rural Studies, 40, pp. 90-101, (2015); Bucharest World Bank P; Harvard Business Review, (1979); Romania, (2019); undefined; Editura Expert Romania, (2011); Romania Rural Development Strategy; undefined","","International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference","","18th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference, SGEM 2018","","Albena","142873","13142704","9786197603200; 9786197603323; 9786197105810; 9786197105049; 9786197105582; 978-619-7105-01-8; 9786197408423; 9786197603743; 9786197105186; 9786197408270","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058892540"

This has a major impact on food safety as food chains have become increasingly complex. This paper studies the benefits and drawback from a globalization standpoint regarding food safety in the developing countries and aims to find ways that might overcome the challenges consumers deal with. The research is based on data extracted from European Union reports, Eurostat Database, International Trade Centre Database and Romanian National Institute of Statistics. The study presents an overview on foods balance trade in the European Union with emphasis on the developing countries. It can be observed that in the considered period we can notice a high increase in imports and exports especially if we consider foods. In Romania, the exports of raw agricultural materials register an ascendant trend as well as the imports of processed foods. There are two main factors: large manufacturing enterprises disappeared in the last 20 years and the second one is due to the fact that more and more agricultural land is bought by the foreigners, the production is sold on the international market. Even though the globalization process involves all the countries worldwide, the impact is different on each, especially in the type of agriculture they practice due to the fact that the conflict between industrialization and ecological systems is emphasized. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Codex Alimentarius; Developing Countries; Globalization; International Trade; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Developing Countries; Ecology; Food Safety; Manufacture; Agricultural Land; Codex Alimentarius; Ecological Systems; European Union; Globalisation; Globalization; International Markets; Manufacturing Enterprise; International Trade","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Developing countries; Ecology; Food safety; Manufacture; Agricultural land; Codex Alimentarius; Ecological systems; European union; Globalisation; Globalization; International markets; Manufacturing enterprise; International trade","","","","World Library and Information Congress 73rd Ifla General Conference and Council Durban South Africa, (2007); United States Pine George United States, (2013); Mormont, Marc, Globalization and the ""ecologization"" of rural areas, Etudes Rurales, 183, 1, pp. 143-160, (2009); Cultural Geographies, (2010); Romania, (2013); Food and Agriculture Organization Reports Globalization of Food Systems in Developing Countries Impact on Food Security and Nutrition, (2013); Romania, (2013); J Child Nutr Manag, (2002); undefined; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development","","International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference","","18th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference, SGEM 2018","","Albena","142873","13142704","9786197603200; 9786197603323; 9786197105810; 9786197105049; 9786197105582; 978-619-7105-01-8; 9786197408423; 9786197603743; 9786197105186; 9786197408270","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058875048"

The aim of the study is twofold: 1) to ascertain the concepts and options for ecosystem services, particularly, agro-ecosystem services, valuation; and 2) to assess the supporting activities, based on implementation effectiveness analysis of Rural Development Program's (RDP) 2007-2013 agri-environmental measures in Latvia. The principal materials used for the studies are as follows: different sources of literature, e.g. scholars' articles, research papers and the reports of institutions, inter alia, European Union; the data from Eurostat database, Central Statistical Bureau database and unpublished data from database of Latvian Rural Support Service. For investigation of impact of agricultural landscape sustainability aspects the following data were used: payment agri-environment measures'; and commitment area of agricultural land or area, as well as the structure of crop areas. The data that have been used reflect implementation of agri-environment measures under RDP 2007-2013. The suitable qualitative and quantitative research methods for certain tasks have been used in the process of study. The findings show that the expected positive effect of implementation of agri-environmental measures of RDP 2007-2013 in Latvia on the sustainability and resilience of agricultural landscapes, as a provider of main ecosystem services, as well as conservation of agricultural biodiversity has not been received. Besides, in order to investigate the further effectiveness of state support for ecosystem services, the assessment of planned agri-environmental measures of new RDP 2014-2020 is performed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Agro-ecosystem; Ecosystem Services; Valuation; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Database Systems; Regional Planning; Resource Valuation; Rural Areas; Sustainable Development; Agricultural Biodiversity; Agricultural Land; Agricultural Landscapes; Agro Ecosystems; Ecosystem Services; Effectiveness Analysis; Environmental Measures; Quantitative Research Methods; Ecosystems","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Database systems; Regional planning; Resource valuation; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Agricultural biodiversity; Agricultural land; Agricultural landscapes; Agro ecosystems; Ecosystem services; Effectiveness analysis; Environmental measures; Quantitative research methods; Ecosystems","","","This research was supported by the National Research Program „Innovation and Sustainable Development” (SUSTINNO).","Bouwma, Irene M., Adoption of the ecosystem services concept in EU policies, Ecosystem Services, 29, pp. 213-222, (2018); Andersen, Erling, The farming system component of European agricultural landscapes, European Journal of Agronomy, 82, pp. 282-291, (2017); Ecosystems and Human Well Being Synthesis, (2005); Bennett, Elena M., Linking biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being: three challenges for designing research for sustainability, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 14, pp. 76-85, (2015); Maes, Joachim, An indicator framework for assessing ecosystem services in support of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, Ecosystem Services, 17, pp. 14-23, (2016); Tancoigne, Élise, The place of agricultural sciences in the literature on ecosystem services, Ecosystem Services, 10, pp. 35-48, (2014); Daniel, Terry C., Contributions of cultural services to the ecosystem services agenda, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 109, 23, pp. 8812-8819, (2012); Duru, Michel, How to implement biodiversity-based agriculture to enhance ecosystem services: a review, Agronomy for Sustainable Development, 35, 4, pp. 1259-1281, (2015); Provision of Public Goods Through Agriculture in the European Union, (2009); Rural Development and Land Use, (2012)","","Latvia University of Agriculture Aigars.Laizans@llu.lv","","17th International Scientific Conference Engineering for Rural Development, ERD 2018","","Jelgava","137032","16915976; 16913043","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048990021"

During the study, 213857 agroecosystems were evaluated referring to their capacity to maintain pollinators, natural pest control, soil quality and atmospheric carbon sequestration. The capacity of agroecosystems to provide the above mentioned ecosystem services was ranged from moderate to very high, tending the mountainous agroecosystems to be more beneficial than that located in the plains and lowlands.

In this work some preliminary results are presented concerning geometric and spectral consistency of the two compared datasets. Tests were performed specifically focusing on the agriculture-devoted part of Piemonte Region (NW Italy). Geometric consistencies of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 datasets were tested “absolutely” (in respect of a selected reference frame) and “relatively” (one in respect of the other) by selecting, respectively, 160 and 100 well distributed check points. Spectral differences affecting at-the-ground reflectance were tested after images calibration performed by dark object subtraction approach. A special focus was on differences affecting derivable NDVI and NDWI spectral indices, being the most widely used in the agriculture remote sensing application context.

In this context, the European Union considers agriculture a key sector of the economy, recognizing, however, the related environmental implications. The aim of this paper is to examine the agricultural efficiency of EU countries, through a bootstrap-Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach, an effective nonparametric method for evaluating the relative efficiency of the decision-making units. European datasets, suitable for policies and focused on the integration between agricultural productivity and ecosystem services (ESs) conservation, have been used to support planners and managers. Data related to five inputs (labor, land, capital, fertilizers, and irrigation area) and to one output connected to the economic value of agricultural production were collected from 1993 to 2013. The results show that the majority of EU countries have been experiencing increasing or decreasing returns to scale, highlighting their potential to increase their production efficiency by modifying their input use. Both for the output-oriented approach and the input-oriented approach, the majority of EU countries could better rationalize their input use obtaining more outputs and achieving production efficiency. DEA, a non-parametric methodology has been applied, using the concept of a reference group of efficient decision-making units that produce a similar output (peer group). Input-oriented and output-oriented DEA results and comparison indicate that most of the oldest EU countries have a more efficient and optimized crop production process in terms of resource savings and output maximization. This is probably due to the application of the Common Agricultural Policy. Therefore, in policy planning but also in management decisions, attention should always be paid not only to the maximization of agricultural production, but also to the environmental resource overexploitation. In this sense, best agricultural practices could represent a model to follow because they can maintain ESs without depressing production by using practices like conservation tillage, crop diversification, legume intensification and biological control perform giving the same results as intensive, high-input systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Efficiency; Bootstrap-dea; Common Agricultural Policy; Ecosystem Services; Environmental Planning And Management; Crops; Cultivation; Data Envelopment Analysis; Decision Making; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Environmental Management; Environmental Protection; Productivity; Soil Conservation; Water Management; Agricultural Efficiency; Bootstrap-dea; Common Agricultural Policy; Ecosystem Services; Environmental Planning; Agriculture; Agricultural Ecosystem; Agricultural Intensification; Agricultural Practice; Agricultural Production; Biological Control; Common Agricultural Policy; Crop Production; Data Envelopment Analysis; Ecosystem Service; Environmental Management; Environmental Planning; Environmental Policy; European Union; Legume","Crops; Cultivation; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Productivity; Soil conservation; Water management; Agricultural efficiency; Bootstrap-DEA; Common agricultural policy; Ecosystem services; Environmental planning; Agriculture; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural intensification; agricultural practice; agricultural production; biological control; Common Agricultural Policy; crop production; data envelopment analysis; ecosystem service; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental policy; European Union; legume","","","","Agricultural Economics Review, (2005); Int J Agric Res, (2008); Atici, Kazim Baris, Using data envelopment analysis for the assessment of technical efficiency of units with different specialisations: An application to agriculture, Omega (United Kingdom), 54, pp. 72-83, (2015); Samad Azad, Md Abdus, Measuring environmental efficiency of agricultural water use: A Luenberger environmental indicator, Journal of Environmental Management, 145, pp. 314-320, (2014); Badin, Luiza, How to measure the impact of environmental factors in a nonparametric production model, European Journal of Operational Research, 223, 3, pp. 818-833, (2012); Balcombe, Kelvin G., An application of the DEA double bootstrap to examine sources of efficiency in Bangladesh rice farming, Applied Economics, 40, 15, pp. 1919-1925, (2008); Banker, Rajiv D., SOME MODELS FOR ESTIMATING TECHNICAL AND SCALE INEFFICIENCIES IN DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS., Management Science, 30, 9, pp. 1078-1092, (1984); Reaping the Benefits Science and the Sustainable Intensification of Global Agriculture, (2025); Bojnec, Štefan, Determinants of technical efficiency in agriculture in new EU member states from Central and Eastern Europe, Acta Oeconomica, 64, 2, pp. 197-217, (2014); Bommarco, Riccardo, Ecological intensification: Harnessing ecosystem services for food security, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 28, 4, pp. 230-238, (2013)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","1470160X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026836330"

Notwithstanding, whilst the CAP has become more environmental and socially responsible, it is still expected to deliver an efficient farm production system capable of competing on world markets. The current paper combines a farm business panel dataset for 98 EU territories with a Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) approach, to assess the impact of four contemporary broad categories of CAP subsidy programs on efficiency and environmental sustainability. In accordance with the literature, this study more correctly defines inputs as “facilitating”, whilst following recent methodological developments, crop-subsidies are treated as an endogenous strategic variable in the production function. Comparing between two discrete time periods, further tests are conducted to examine the hypothesis of technical efficiency convergence across european territories. The results suggest that first pillar crop subsidies and pillar two environmental programs generate a disincentive effect on productivity, whilst in general, the CAP promotes technical efficiency convergence within Europe. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cap; Environmental Subsidies; Eu; Productivity; Technical Efficiency Convergence; Agricultural Production; Common Agricultural Policy; European Union; Subsidy System; Technical Efficiency; Europe","agricultural production; Common Agricultural Policy; European Union; subsidy system; technical efficiency; Europe","","","","Economic Growth, (1995); Battese, George E., Functional Forms of Stochastic Frontier Production Functions and Models for Technical Inefficiency Effects: A Comparative Study for Wheat Farmers in Pakistan, Journal of Productivity Analysis, 8, 4, pp. 395-414, (1997); Battese, George E., A model for technical inefficiency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data, Empirical Economics, 20, 2, pp. 325-332, (1995); Beck, Nathaniel L., Modeling dynamics in time-series-cross-section political economy data, Annual Review of Political Science, 14, pp. 331-352, (2011); Farm Accounting Data Network an A to Z of Methodology, (2010); Innovating for Sustainable Growth A Bioeconomy for Europe, (2012); Agriculture Towards 2015 30, (2000); Gaál, Márta, Potential impacts of climate change on agricultural land use suitability of the Hungarian counties, Regional Environmental Change, 14, 2, pp. 597-610, (2014); Am J Agric Econ, (2006); Zhengfei, Guan, Integrating agronomic principles into production function specification: A dichotomy of growth inputs and facilitating inputs, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 88, 1, pp. 203-214, (2006)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","02648377","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027284254"

All geographical Europe is included, plus Mediterranean areas of the Middle East and North Africa. The climatic parameters available include temperature (daily minima and maxima), solar radiation, rainfall and relative humidity. As well as the potential for use in simple pest models, selected parameters can be imported into more complex models, such as CLIMEX, for more detailed analyses.

On the spatial scale typically used in terrestrial ecosystem models (0.5 or 1°) changes in LUC over time periods of a few years or more can include bidirectional changes on the sub-grid level, such as the parallel expansion and abandonment of agricultural land (e.g. in shifting cultivation) or cropland-grassland conversion (and vice versa). These complex changes between classes within a grid cell have often been neglected in previous studies, and only net changes of land between natural vegetation cover, cropland and pastures accounted for, mainly because of a lack of reliable high-resolution historical information on gross land transitions, in combination with technical limitations within the models themselves. In the present study we applied a state-of-The-Art dynamic global vegetation model with a detailed representation of croplands and carbon-nitrogen dynamics to quantify the uncertainty in terrestrial ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes arising from the choice between net and gross representations of LUC. We used three frequently applied global, one recent global and one recent European LUC datasets, two of which resolve gross land transitions, either in Europe or in certain tropical regions. When considering only net changes, land-use-Transition uncertainties (expressed as 1 standard deviation around decadal means of four models) in global carbon emissions from LUC (ELUC) are ±0.19, ±0.66 and ±0.47gCa1 in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, respectively, or between 14 and 39% LUC. Carbon stocks at the end of the 20th century vary by ±11 PgC for vegetation and ±37PgC for soil C due to the choice of LUC reconstruction, i.e. around 3% of the respective C pools. Accounting for sub-grid (gross) land conversions significantly increased the effect of LUC on global and European carbon stocks and fluxes, most noticeably enhancing global cumulative ELUC by 33PgC(1750-2014) and entailing a significant reduction in carbon stored in vegetation, although the effect on soil C stocks was limited. Simulations demonstrated that assessments of historical carbon stocks and fluxes are highly uncertain due to the choice of LUC reconstruction and that the consideration of different contrasting LUC reconstructions is needed to account for this uncertainty. The analysis of gross, in addition to net, land-use changes showed that the full complexity of gross land-use changes is required in order to accurately predict the magnitude of LUC change emissions. This introduces technical challenges to process-based models and relies on extensive information regarding historical land-use transitions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Atmospheric Chemistry; Climate Change; Cultivation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Repair; Vegetation; Climate Change Mitigation; Global Carbon Emission; Historical Information; Land Use And Land Cover; Shifting Cultivations; Technical Challenges; Technical Limitations; Terrestrial Ecosystems; Land Use; Atmospheric Chemistry; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Climate Change; Concentration (composition); Ecosystem Modeling; Land Use Change; Reconstruction; Terrestrial Ecosystem","Agriculture; Atmospheric chemistry; Climate change; Cultivation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Repair; Vegetation; Climate change mitigation; Global carbon emission; Historical information; Land use and land cover; Shifting cultivations; Technical challenges; Technical limitations; Terrestrial ecosystems; Land use; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; concentration (composition); ecosystem modeling; land use change; reconstruction; terrestrial ecosystem","","","","Ahlström, Anders, Robustness and uncertainty in terrestrial ecosystem carbon response to CMIP5 climate change projections, Environmental Research Letters, 7, 4, (2012); Arora, V.

At first, BSA-AuNCs were prepared using a photo stable fluorescent substrate. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI) to produce thiocholine (TCh), and the sulfhydryl groups (SH-) on TCh form Au-S bonds with BSA-AuNCs; thus, the fluorescence of BSAAuNCs weakens. On the other hand, OPs can inhibit the activity of AChE, thus preventing the generation of TCh, and the fluorescence recovery of BSA-AuNCs occurs. Under optimized experimental conditions, parathion-methyl (PM) was detected in the concentration range of 0.33-6.67 ng mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.14 ng mL-1 (S/N = 3), which is much lower than the maximum residue limits reported in the European Union pesticides database as well as that defined by the U.S. Department Agriculture. Moreover, the assay demonstrated highly sensitive applications in the quantitative determination of OPs in water and food samples. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fluorescence; Gold; Multilayers; Nanoclusters; Pesticides; Probes; Concentration Ranges; Experimental Conditions; Fluorescence Recovery; Maximum Residue Limits; Organophos-phorus Pesticides; Protected Gold Nanoclusters; Quantitative Determinations; Sensitive Application; Gold Compounds","Fluorescence; Gold; Multilayers; Nanoclusters; Pesticides; Probes; Concentration ranges; Experimental conditions; Fluorescence recovery; Maximum residue limits; Organophos-phorus pesticides; Protected gold nanoclusters; Quantitative determinations; Sensitive application; Gold compounds","","","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21765015 to P.

The identification of NO<inf>3</inf>− sources is critical to efficiently control or reverse NO<inf>3</inf>− contamination that affects many aquifers. In that respect, the use of stable isotope ratios 15N/14N and 18O/16O in NO<inf>3</inf>− (expressed as δ15N-NO<inf>3</inf>− and δ18O-NO<inf>3</inf>−, respectively) has long shown its value. However, limitations exist in complex environments where multiple nitrogen (N) sources coexist. This two-year study explores a method for improved NO<inf>3</inf>− source investigation in a shallow unconfined aquifer with mixed N inputs and a long established NO<inf>3</inf>− problem. In this tillage-dominated area of free-draining soil and subsoil, suspected NO<inf>3</inf>− sources were diffuse applications of artificial fertiliser and organic point sources (septic tanks and farmyards). Bearing in mind that artificial diffuse sources were ubiquitous, groundwater samples were first classified according to a combination of two indicators relevant of point source contamination: presence/absence of organic point sources (i.e. septic tank and/or farmyard) near sampling wells and exceedance/non-exceedance of a contamination threshold value for sodium (Na+) in groundwater. This classification identified three contamination groups: agricultural diffuse source but no point source (D+P−), agricultural diffuse and point source (D+P+) and agricultural diffuse but point source occurrence ambiguous (D+P±). Thereafter δ15N-NO<inf>3</inf>− and δ18O-NO<inf>3</inf>− data were superimposed on the classification. As δ15N-NO<inf>3</inf>− was plotted against δ18O-NO<inf>3</inf>−, comparisons were made between the different contamination groups. Overall, both δ variables were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.0001, r<inf>s</inf> = 0.599, slope of 0.5), which was indicative of denitrification. An inspection of the contamination groups revealed that denitrification did not occur in the absence of point source contamination (group D+P-). In fact, strong significant denitrification lines occurred only in the D+P+ and D+P± groups (p < 0.0001, r<inf>s</inf> > 0.6, 0.53 ≤ slope ≤ 0.76), i.e. where point source contamination was characterised or suspected. These lines originated from the 2–6‰ range for δ15N-NO<inf>3</inf>−, which suggests that i) NO<inf>3</inf>− contamination was dominated by an agricultural diffuse N source (most likely the large organic matter pool that has incorporated 15N-depleted nitrogen from artificial fertiliser in agricultural soils and whose nitrification is stimulated by ploughing and fertilisation) rather than point sources and ii) denitrification was possibly favoured by high dissolved organic content (DOC) from point sources. Combining contamination indicators and a large stable isotope dataset collected over a large study area could therefore improve our understanding of the NO<inf>3</inf>− contamination processes in groundwater for better land use management.

The aim of this study is to inquire into the impacts that excessive intensification has on productivity and environmental costs in the long term and additionally, to explore empirically the trend of these two indicators over time. The contribution of this paper is to perform an empirical study of the trends of productivity and environmental costs of farming in the long-term. To this end, this paper performs a panel data analysis of productivity and environmental costs on a farm accounting database across European regions over the 1989–2009 period. The models proposed take (i) farm output per hectare as indicator of productivity, and (ii) expenditures on energy, pesticides and fertilisers per hectare as proxy indicators of environmental costs. Results provide empirical evidence that the regions under study have a negative trend of productivity and a positive trend of environmental costs over the time frame mentioned. These results correlate negatively with both, economic and environmental sustainability of farms. Arguably, this is aggravated in the latter due to hidden environmental costs valued at zero in traditional accounting. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy; European Agriculture; Fertilisers; Pesticides; Productivity; Sustainability Accounting; Cost Accounting; Costs; Data Handling; Fertilizers; Information Analysis; Pesticides; Productivity; Sustainable Development; Economic Consequences; Empirical Studies; Energy; Environmental Costs; Environmental Sustainability; European Agriculture; European Regions; Panel Data Analysis; Cost Benefit Analysis","Cost accounting; Costs; Data handling; Fertilizers; Information analysis; Pesticides; Productivity; Sustainable development; Economic consequences; Empirical studies; Energy; Environmental costs; Environmental sustainability; European agriculture; European regions; Panel data analysis; Cost benefit analysis","","","The authors are thankful to the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions, which have resulted in a considerable improvement of this manuscript.

For this, data from the Eurostat (Several statistics.

However this practice requires assessing the equivalence between datasets and, if needed, applying data leveling to correct possible biases between datasets. Here we propose two original methods for assessing equivalence and for leveling data when datasets contain records that are located within the same perimeter. The first method is designed for datasets that are similarly spatially distributed and is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and quantile regression. The second method does not require datasets to be similarly spatially distributed and is based on prior knowledge about the factors explaining the geochemical concentrations and on BLS (Bivariate Least Squares) regression. The scope of application, pros, cons and detailed practical recommendations are presented for each method. Both methods were applied to a case study involving Fe, V and Y datasets originating from two European geochemical mapping projects: the Geochemical Mapping of Agricultural Soils of Europe (GEMAS) and the Baltic Soil Survey (BSS).

Emissions from European agriculture have been reduced, albeit at the expense of crop yield and the risk of production displacement (the transfer of production, and associated emissions, to land outside of Europe). This article assesses the impact on GHG emissions of selected European Rural Development Program measures, representative of a diversity of management strategies implemented on cultivated land, within nine European Member States. Climatic zone and underlying spatial environmental variables were accounted for using a novel technique, “Regional Variation Categories,” developed with European-scale GIS data sets. Production displacement is assessed with two benchmarks: (1) compared with existing crop production and (2) relative to a “minimum requirement” land management scenario, where an emissions reduction of less than this does not constitute mitigation. Most measures reduce emissions relative to the baseline crop scenario; however, many do not reduce emissions beyond the “minimum requirement,” this being limited to measures such as catch crops and within-field grass areas to prevent soil erosion. The selection and targeting of measures to maximize agricultural GHG mitigation on cultivated land within Europe is discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Leakage; Mitigation Measures; Nitrous Oxide; Rural Development; Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Emission Control; Gas Emissions; Land Use; Leakage (fluid); Nitrogen Oxides; Regional Planning; Rural Areas; Emissions Reduction; Environmental Variables; European Agriculture; Management Strategies; Minimum Requirements; Mitigation Measures; Nitrous Oxide; Rural Development; Greenhouse Gases","Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Emission control; Gas emissions; Land use; Leakage (fluid); Nitrogen oxides; Regional planning; Rural areas; Emissions reduction; Environmental variables; European agriculture; Management strategies; Minimum requirements; Mitigation measures; Nitrous oxide; Rural development; Greenhouse gases","","","European Commission [grant number 071201/2011/609681/SER/CLIMA.A.2]","Europe 2020 A Strategy for Smart Sustainable and Inclusive Growth, (2010); Proposal for A Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Support for Rural Development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development Eafrd, (2011); Yamulki, Sirwan, Short-term effects of tillage and compaction on nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, methane and carbon dioxide fluxes from grassland, Biology and Fertility of Soils, 36, 3, pp. 224-231, (2002); International Fertiliser Society Proceedings, (2001); Tzilivakis, John, An assessment of the energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) production in the UK, Agricultural Systems, 85, 2, pp. 101-119, (2005); Tzilivakis, John, Environmental impact and economic assessment for UK sugar beet production systems, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 107, 4, pp. 341-358, (2005); Environmental Burdens of Agricultural and Horticultural Commodity Production Lca Is0205 Version 3, (2009); Bunnell, Fred L., Microbial respiration and substrate weight loss-I.

As this activity is recognized in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), reporting on LULUC is an integral part of annual GHG inventories required from Annex I countries under the convention. In order to improve LULUC reporting, countries are shifting from national statistical data to high resolution spatial datasets. One such dataset is the Land-Parcel Information System (LPIS), an administrative spatial database developed to assist farmers and authorities assessing land eligibility for agricultural subsidies as part of the European Union's (EU) Common Agricultural Policy.Using the LPIS of the Republic of Ireland as a case study, we demonstrated significant differences in cropland/grassland reporting between an inter-annual based reporting schema and a land-use history approach. Twelve years of national LPIS data were analyzed to explore the dynamics between croplands and non-croplands. Major underlying cropland dynamics were identified with large areas changing between croplands and non-croplands even though annual total cropland areas were relatively stable over this period. Furthermore, we showed that in the 12 year study period, 69.8. ±. 10.7% of the area leaving cropland each year returned to cropland within the following five years. Following the EU Common Agricultural Policy definition, these areas count as temporary grassland, which according to IPCC reporting guidelines should be reported as cropland. In an example utilizing three different LULUC reporting methodologies (total area based, land-parcel based, and land-use history based) to assess changes in cropland and grassland areas for the 2008-2012 GHG commitment period, not including land-use history led to an underestimation of cropland by 45.7% as well as an associated error in land-use change assessment. We therefore demonstrate good practice for accurately measuring cropland conversions under current IPCC guidelines using multi annual LPIS records. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Cropland Dynamics; Land-parcel Identification System (lpis); Land-use/land-use Change; Republic Of Ireland; Temporary Grasslands; Annual Variation; Climate Change; Common Agricultural Policy; Comparative Study; European Union; Land Use Change; Land Use Planning; Ireland","annual variation; climate change; Common Agricultural Policy; comparative study; European Union; land use change; land use planning; Ireland","","","We would like to thank the Department for Agriculture, Forestry and the Marine for kindly allowing the use of the LPIS data Ireland.

The amount of N in excreta mainly depends on the animal category and productivity, and on feed use and management. National inventories of emissions to the environment are often based on different methodologies for the estimation of N excretion. Here, we present a transparent and uniform methodology for estimating annual feed use and N excretion per animal category for all countries of the EU-27, based on the energy and protein requirements of the animals and statistics of feed use and composition, animal number and productivity.The calculated total feed use in the EU-27 was 506Tg dry mass in 2010. Dairy cows used 29%, other cattle 34%, pigs 17%, chicken 9%, sheep and goats 8%, and other animal categories 3% of the total feed use. Grass and annual forages were mainly used by dairy cows (30 and 49%, respectively) and other cattle (55 and 44%); pigs used most of the feed cereals (53%); protein-rich feed (e.g., soybean meal) were mostly used by pigs (34%) and chicken (24%). Differences between countries in feed use were large, mainly related to variations in national feed supply and animal productivity. Total N excretion of the animals amounted to 9.7Tg in 2010, and varied between countries from 14 to 291kgha-1 of utilized agricultural land. The present study provides a uniform and transparent approach for evaluating feed use and N excretion in all countries of the EU-27. Our results underline the significant differences in N excretions between EU countries as a result of feed use variations, suggesting the need for basing N excretion estimations on feed use data. The dataset present in this study may serve as a basis for such efforts, also to improve national inventories of N emissions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Animal Feed; Cattle; Manure; Nitrogen Excretion; Pigs; Poultry; Ammonia; Artificial Diet; Cattle; Emission Inventory; European Union; Excretion; Livestock; Manure; Nitrate; Nitrous Oxide; Nutritional Requirement; Organic Nitrogen; Pig; Poultry; Animalia; Bos; Capra Hircus; Glycine Max; Ovis Aries; Suidae","ammonia; artificial diet; cattle; emission inventory; European Union; excretion; livestock; manure; nitrate; nitrous oxide; nutritional requirement; organic nitrogen; pig; poultry; Animalia; Bos; Capra hircus; Glycine max; Ovis aries; Suidae","","","This research has received funding from the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013/under REA grant agreement no. 289887.

In total, 664 Bulgarian and 1384 Romanian samples were collected which enabled a comparative assessment of topsoil properties under different land covers within, and between, these countries, as well as in a broader European context. The samples were analysed for basic soil properties, including particle size distribution, pH, organic carbon, carbonates, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and cation exchange capacity together with multispectral signatures. The current paper describes the LUCAS Topsoil 2012 project and provides both an overview of topsoil properties of cropland and grassland in Bulgaria and Romania, together with a comparative assessment with earlier findings with the analysis of data from other 25 EU Member States and data from small scale European soil database. Results show similarities with data from Member States with comparable climatic conditions in properties where non-anthropogenic soil forming factors play major role (texture, pH, calcium-carbonate, soil organic carbon content). There are considerable variations in certain soil properties between different land use types, (e.g. soil organic carbon content in croplands and grasslands in Romania; or potassium content in croplands and grassland in both countries). However, the most remarkable facts drawn from the current study are the very low phosphorus content in agricultural land in the two countries relative to other EU Member States, the significantly lower contents of organic carbon compared to modelled data of literature and legacy national data and the difference in the distribution of texture classes compared to European datasets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbonate; Land Use; Ph; Phosphorus; Potassium; Soil Organic Carbon","","","","","Arshad, Muhammad A.Charlie, Characterization of soil quality: Physical and chemical criteria, American Journal of Alternative Agriculture, 7, 1-2, pp. 25-31, (1992); Borůvka, Luboš, Forest soil acidification assessment using principal component analysis and geostatistics, Geoderma, 140, 4, pp. 374-382, (2007); Soil Resources of Europe, (1999); De Luca, Anna Irene, Multidisciplinary and innovative methodologies for sustainable management in agricultural systems, Environmental Engineering and Management Journal, 14, 7, pp. 1571-1581, (2015); Doran, John Walsh, Soil health and global sustainability: Translating science into practice, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 88, 2, pp. 119-127, (2002); Doran, John Walsh, Quantitative indicators of soil quality: A minimum data set, pp. 25-37, (2015); European Soil Database, (2004); Guidelines for Soil Description, (1990); Guide to Near Infrared Spectroscopic Analysis of Industrial Manufacturing Processes, (2009); Evaluation of Biosoil Demonstration Project Preliminary Data Analysis, (2010)","","Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania ccti@tuiasi.ro","","","","","","15829596","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028461569"

On the other hand, natural disaster occur at the locations where habitat was reduced due to the changes of land use, in which the land was converted to the settlements and agricultural cropland. Hence, habitat loss and natural disaster are linked closely. Ecological infrastructure is the nature-based equivalent of built or hard infrastructure, and is as important for providing services and underpinning socio-economic development. Hence, ecological infrastructure is expected to contribute to functioning as ecological disaster reduction, which is termed Ecosystem-based Solutions for Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR). Although ecological infrastructure already exists in the landscape, it might be degraded, needs to be maintained and managed, and in some cases restored. Maintenance and restoration of ecological infrastructure is important for security of human lives. Therefore, analytical tool and effective visualization tool in spatially explicit way for the past natural disaster and future prediction of natural disaster in relation to ecological infrastructure is considered helpful. Hence, Web-GIS based Ecological Infrastructure Environmental Information System (EI-EIS) has been developed. This paper aims to describe the procedure of development and future application of EI-EIS. The purpose of the EI-EIS is to evaluate functions of Eco-DRR. In order to analyse disaster data, collection of past disaster information, and disaster-prone area is effective. First, a number of digital maps and analogue maps in Japan and Europe were collected. In total, 18,572 maps over 100 years were collected. The Japanese data includes Future-Pop Data Series (1,736 maps), JMC dataset 50m grid (elevation) (13,071 maps), Old Edition Maps: Topographic Map (325 maps), Digital Base Map at a scale of 2500 for reconstruction planning (808 maps), Detailed Digital Land Use Information for Metropolitan Area (10 m land use) (2,436 maps), and Digital Information by GSI (national large scale map) (71 maps). Old Edition Maps: Topographic Map were analogue maps, and were scanned and georeferenced. These geographical area covered 1) Tohoku area, 2) Five Lakes of Mikata area (Fukui), 3) Ooshima Island (Tokyo), 4) Hiroshima area (Hiroshima), 5) Okushiri Island (Hokkaido), and 6) Toyooka City area (Hyogo). The European data includes topographic map in Germany (8 maps), old topographic map in Germany (31 maps), ancient map in Germany (23 maps), topographic map in Austria (9 maps), old topographic map in Austria (17 maps), and ancient map in Austria (37 maps). Second, focusing on Five Lakes of Mikata area as an example, these maps were integrated into the ArcGIS Online®(ESRI). These data can be overlaid, and time-series data can be visualized by a time slider function of ArcGIS Online. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Eco-drr; Ecological Disaster Reduction; Ecological Infrastructure; Environmental Information System; Web-gis; Data Reduction; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Function Evaluation; Geographic Information Systems; Information Systems; Lakes; Land Use; Landforms; Maps; Remote Sensing; Restoration; Disaster Reduction; Eco-drr; Ecological Infrastructure; Environmental Information Systems; Web-gis; Disasters","Data reduction; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Function evaluation; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Lakes; Land use; Landforms; Maps; Remote sensing; Restoration; Disaster reduction; Eco-DRR; Ecological Infrastructure; Environmental information systems; Web-GIS; Disasters","","","","Historische Karten from, (2016); Osterreichische Karte 1 50 000 Utm from, (2016); Old Edition Map Topographic Map Japan, (2016); Ecosystem Approach to Disaster Risk Reduction, (2012); Historische Topographische Karten from, (2016); Topographic Map Germany Topographische Karten Zeigen Die Formen Der Erdoberflache, (2016); Detailed Digital Land Use Information for Metropolitan Area 10 M Land Use Japan, (2016); Digital Base Map at A Scale of 2500 for Reconstruction Planning Japan, (2016); Digital Information by Gsi National Large Scale Map Japan, (2016); Jmc Dataset 50m Grid Elevation, (2016)","Zdimal, V.; Ramasamy, S.M.; Skidmore, A.; Altan, O.; Comiso, J.; Thenkabail, P.S.; Halounova, L.; Safar, V.; Planka, L.; Raju, P.L.N.; Srinivasa Kumar, T.; Lavender, S.; (Yousif) Hussin, Y.A.; Kerr, Y.; Yue, P.; Patias, P.; Faruque, F.S.; Weng, Q.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","23rd International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences Congress, ISPRS 2016","","Prague","122461","16821750","9781629935126; 9781629934297; 9781629935201","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979508793"

Rainfall erosivity is crucial to be considered at a monthly resolution, for the optimization of land management (seasonal variation of vegetation cover and agricultural support practices) as well as natural hazard protection (landslides and flood prediction). We expanded REDES by 140 rainfall stations, thus covering areas where monthly R-factor values were missing (Slovakia, Poland) or former data density was not satisfactory (Austria, France, and Spain). The different time resolutions (from 5 to 60 min) of high temporal data require a conversion of monthly R-factor based on a pool of stations with available data at all time resolutions. Because the conversion factors show smaller monthly variability in winter (January: 1.54) than in summer (August: 2.13), applying conversion factors on a monthly basis is suggested. The estimated monthly conversion factors allow transferring the R-factor to the desired time resolution at a European scale. The June to September period contributes to 53% of the annual rainfall erosivity in Europe, with different spatial and temporal patterns depending on the region. The study also investigated the heterogeneous seasonal patterns in different regions of Europe: on average, the Northern and Central European countries exhibit the largest R-factor values in summer, while the Southern European countries do so from October to January. In almost all countries (excluding Ireland, United Kingdom and North France), the seasonal variability of rainfall erosivity is high. Very few areas (mainly located in Spain and France) show the largest from February to April. The average monthly erosivity density is very large in August (1.67) and July (1.63), while very small in January and February (0.37). This study addresses the need to develop monthly calibration factors for seasonal estimation of rainfall erosivity and presents the spatial patterns of monthly rainfall erosivity in European Union and Switzerland. Moreover, the study presents the regions and seasons under threat of rainfall erosivity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Modeling; Monthly Erosion Rate; R-factor; Redes; Seasonal Rainfall Intensity; Soil Erosion; Data Handling; Erosion; Models; Erosion Rates; R Factor; Redes; Seasonal Rainfall; Soil Erosion; Rain; Assessment Method; Erosivity; European Union; Land Management; Natural Hazard; Optimization; Rainfall; Seasonal Variation; Soil Erosion; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Europe","Data handling; Erosion; Models; Erosion rates; R factor; REDES; Seasonal rainfall; Soil erosion; Rain; assessment method; erosivity; European Union; land management; natural hazard; optimization; rainfall; seasonal variation; soil erosion; spatiotemporal analysis; Europe","","","","Lal, Rattan A., Soil degradation by erosion, Land Degradation and Development, 12, 6, pp. 519-539, (2001); Panagos, Panos, Assessing soil erosion in Europe based on data collected through a European network, Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 60, 1, pp. 15-29, (2014); Wang, Guangxing, Spatial and temporal prediction and uncertainty of soil loss using the revised universal soil loss equation: A case study of the rainfall-runoff erosivity R factor, Ecological Modelling, 153, 1-2, pp. 143-155, (2002); Predicting Soil Erosion by Water A Guide to Conservation Planning with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation Rusle, (1997); Predicting Rainfall Erosion Losses A Guide to Conservation Planning, (1978); Istok, Jonathan David, EFFECT OF RAINFALL MEASUREMENT INTERVAL ON EI CALCULATION., Transactions - American Society of Agricultural Engineers: General Edition, 29, 3, pp. 730-734, (1986); Panagos, Panos, Rainfall erosivity in Europe, Science of the Total Environment, 511, pp. 801-814, (2015); Brown, Larry C., STORM EROSIVITY USING IDEALIZED INTENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS., Transactions - American Society of Agricultural Engineers: General Edition, 30, 2, pp. 379-386, (1987); Panagos, Panos, Reply to the comment on ""Rainfall erosivity in Europe"" by Auerswald et al., Science of the Total Environment, 532, pp. 853-857, (2015); Diodato, Nazzareno, Predicting RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) monthly erosivity index from readily available rainfall data in Mediterranean area, Environmentalist, 26, 1, pp. 63-70, (2006)","","MDPI AG Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","20734441","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965119219"

Rainfall over India has large spatial as well as temporal variability. To understand the variability in rainfall, spatial–temporal analyses of rainfall have been studied by using 107 (1901–2007) years of daily gridded India Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall datasets. Further, the validation of IMD precipitation data is carried out with different observational and different reanalysis datasets during the period from 1989 to 2007. The Global Precipitation Climatology Project data shows similar features as that of IMD with high degree of comparison, whereas Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation data show similar features but with large differences, especially over northwest, west coast and western Himalayas. Spatially, large deviation is observed in the interior peninsula during the monsoon season with National Aeronautics Space Administration-Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (NASA-MERRA), pre-monsoon with Japanese 25 years Re Analysis (JRA-25), and post-monsoon with climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) reanalysis datasets. Among the reanalysis datasets, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) shows good comparison followed by CFSR, NASA-MERRA, and JRA-25. Further, for the first time, with high resolution and long-term IMD data, the spatial distribution of trends is estimated using robust regression analysis technique on the annual and seasonal rainfall data with respect to different regions of India. Significant positive and negative trends are noticed in the whole time series of data during the monsoon season.

In Italy, agritourism is considered an agricultural activity and can only be performed by a farmer. Moreover, Italian national legislation forces the farmer to dedicate himself mainly to traditional farming, rather than to tourism activities. For this reason, environmental performances have been highlighted by analyzing only features and production systems of the farms. By utilizing the most frequent indicators used in studies regarding sustainability, the authors show how Italian agritourisms tend to develop more environmentally friendly agricultural methods, which have a positive impact on biodiversity, landscape and natural resources. The empirical analysis is based on the Italian FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) dataset. The European FADN was created to represent farms’ technical and economic operation in the European Union and on which it drafts the agricultural and rural policies.

The World Wide Web Consortium framed the further specification of the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), which is a formal language designed for standardized representation of structured vocabularies, as well as the Linked Data methodology of publishing structured data in a machine-readable and interlinked way, that they become more useful. Applying the Linked Data approach, the European Commission recently established e-Government Core Vocabularies. This paper describes the development of a Knowledge Organization System (KOS) in terms of a thesaurus for the domain of cadastre and land administration. The main purpose is to contribute towards the development of 'Linked Land Administration' that adopts Linked Data technologies for semantic management of datasets kept in public registries, and scholarly and legislative resources kept in libraries. The proposed controlled vocabulary in SKOS format may be used for specifying metadata records of scholarly and legislative resources, as well as enrichment of these resources through semantic annotations. It also provides a base for further ontology development initiatives. The thesaurus is mainly derived from terms of the standard ISO 19152:2012 Land Administration Domain Model, which represents the static aspect of the domain. Reports of the project Property Formation in the Nordic countries (Kort og Matrikelstyrelsen, 2006) provide the basis for the temporal or activity aspect of the domain, while the ANSI/NISO, 2005 Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies provided methodological advice. The thesaurus consists of 143 terms, the relations of which are recorded according to the mentioned SKOS standard. About one fourth of the terms are adopted from existing thesauri, including the AGROVOC multilingual agricultural vocabulary, the GEMET Thesaurus with INSPIRE Spatial Data Themes, and the STW Thesaurus for Economics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cadastre; Cadastre And Land Administration Thesaurus; Land Administration; Linked Data; Linked Land Administration; Simple Knowledge Organization System; Cadastre; Database; European Commission; Land Management; Language; Spatial Data; Terminology","cadastre; database; European Commission; land management; language; spatial data; terminology","","","","Guidelines for the Construction Format and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies, (2005); Groups Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology, (2007); Linked Data Design Issues, (2006); Bizer, Christian, Linked data - The story so far, International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems, 5, 3, pp. 1-22, (2009); Semantic Web Concepts Technologies and Applications, (2007); Metalex Open Xml Interchange Format for Legal and Legislative Resources Cen Workshop Agreement Cwa 15710, (2010); Çağdaş, Volkan, Core immovable property vocabulary for european linked land administration, Survey Review, 47, 340, pp. 49-60, (2015); Bibliographic Ontology Specification, (2009); Legal Dictionary of Property in Canada Dictionnaire Juridique De La Propriete Au Canada, (2009); Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Version 1 1 Date Issued 2012 06 14, (2012)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","02648377","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84948985186"

The European Commission's Soil Thematic Strategy has identified soil erosion as a relevant issue for the European Union, and has proposed an approach to monitor soil erosion. This paper presents the application of a modified version of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model (RUSLE2015) to estimate soil loss in Europe for the reference year 2010, within which the input factors (Rainfall erosivity, Soil erodibility, Cover-Management, Topography, Support practices) are modelled with the most recently available pan-European datasets. While RUSLE has been used before in Europe, RUSLE2015 improves the quality of estimation by introducing updated (2010), high-resolution (100m), peer-reviewed input layers. The mean soil loss rate in the European Union's erosion-prone lands (agricultural, forests and semi-natural areas) was found to be 2.46 t ha-1 yr-1, resulting in a total soil loss of 970 Mt annually. A major benefit of RUSLE2015 is that it can incorporate the effects of policy scenarios based on land-use changes and support practices. The impact of the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) requirements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the EU's guidelines for soil protection can be grouped under land management (reduced/no till, plant residues, cover crops) and support practices (contour farming, maintenance of stone walls and grass margins). The policy interventions (GAEC, Soil Thematic Strategy) over the past decade have reduced the soil loss rate by 9.5% on average in Europe, and by 20% for arable lands. Special attention is given to the 4 million ha of croplands which currently have unsustainable soil loss rates of more than 5 t ha-1 yr-1, and to which policy measures should be targeted. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Sustainability; Management Practices; Policy Scenarios; Rain Erosivity; Rusle; Soil Erodibility; Water; Water; Agricultural Land; Article; Environmental Management; Europe; Land Use; Priority Journal; Soil Analysis; Soil Erosion; Soil Water Content","water; agricultural land; Article; environmental management; Europe; land use; priority journal; soil analysis; soil erosion; soil water content","","water, 7732-18-5","","Alewell, C., An attempt to estimate tolerable soil erosion rates by matching soil formation with denudation in Alpine grasslands, Journal of Soils and Sediments, 15, 6, pp. 1383-1399, (2015); Angileri, Vincenzo, GAEC implementation in the European union: Situation and perspectives, Italian Journal of Agronomy, 6, SUPL.1, pp. 6-9, (2011); Boardman, John, Soil Erosion in Europe, pp. 1-855, (2006); Bosco, Claudio, Modelling soil erosion at European scale: Towards harmonization and reproducibility, Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, 15, 2, pp. 225-245, (2015); Cerdan, O., Rates and spatial variations of soil erosion in Europe: A study based on erosion plot data, Geomorphology, 122, 1-2, pp. 167-177, (2010); Corine Land Cover Dataset for 1990 2000 2006 and Documentation, (2014); Desmet, Philippe J.J., A GIS procedure for automatically calculating the USLE LS factor on topographically complex landscape units, Journal of Soil and Water Conservation, 51, 5, pp. 427-433, (1996); Biogeographical Regions Dataset of European Environment Agency, (2011); Elser, James J., Phosphorus cycle: A broken biogeochemical cycle, Nature, 478, 7367, pp. 29-31, (2011); Frondel, Manuel, Biodiesel: A new Oildorado?, Energy Policy, 35, 3, pp. 1675-1684, (2007)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18736416; 14629011","","ESCPF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939814271"

Moreover, it is estimated that 50% of all plant and animal species (including some of that are listed in the EU Habitat Directive) depend on agricultural practices. The continuation of appropriate agricultural land management is essential to ensure these primary functions. Avoidance of farmland abandonment is therefore an important rationale for the EU's Common Agricultural Policy which requires improved knowledge of this phenomenon at the European level. This study assesses the risk of farmland abandonment in the 27 EU Member States. It summarizes the work performed by an expert panel of European scientists and national representatives which aimed to identify the main drivers of farmland abandonment in Europe, to define indicators for assessing its risk of occurrence and to test the value of European-wide data sources to achieve these aims. Drivers were identified under two rationales: low farm stability and viability, and negative regional context. Indicators were defined using recent socio-economic farm data and geospatial datasets. Some indicators were then combined to make a composite risk indicator. Regions with higher risk of farmland abandonment are located in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Ireland. This paper demonstrates the challenges of performing a European-wide assessment of a phenomenon influenced by drivers whose effects vary at local levels. Other problems encountered are data heterogeneity in terms of spatial resolution and quality, as well as access to micro-data (local level data). High spatial resolution European datasets measuring farmland abandonment are needed to validate the defined indicators as well as to benchmark the methodology. Furthermore, such data could be used to establish a weighting system for the drivers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Common Agricultural Policy; Composite Indicator; Europe; Farmland Abandonment; Land Management; Abandoned Land; Agricultural Land; Common Agricultural Policy; Identification Method; Land Management; Land Use Planning; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Indicator; Spatial Resolution; Estonia; Finland; Greece; Ireland; Italy; Latvia; Portugal; Spain; Sweden; Animalia","abandoned land; agricultural land; Common Agricultural Policy; identification method; land management; land use planning; risk assessment; socioeconomic indicator; spatial resolution; Estonia; Finland; Greece; Ireland; Italy; Latvia; Portugal; Spain; Sweden; Animalia","","","","Farming at the Margins Abandonment or Redeployment of Agricultural Land in Europe, (1996); Options Mediterraneennes, (1991); Rey-Benayas, José María, Abandonment of agricultural land: An overview of drivers and consequences, CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources, 2, (2007); Ministry of Housing Spatial Planning and the Environment National Spatial Planning Agency, (1995); Bojnec, Štefan, Farm size, agricultural subsidies and farm performance in Slovenia, Land Use Policy, 32, pp. 207-217, (2013); Livestock Systems in European Rural Development, (1997); Ciaian, Pavel, Credit market imperfections and the distribution of policy rents, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 91, 4, pp. 1124-1139, (2009); Cocca, Giampaolo, Is the abandonment of traditional livestock farming systems the main driver of mountain landscape change in Alpine areas?, Land Use Policy, 29, 4, pp. 878-886, (2012); Working Paper Presented at the Avec Workshop on Effects of Land Abandonment and Global Change on Plant and Animal Communities, (2004); Corbelle-Rico, Eduardo, Evaluating IRENA indicator ""Risk of Farmland Abandonment"" on a low spatial scale level: The case of Galicia (Spain), Land Use Policy, 38, pp. 9-15, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","02648377","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937913300"

Among the different soil erosion risk factors, the cover-management factor (C-factor) is the one that policy makers and farmers can most readily influence in order to help reduce soil loss rates. The present study proposes a methodology for estimating the C-factor in the European Union (EU), using pan-European datasets (such as CORINE Land Cover), biophysical attributes derived from remote sensing, and statistical data on agricultural crops and practices. In arable lands, the C-factor was estimated using crop statistics (% of land per crop) and data on management practices such as conservation tillage, plant residues and winter crop cover. The C-factor in non-arable lands was estimated by weighting the range of literature values found according to fractional vegetation cover, which was estimated based on the remote sensing dataset F<inf>cover</inf>. The mean C-factor in the EU is estimated to be 0.1043, with an extremely high variability; forests have the lowest mean C-factor (0.00116), and arable lands and sparsely vegetated areas the highest (0.233 and 0.2651, respectively). Conservation management practices (reduced/no tillage, use of cover crops and plant residues) reduce the C-factor by on average 19.1% in arable lands.The methodology is designed to be a tool for policy makers to assess the effect of future land use and crop rotation scenarios on soil erosion by water.

This paper reviews the history of land conversion in the Cerrado and the development of soil properties and water resources under past and ongoing land use. We compared soil and water quality parameters from different land uses considering 80 soil and 18 water studies conducted in different regions across the Cerrado to provide quantitative evidence of soil and water alterations from land use change. Following the conversion of native Cerrado, significant effects on soil pH, bulk density and available P and K for croplands and less-pronounced effects on pastures were evident. Soil total N did not differ between land uses because most of the sites classified as croplands were nitrogen-fixing soybeans, which are not artificially fertilized with N. In contrast, water quality studies showed nitrogen enrichment in agricultural catchments, indicating fertilizer impacts and potential susceptibility to eutrophication. Regardless of the land use, P is widely absent because of the high-fixing capacities of deeply weathered soils and the filtering capacity of riparian vegetation. Pesticides, however, were consistently detected throughout the entire aquatic system. In several case studies, extremely high-peak concentrations exceeded Brazilian and European Union (EU) water quality limits, which were potentially accompanied by serious health implications. Land use intensification is likely to continue, particularly in regions where less annual rainfall and severe droughts are projected in the northeastern and western Cerrado. Thus, the leaching risk and displacement of agrochemicals are expected to increase, particularly because the current legislation has caused a reduction in riparian vegetation. We conclude that land use intensification is likely to seriously limit the Cerrado's future regarding both agricultural productivity and ecosystem stability. Because only limited data are available, we recommend further field studies to understand the interaction between terrestrial and aquatic systems. This study may serve as a valuable database for integrated modelling to investigate the impact of land use and climate change on soil and water resources and to test and develop mitigation measures for the Cerrado.

Statistical methods were applied on a three-month hourly data set (9th January to 24th March 2014) to study the influence of north-easterly winds on the patterns of particle mass and PNC size distributions. The 24-h concentrations of particle mass obtained in this study were below the standard values detailed by the Recommended Malaysian Air Quality Guideline (RMAQG), United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and European Union (EU) except for PM<inf>2.5</inf>, which recorded a 24-h average of 30 ± 18 μg m-3 and exceeded the World Health Organisation (WHO) threshold value (25 μg m-3). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that PNC with smaller diameter sizes (0.27-4.50 μm) showed a stronger influence, accounting for 57.6% of the variability in PNC data set. Concentrations of both particle mass and PNC increased steadily in the morning with a distinct peak observed at around 8.00 h, related to a combination of dispersion of accumulated particles overnight and local traffic. In addition to local anthropogenic, agricultural burning and forest fire activities, long-range transport also affects the study area. Hotspot and backward wind trajectory observations illustrated that the biomass burning episode (around February-March) significantly influenced PNC. Meteorological parameters influenced smaller size particles (i.e. PM<inf>1</inf> and Dp (0.27-0.43 μm)) the most. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerosols; Biomass Episodes; Long-range Transport; Meteorology; Multivariate Analysis; Aerosols; Agricultural Robots; Air Quality; Atmospheric Movements; Deforestation; Environmental Protection Agency; Meteorology; Multivariant Analysis; Agricultural Burning; Coastal Environments; Long Range Transport; Meteorological Parameters; Multi Variate Analysis; Number Concentration; Particle Number Concentration; United States Environmental Protection Agencies; Particle Size Analysis; Air Quality; Anthropogenic Effect; Coastal Zone; Concentration (composition); Dispersion; Marine Environment; Particle Size; Principal Component Analysis; Tropical Environment; Ambient Air; Article; Atmospheric Pressure; Biomass; Circadian Rhythm; Coastal Waters; European Union; Government; Humidity; Meteorological Phenomena; Meteorology; Particulate Matter; Priority Journal; Sea; Southeast Asia; Varimax Rotation; Weather; Wind; Winter; World Health Organization; Biomass; Epa; Forest Fires; Transport; Malaysia","Aerosols; Agricultural robots; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Deforestation; Environmental Protection Agency; Meteorology; Multivariant analysis; Agricultural burning; Coastal environments; Long range transport; Meteorological parameters; Multi variate analysis; Number concentration; Particle number concentration; United states environmental protection agencies; Particle size analysis; air quality; anthropogenic effect; coastal zone; concentration (composition); dispersion; marine environment; particle size; principal component analysis; tropical environment; ambient air; Article; atmospheric pressure; biomass; circadian rhythm; coastal waters; European Union; government; humidity; meteorological phenomena; meteorology; particulate matter; priority journal; sea; Southeast Asia; varimax rotation; weather; wind; winter; world health organization; Biomass; EPA; Forest Fires; Transport; Malaysia","","","The authors would like to thank Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia for the Research University Grants ( ICONIC-2013-004 and DIP-2014-005 ), and the Ministry of Education for the Fundamental Research Grant ( FRGS/1/2013/STWN01/UKM/02/2 ).

Arundo donax L.) represents a promising opportunity to reduce the fossil fuel dependency of Mediterranean countries. Nevertheless, the response of this crop to future climate projections is an open issue despite the crucial implications for mid-term planning policies. In this study, we present an exploratory analysis of the climate change impact on giant reed productivity in the Lombardy plain (northern Italy), an area that is currently characterized by intensive fodder corn-based cropping systems, but where corn is expected to be negatively affected by projected changes in thermal and pluviometric regimes. A dedicated simulation environment was developed, by coupling Arungro, a process-based model specific to giant reed, to a database including information on the presence of biogas plants, land use, crop management and distribution, in addition to weather scenarios for current climate and future projections. The baseline climate (1975-1994) was obtained from the European Commission MARS database; the Hadley3 and NCAR realizations of the IPCC AR4 emission scenarios A1B and B1 were used to generate 20-year climate projections centred on 2020 and 2050. Spatially distributed simulations were run at a sub-regional scale in areas selected according to their attractiveness for investments and low risk of competition between feed and no-feed crop destinations. The results indicate that an increased local suitability of giant reed in future climate projections is expected in terms of biomass production (+20% in 2020 for all scenarios and +30% in 2050 for Hadley-A1B) and the economic and environmental sustainability of related cropping systems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arundo Donax L.; Arungro; Biogas Plant; Crop Model; Renewable Energy; Zea Mais L; Agriculture; Biogas; Climate Models; Crops; Economics; Investments; Land Use; Plants (botany); Sustainable Development; Arundo Donax L; Arungro; Biogas Plants; Crop Model; Renewable Energies; Zea Mais L; Climate Change; Agricultural Modeling; Climate Change; Cropping Practice; Ecological Modeling; Economic Analysis; Energy Crop; European Commission; Fodder; Intensive Agriculture; Maize; Policy Making; Reedbed; Renewable Resource; Sustainability; Italy; Lombardy Basin; Mediterranean Region; Arundo Donax; Zea Mays","Agriculture; Biogas; Climate models; Crops; Economics; Investments; Land use; Plants (botany); Sustainable development; Arundo donax L; Arungro; Biogas plants; Crop model; Renewable energies; Zea mais L; Climate change; agricultural modeling; climate change; cropping practice; ecological modeling; economic analysis; energy crop; European Commission; fodder; intensive agriculture; maize; policy making; reedbed; renewable resource; sustainability; Italy; Lombardy Basin; Mediterranean Region; Arundo donax; Zea mays","","","This study received financial support from (i) the EC Seven Framework Programme (KBBE.2013.1.4-09) under Grant Agreement No. 613817 2013\u20132016 (MODEXTREME), (ii) ERSAF\u2013Regione Lombardia , under Grant Agreement No. 001T0022013 , and (iii) the University of Milan Development Plan (line B).","Porter, John R., Crop responses to climatic variation, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 360, 1463, pp. 2021-2035, (2005); Kang, Yinhong, Climate change impacts on crop yield, crop water productivity and food security - A review, Progress in Natural Science: Materials International, 19, 12, pp. 1665-1674, (2009); Lobell, David B., Global scale climate-crop yield relationships and the impacts of recent warming, Environmental Research Letters, 2, 1, (2007); Masutomi, Yuji, Impact assessment of climate change on rice production in Asia in comprehensive consideration of process/parameter uncertainty in general circulation models, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 131, 3-4, pp. 281-291, (2009); Jones, Peter G., The potential impacts of climate change on maize production in Africa and Latin America in 2055, Global Environmental Change, 13, 1, pp. 51-59, (2003); Climate Change and Agriculture in Latin America 2020 2050 Projected Impacts and Response to Adaptation Strategies, (2012); Supit, Iwan, Assessing climate change effects on European crop yields using the Crop Growth Monitoring System and a weather generator, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 164, pp. 96-111, (2012); Physical Science Basis Contribution of Working Group 1 to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2007); Lombardy Agriculture in Figure, (2013); Confalonieri, Roberto, Evaluation of CropSyst for simulating the yield of flooded rice in northern Italy, European Journal of Agronomy, 23, 4, pp. 315-326, (2005)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","18732909; 09619534","","BMSBE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929397208"

This paper illustrates how species distribution modelling integrated with host tree species distribution data can be used to assess forest vulnerability to this threat. Two case studies are used: large pine weevil (Hylobius abietis L) and horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimič) both at pan-European level. The proposed approach integrates information from different sources. Occurrence data of insect pests were collected from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), climatic variables for present climate and future scenarios were sourced, respectively, from WorldClim and from the Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), and distributional data of host tree species were obtained from the European Forest Data Centre (EFDAC), within the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). The potential habitat of the target pests was calculated using the machine learning algorithm of Maxent model. On the one hand, the results highlight the potential of species distribution modelling as a valuable tool for decision makers.

Many species and ecosystems of conservation concern in Europe depend on agricultural management and are showing ongoing declines. Agri-environment schemes (AES) are designed partly to address this. They are a major source of nature conservation funding within the European Union (EU) and the highest conservation expenditure in Europe. We reviewed the structure of current AES across Europe. Since a 2003 review questioned the overall effectiveness of AES for biodiversity, there has been a plethora of case studies and meta-analyses examining their effectiveness. Most syntheses demonstrate general increases in farmland biodiversity in response to AES, with the size of the effect depending on the structure and management of the surrounding landscape. This is important in the light of successive EU enlargement and ongoing reforms of AES. We examined the change in effect size over time by merging the data sets of 3 recent meta-analyses and found that schemes implemented after revision of the EU's agri-environmental programs in 2007 were not more effective than schemes implemented before revision. Furthermore, schemes aimed at areas out of production (such as field margins and hedgerows) are more effective at enhancing species richness than those aimed at productive areas (such as arable crops or grasslands). Outstanding research questions include whether AES enhance ecosystem services, whether they are more effective in agriculturally marginal areas than in intensively farmed areas, whether they are more or less cost-effective for farmland biodiversity than protected areas, and how much their effectiveness is influenced by farmer training and advice? The general lesson from the European experience is that AES can be effective for conserving wildlife on farmland, but they are expensive and need to be carefully designed and targeted. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Intensification; Common Agricultural Policy; Europe; European Union; Farmland; Field Margin; Grassland; Organic Management; Agri-environmental Policy; Agricultural Intensification; Agricultural Land; Environmental Management; Field Margin; Grassland; Meta-analysis; Nature Conservation; Organic Farming; Species Richness; Europe; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Cost Benefit Analysis; Economics; Ecosystem; Environmental Policy; Environmental Protection; History; Legislation And Jurisprudence; Meta Analysis; Procedures; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Cost-benefit Analysis; Ecosystem; Environmental Policy; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century","agri-environmental policy; agricultural intensification; agricultural land; environmental management; field margin; grassland; meta-analysis; nature conservation; organic farming; species richness; Europe; agriculture; biodiversity; cost benefit analysis; economics; ecosystem; environmental policy; environmental protection; history; legislation and jurisprudence; meta analysis; procedures; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Ecosystem; Environmental Policy; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century","","","","Armsworth, Paul R., The cost of policy simplification in conservation incentive programs, Ecology Letters, 15, 5, pp. 406-414, (2012); Attwood, Simon J., Declining birds in Australian agricultural landscapes may benefit from aspects of the European agri-environment model, Biological Conservation, 142, 10, pp. 1981-1991, (2009); Báldi, András, The past and future of farmland birds in Hungary, Bird Study, 58, 3, pp. 365-377, (2011); Batáry, Péter, Landscape-moderated biodiversity effects of agri-environmental management: A meta-analysis, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 278, 1713, pp. 1894-1902, (2011); Boitani, Luigi, Introduction, Conservation Biology, 29, 4, pp. 975-977, (2015); Burton, Rob J.F., Result-oriented agri-environmental schemes in Europe and their potential for promoting behavioural change, Land Use Policy, 30, 1, pp. 628-641, (2013); Carvalheiro, Luísa Gigante Gigante, Species richness declines and biotic homogenisation have slowed down for NW-European pollinators and plants, Ecology Letters, 16, 7, pp. 870-878, (2013); Debussche, Max, Mediterranean landscape changes: Evidence from old postcards, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 8, 1, pp. 3-15, (1999); Defrancesco, E., Factors affecting farmers'participation in agri-environmental measures: A northern Italian perspective, Journal of Agricultural Economics, 59, 1, pp. 114-131, (2008); De Snoo, Geert G.

To reduce farming-related GHG emissions, appropriate policy measures and supporting tools for promoting low-C farming practices may be efficacious. This article presents the methodology and testing results of a new EU-wide, farm-level C footprint calculator. The Carbon Calculator quantifies GHG emissions based on international standards and technical specifications on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and C footprinting. The tool delivers its results both at the farm level and as allocated to up to 5 main products of the farm. In addition to the quantification of GHG emissions, the calculator proposes mitigation options and sequestration actions that may be suitable for individual farms. The results obtained during a survey made on 54 farms from 8 EU Member States are presented. These farms were selected in view of representing the diversity of farm types across different environmental zones in the EU. The results of the C footprint of products in the data set show wide range of variation between minimum and maximum values. The results of the mitigation actions showed that the tool can help identify practices that can lead to substantial emission reductions. To avoid burden-shifting from climate change to other environmental issues, the future improvements of the tool should include incorporation of other environmental impact categories in place of solely focusing on GHG emissions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; C Footprint; Farming Practices; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Life Cycle Assessment; Carbon; Carbon; Carbon; Agriculture; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; European Union; Procedures; Statistics And Numerical Data; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring","carbon; agriculture; carbon footprint; climate change; environmental monitoring; European Union; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon","","","","Wiley-Blackwell","","","","","","15513793; 15513777","","","25655187","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84973908827"

The ethnoveterinary pharmacopoeia is often composed of ingredients available in the local environment, and may include plants, animals and minerals, or combinations thereof, for use in treating various ailments in reared animals. The aim of this study was to survey the current day ethnoveterinary practices of ethnic Hungarian (Székely) settlements situated in the Erdővidék commune (Covasna County, Transylvania, Romania) and to compare them with earlier works on this topic in Romania and other European countries. Methods: Data concerning ethnoveterinary practices were collected through semi-structured interviews and direct observation in 12 villages from 2010 to 2014. The cited plant species were collected, identified, dried and deposited in a herbarium. The use of other materials (e.g. animals, minerals and other substances) were also documented. Data were compared to earlier reports of ethnoveterinary knowledge in Transylvania and other European countries using various databases. Results: In total, 26 wild and cultivated plants, 2 animals, and 17 other substances were documented to treat 11 ailments of cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep. The majority of applications were for the treatment of mastitis and skin ailments, while only a few data were reported for the treatment of cataracts, post-partum ailments and parasites. The traditional uses of Armoracia rusticana, Rumex spp., powdered sugar and glass were reported in each village. The use of some plant taxa, such as Allium sativum, Aristolochia clematitis, and Euphorbia amygdaloides was similar to earlier reports from other Transylvanian regions. Conclusions: Although permanent veterinary and medical services are available in some of the villages, elderly people preferred the use of wild and cultivated plants, animals and other materials in ethnoveterinary medicine. Some traditional ethnoveterinary practices are no longer in use, but rather persist only in the memories of the eldest subset of the population. A decline in the vertical transmission of ethnoveterinary knowledge was evident and loss of practice is likely compounded by market availability of ready-made pharmaceuticals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covasna; Livestock; Székelys; Traditional Knowledge; Veterinary Medicine; Animalia; Adult; Aged; Animal; Bovine; Ethnology; Female; Horse; Human; Hungary; Interview; Male; Medicinal Plant; Middle Aged; Pig; Procedures; Romania; Sheep; Traditional Medicine; Very Elderly; Veterinary Medicine; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 And Over; Animals; Cattle; Female; Horses; Humans; Interviews As Topic; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Plants, Medicinal; Sheep; Swine; Veterinary Medicine","Animalia; adult; aged; animal; bovine; ethnology; female; horse; human; Hungary; interview; male; medicinal plant; middle aged; pig; procedures; Romania; sheep; traditional medicine; very elderly; veterinary medicine; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Cattle; Female; Horses; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Plants, Medicinal; Sheep; Swine; Veterinary Medicine","","","We are grateful for the help and contributions of the study participants.

From a meteorological point of view, drought can be induced and/or reinforced by lack of precipitation, hot temperatures and enhanced evapotranspiration. Starting from a multi-indicator approach, we present European-wide meteorological drought climatologies and trends for the period 1950-2012. As input data, we used precipitation and temperature data from the E-OBS (spatial resolution: 0.25°. ×. 0.25°) gridded dataset of the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D). Precipitation, temperature, and the derived potential evapotranspiration (PET) have been used to compute three drought indicators: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI). SPI, SPEI, and RDI, calculated for 12-month accumulation period, have been rationally merged into a combined indicator and this quantity has been used to obtain drought frequency, duration, and severity for the entire Europe. We identified the following drought hotspots: Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and Russia in 1951-1970, no particular hotspot in 1971-1990, the Mediterranean region and the Baltic Republics in 1991-2010. A linear trend analysis shows that drought variables increased in the period 1950-2012 in South-Western Europe, in particular in the Mediterranean and Carpathian regions, with precipitation decrease and PET increase as drivers. Drought variables show a decrease in Scandinavia, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia: precipitation increase is the main driver. In Central Europe and the Balkans, drought variables show a moderate increase, for the significant PET increase outbalances a not significant precipitation increase. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drought; Europe; Pet; Precipitation; Rdi; Spei; Spi; Climatology; Evapotranspiration; Polyethylene Terephthalates; Precipitation (chemical); Europe; Meteorological Drought; Potential Evapotranspiration; Rdi; Reconnaissance Drought Indices; Spei; Spi; Standardized Precipitation Index; Drought; Agricultural Practice; Climatology; Data Set; Drought Stress; Economic Analysis; Evapotranspiration; Precipitation (climatology); Temperature Effect; Carpathian Basin; Mediterranean Region","Climatology; Evapotranspiration; Polyethylene terephthalates; Precipitation (chemical); Europe; Meteorological drought; Potential evapotranspiration; RDI; Reconnaissance drought indices; SPEI; SPI; Standardized precipitation index; Drought; agricultural practice; climatology; data set; drought stress; economic analysis; evapotranspiration; precipitation (climatology); temperature effect; Carpathian Basin; Mediterranean Region","","","","FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper, (1998); Beguería, Santiago, Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) revisited: Parameter fitting, evapotranspiration models, tools, datasets and drought monitoring, International Journal of Climatology, 34, 10, pp. 3001-3023, (2014); Technical Report 009 2007, (2007); 10th EMS Annual Meeting 10th European Conference on Applications of Meteorology Ecam Abstracts EMS 2010 370, (2010); Briffa, Keith K., Wet and dry summers in europe since 1750: Evidence of increasing drought, International Journal of Climatology, 29, 13, pp. 1894-1905, (2009); Brutsaert, Wilfried H., Hydrologic cycle explains the evaporation paradox [8], Nature, 396, 6706, (1998); Dai, Aiguo, Characteristics and trends in various forms of the Palmer Drought Severity Index during 1900-2008, Journal of Geophysical Research, 116, 12, (2011); Dai, Aiguo, Drought under global warming: A review, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, 2, 1, pp. 45-65, (2011); Dai, Aiguo, Increasing drought under global warming in observations and models, Nature Climate Change, 3, 1, pp. 52-58, (2013); Dai, Aiguo, A global dataset of Palmer Drought Severity Index for 1870-2002: Relationship with soil moisture and effects of surface warming, Journal of Hydrometeorology, 5, 6, pp. 1117-1130, (2004)","","Elsevier","","","","","","09218181","","GPCHE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940364481"

A weed traits database (WTDB) was designed, populated and analysed, initially using data for 19 common European weeds, to begin to consolidate trait data in a single repository. The initial choice of traits was driven by the requirements of empirical models of weed population dynamics to identify correlations between traits and model parameters. These relationships were used to build a generic model, operating at the level of functional traits, to simulate the impact of increasing herbicide and fertiliser use on virtual weeds along gradients of seed weight and maximum height. The model generated 'fitness contours' (defined as population growth rates) within this trait space in different scenarios, onto which two sets of weed species, defined as common or declining in the UK, were mapped. The effect of increasing inputs on the weed flora was successfully simulated; 77% of common species were predicted to have stable or increasing populations under high fertiliser and herbicide use, in contrast with only 29% of the species that have declined.

User groups with an interest in past land cover include the climate modelling community, socio-ecological historians and earth system scientists. Europe is one of the continents with the longest histories of land conversion from forest to farmland, thus understanding land cover change in this area is globally significant. This study applies the pseudobiomization method (PBM) to 982 pollen records from across Europe, taken from the European Pollen Database (EPD) to produce a first synthesis of pan-European land cover change for the period 9000 bp to present, in contiguous 200 year time intervals. The PBM transforms pollen proportions from each site to one of eight land cover classes (LCCs) that are directly comparable to the CORINE land cover classification. The proportion of LCCs represented in each time window provides a spatially aggregated record of land cover change for temperate and northern Europe, and for a series of case study regions (western France, the western Alps, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia). At the European scale, the impact of Neolithic food producing economies appear to be detectable from 6000 bp through reduction in broad-leaf forests resulting from human land use activities such as forest clearance. Total forest cover at a pan-European scale moved outside the range of previous background variability from 4000 bp onwards. From 2200 bp land cover change intensified, and the broad pattern of land cover for preindustrial Europe was established by 1000 bp. Recognizing the timing of anthropogenic land cover change in Europe will further the understanding of land cover-climate interactions, and the origins of the modern cultural landscape. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Europe; Holocene; Human Impacts; Land Cover; Pollen; Pseudobiomization; Vegetation; Agricultural Land; Anthropogenic Effect; Broad-leaved Forest; Cultural Landscape; Forest Clearance; Holocene; Land Cover; Land Use Change; Neolithic; Palynology; Alps; Czech Republic; France; Slovakia; Western Alps; Agriculture; Classification; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Forest; Pollen; Procedures; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Pollen","agricultural land; anthropogenic effect; broad-leaved forest; cultural landscape; forest clearance; Holocene; land cover; land use change; Neolithic; palynology; Alps; Czech Republic; France; Slovakia; Western Alps; agriculture; classification; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; Europe; forest; pollen; procedures; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Pollen","","","","Anthropogenic Indicators in Pollen Diagrams, (1986); Corine Land Cover Technical Guide Addendum 2000, (2000); Broström, Anna, Pollen productivity estimates of key European plant taxa for quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation: A review, Vegetation History and Archaeobotany, 17, 5, pp. 461-478, (2008); Brown, Tony Gavin, Roman vineyards in Britain: Finds from the Nene Valley and new research, Antiquity, 74, 285, pp. 491-492, (2000); Collins, Pamela M., The mid-Holocene vegetation of the Mediterranean region and southern Europe, and comparison with the present day, Journal of Biogeography, 39, 10, pp. 1848-1861, (2012); American Journal of Science, (1963); Davis, Basil A.S., The age and post-glacial development of the modern European vegetation: a plant functional approach based on pollen data, Vegetation History and Archaeobotany, 24, 2, pp. 303-317, (2015); Ellis, Erle Christopher, Used planet: A global history, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110, 20, pp. 7978-7985, (2013); Foley, Jonathan A., Feedbacks between climate and boreal forests during the Holocene epoch, Nature, 371, 6492, pp. 52-54, (1994); Foulds, Simon A., Holocene land-use change and its impact on river basin dynamics in Great Britain and Ireland, Progress in Physical Geography, 30, 5, pp. 589-604, (2006)","","","","","","","","13541013; 13652486","","","25345850","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923094993"

Until recently, the application of this model has not been very widespread. Hence, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the CROPGRO cabbage model for white cabbage (Brassica oleracea convar. capitata var. alba L.) production under temperate European climate conditions. Data sets of field experiments from southwest Germany were used for model calibration including observed data of number of leaves, leaf area index, specific leaf area, leaf and stem weight, head weight and total aboveground biomass. For model evaluation, cabbage data sets over three years from southeast and over two years from east Germany were used. The genotype files (cultivar and ecotype), which include the main parameters of crop phenology and plant growth, were adapted to the standard European cabbage cultivar 'Kalorama'. Observed dry matter cabbage head yields over different years and different locations ranged between 6574kgha-1 and 11926kgha-1; head yields over all datasets were predicted by the model with an accuracy of R2=0.98. Sensitivity analysis conducted under different nitrogen fertilizer amounts (-50% N to +50% N) and two fertilizer application strategies (basal and split) generated logical, useful results from an agronomic point of view. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the efficiency of nitrogen fertilization highly depends on the genetically determined potential yield of a specific cabbage cultivar under given environmental conditions. Overall, the CROPGRO cabbage model proved to be suitable for predicting white cabbage yields under temperate European climate conditions and under different management strategies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dssat; Modeling; Nitrogen Fertilization; Split Application; Vegetables; Agricultural Management; Agricultural Modeling; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Cultivar; Decision Support System; Fertilizer Application; Horticulture; Leafy Vegetable; Temperate Environment; Germany; Hawaii [united States]; United States; Brassica Oleracea; Brassica Oleracea Var.

Biomass products, such as food, fiber, or bioenergy, are increasingly traded globally, thereby leading to telecouplings between distant, seemingly unrelated regions. For example, restrictions for agricultural production or changes in bioenergy demand in Europe or the United States might contribute to deforestation in Latin America or Sub-Saharan Africa. One approach to analyze trade-related land-use effects of the global socioeconomic biomass metabolism is the ""embodied human appropriation of net primary production"" or eHANPP. eHANPP accounts allocate to any product the entire amount of the human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) that emerges throughout its supply chain. This allows consumption-based accounts to move beyond simple area-demand approaches by taking differences in natural productivity as well as in land-use intensity into account, both across land-use types as well as across world regions. In this article, we discuss the eHANPP related to the European Union's (EU) consumption of biomass products in the period 1986-2007, based on a consistent global trade data set derived from bilateral data. We find a considerable dependency of the EU on the appropriation of biological productivity outside its own boundaries, with increasing reliance on Latin America as a main supplier. By using the EU as an illustrative example, we demonstrate the usefulness of eHANPP for assessing land-use impacts caused by nations' socioeconomic activities and conclude that the eHANPP approach can provide useful information to better manage ecosystems globally in the face of an increasingly interconnected world. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomass; Consumption-based Accounts; Displacement Of Land Use; Human Appropriation Of Net Primary Production (hanpp); Industrial Ecology; Telecoupling; Agriculture; Commerce; Deforestation; Ecology; Economics; International Trade; Land Use; Productivity; Supply Chains; Agricultural Productions; Biological Productivity; Biomass Consumption; Consumption-based Accounts; Human Appropriation Of Net Primary Production (hanpp); Industrial Ecology; Net Primary Production; Telecoupling; Biomass; Agricultural Production; Bioenergy; Biomass; Consumption Behavior; Deforestation; Global Trade; Globalization; Industrial Ecology; Industrial Production; Land Use Change; Net Primary Production; Socioeconomic Impact; Supply Chain Management; Europe; Latin America; Sub-saharan Africa; United States","Agriculture; Commerce; Deforestation; Ecology; Economics; International trade; Land use; Productivity; Supply chains; Agricultural productions; Biological productivity; Biomass consumption; Consumption-based accounts; Human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP); Industrial ecology; Net primary production; Telecoupling; Biomass; agricultural production; bioenergy; biomass; consumption behavior; deforestation; global trade; globalization; industrial ecology; industrial production; land use change; net primary production; socioeconomic impact; supply chain management; Europe; Latin America; Sub-Saharan Africa; United States","","","","Bondeau, Alberte, Modelling the role of agriculture for the 20th century global terrestrial carbon balance, Global Change Biology, 13, 3, pp. 679-706, (2007); Bruckner, Martin, Materials embodied in international trade - Global material extraction and consumption between 1995 and 2005, Global Environmental Change, 22, 3, pp. 568-576, (2012); Davis, Steven J., Consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 107, 12, pp. 5687-5692, (2010); Erb, Karl Heinz, Actual land demand of Austria 1926-2000: A variation on Ecological Footprint assessments, Land Use Policy, 21, 3, pp. 247-259, (2004); Erb, Karl Heinz, A conceptual framework for analysing and measuring land-use intensity, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 5, 5, pp. 464-470, (2013); Erb, Karl Heinz, Embodied HANPP: Mapping the spatial disconnect between global biomass production and consumption, Ecological Economics, 69, 2, pp. 328-334, (2009); Faostat FAO Statistical Databases, (2010); Global Agro Ecological Zones, (2000); Galloway, James N., International trade in meat: The tip of the pork chop, Ambio, 36, 8, pp. 622-629, (2007); Gerbens-Leenes, P.

This article gives a summary of the work on impacts and shows detailed results of a comparison of stakeholder perception on drought impacts with data from the European Drought Impact report Inventory (EDII), the new database established within the project. The data largely confirm the perceived importance of impacts on agriculture, water supply, and energy production, with data on reported impacts suggesting a slightly higher relative importance of agriculture in the South and East, of public water supplies in the South and West; the importance of energy and industry impacts appears to be country-specific. The differences in relevance of the affected sectors and in type of impacts even within the same broader category support the need to determine impact-specific indicators for monitoring and management.

By applying a qualitative content analysis, this paper analyses how food manufacturers and retailers (referred to as gatekeepers in the food industry) explain and defend the exclusion of GM-labelled food products on the EU market. The study design places emphasis on the role of perceptions in the strategic behaviour of gatekeepers and on the role of interaction in this regard, as we assume that the way in which gatekeepers perceive the 'rules of the game' for commercialising GM crop applications on the EU food market will be influenced by their interaction with other agribusiness actors.In a first stage, the analysis determines thematic congruence in the (types of) perceptions that explain an agribusiness actor's overall interpretation of the EU business environment for GM crop applications. This perceived 'structuring arena' (SA) for GM crop applications - as conceptualised within our framework - contains areas of either internal and external tensions, that have a compelling or non-committal influence on the agribusiness actor's interpretation. In a second stage, the analysis particularly defines how gatekeepers in the food industry perceive and experience the SA for GM crop applications on the EU market, and how these perceptual tensions subsequently influence their strategic behaviour for GM-labelled products on the EU market. Finally, we highlight how these perceptions and actions (or inaction) suppress the main changes in practice that are necessary to manage this wicked problem. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crops; Food Products; Genetically Modified Plants; Business Environments; Business Strategy; Content Analysis; External Tension; Food Industries; Food Manufacturers; Genetically Modified Crops; Wicked Problems; Commerce; Article; Commercial Phenomena; Conceptual Framework; Crop Management; Food Industry; Genetically Modified Food; Human; Organic Farming; Profit; Crop; Data Base; Economics; European Union; Food; Genetics; Growth, Development And Aging; Marketing; Transgenic Plant; Crops, Agricultural; Databases As Topic; Food; Food, Genetically Modified; Marketing; Plants, Genetically Modified","Crops; Food products; Genetically modified plants; Business environments; Business strategy; Content analysis; External tension; Food industries; Food manufacturers; Genetically modified crops; Wicked problems; Commerce; Article; commercial phenomena; conceptual framework; crop management; food industry; genetically modified food; human; organic farming; profit; crop; data base; economics; European Union; food; genetics; growth, development and aging; marketing; transgenic plant; Crops, Agricultural; Databases as Topic; Food; Food, Genetically Modified; Marketing; Plants, Genetically Modified","","","The first author wished to thank the FWO (Research Foundation Flanders) for a pre-doctoral fellowship at Ghent University.
