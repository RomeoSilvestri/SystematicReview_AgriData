The source of data has decided to take into account Sentinel-2 L2A and Sentinel-1 VH (Vertical-transmit and Horizontal-receive) datasets for testing image fusion classifiers used in the experiments. Different kinds of classifiers were used in this research. Among them, MDC stands for Minimum Distance Classifier, and Maximum Likelihood Classifier represents MLC. Lastly, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used during the fusion of the images to classify Land Use and determine the validity of these algorithms. A summary of the outputs will give an upper hand to the classifiers based on Support Vector Machines, with the accuracy reaching 95.67% and a kappa of 0.9191. The SVM classification algorithm during the study showed the dense vegetation, deciduous vegetation, water, and urban zones with shallow errors. MDC performed the task well in detecting the land use category with an accuracy of 91.70% and kappa of 0.8469. The opposite of the MDC classifier was that the accuracy was not the top level, as, in some ways, some water bodies were wrongly assigned as urban regions. MLC has the least promising result among other approaches and is in the last place in terms of accuracy, with 89.52% and a kappa value of 0.8281.","","979-8-3503-8749-0","10.1109/ICTACS62700.2024.10840995","European Space Agency's Copernicus; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10840995","Classification;Fusion Techniques;Sentinel-2;Microwave Data;Optical Data;Remote Sensing;Land Classification;Sentinel-1;Satellite Data","Support vector machines;Accuracy;Land surface;Vegetation mapping;Sentinel-1;Optical imaging;Classification algorithms;Optical sensors;Image fusion;Microwave imaging","","4","","19","IEEE","21 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In regions where TCA is deemed unreliable, we use correlation significance levels ( $p$ -values) as indicator for retrieval quality to decide whether to use active data only, passive data only, or an unweighted average. We apply the proposed merging scheme to active retrievals from advanced scatterometer and passive retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer—Earth Observing System using Global Land Data Assimilation System-Noah to complement the triplet required for TCA. The merged time series is evaluated against soil moisture estimates from ERA-Interim/Land and in situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network using the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) current Climate Change Initiative—Soil Moisture (ESA CCI SM) product version v02.3 as benchmark merging scheme. Results show that the  $p$ -value classification provides a robust basis for decisions regarding using either active or passive data alone, or an unweighted average in cases where relative weights cannot be estimated reliably, and that the weights estimated from TCA in almost all cases outperform the ternary decision upon which the ESA CCI SM v02.3 is based.

Since the deployment and maintenance of physical sensors in the fields potentially involves significant costs and human effort, open-access data sources may be an effective complement to environmental data from deployed sensors, but the question remains whether open-access data sources are comparable to locally deployed sensors in terms of accuracy. This paper analyzes the correlation between open environmental data sources provided by the Copernicus ERA5-Land and Agri4Cast data sets, and data collected by locally deployed sensors to determine the extent to which open data sources can be used in precision agriculture.","","978-9-5318-4271-6","10.23919/ConTEL52528.2021.9495978","European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9495978","precision agriculture;open access data sources;sensor data;satellite data","Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Temperature distribution;Correlation;Open Access;Wind speed;Soil","","2","","19","","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The segmentation of structural components (e.g., leaves and stems) is a prerequisite for extracting phenotypic traits. In the past decade, there has been an increase in methods attempting to separate leaves and stems in point clouds. However, previous researches mainly focus on plants at the individual level due to the interlocked and overlapped nature of leaves and the bottleneck existing for field plants to extract phenotypic traits. To address this issue, a novel two-stage leaf–stem separation model encompassing the initial separation of leaves and stems and optimization is presented in this article. The model is based on the different geometric features of leaves and stems of maize plants defined by neighborhood points, and a cylinder is used to find the neighborhood points by considering the elongated characteristic of maize stems. After that, another elongated cylinder (0.5 m high and 0.02 m diameter) is used to traverse the stem points to optimize the initially separated results. Maize plants with the planting density of 45 000 plants/ha in the filling stage (Exp. 2019) were used to train and test the model in the initial separation step (Experiment 1), showing that the separation accuracy (SA) could be up to 91.3%. It was concluded that a 0.11-m-high and 0.07-m diameter cylinder was the optimal searching parameter for the initial separation and 0.25 m was the optimal threshold for optimization. We also tested the transferability of the model (Experiment 2) for maize plants with different planting densities (45 000, 67 500, 90 000, and 105 000 plants/ha), different growth stages (jointing, silking and filling), and point clouds collected using multiple platforms [terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), light detection and ranging (LiDAR) Backpack (LiBackpack), and unmanned aerial vehicle-LiDAR (UAV-LiDAR)], suggesting that the model performed well for all the datasets. In addition, the simulated datasets of maize with different planting densities were used to assess the model performance at the point level, showing the SA values were 0.92, 0.91, 0.91, and 0.90 for maize with the planting densities of 45 000, 67 500, 90 000, and 105 000 plants/ha, respectively. The proposed model in this study is innovative, and it has promising prospects for the high-throughput extraction of the phenotypic traits in field maize plants and could facilitate genotype selection in crop breeding and 3-D plant modeling.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3398135","Shaanxi Province Science and Technology Innovation Team(grant numbers:2021TD-51); Shaanxi Province Geoscience Big Data and Geohazard Prevention Innovation Team (2022); European Space Agency (ESA) through the ESA-the Ministry of Science and Technology (ESAMOST) DRAGON-5 Project(grant numbers:59339); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Chang’an University(grant numbers:300102260301,300102262902,300102262712); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFD2000102,2017YFE0122500); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10533662","Different cultivars;different growth stages;different planting densities;different platforms;light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data;simulated datasets;two-stage leaf–stem separation model","Vegetation mapping;Laser radar;Point cloud compression;Feature extraction;Agriculture;Data models;Data mining","","4","","46","IEEE","17 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to their long time span and high temporal frequency, model data could be used as a common reference for the rescaling. However, avoiding model dependence in observational climate data records is needed for some applications. In this article, the possibility of using as reference remote sensing data from one of the $L$-band sensors specifically designed to measure SM is discussed. Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 SM time series were rescaled by matching their cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) to those of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) NOAH model time series. The CDF computation was investigated as a function of the time series length, finding significant differences from four to nine years. Replacing temporal by spatial variance does not allow us to compute better CDFs from short time series. The rescaled time series show a high correlation ($R>0.8$) to the original ones and a low bias with respect to the reference ($< $0.03 m $^{3}\cdot$ m$^{-3}$). The time series rescaled using several SMOS or SMAP datasets were also evaluated against in situ measurements and show performances similar to or slightly better than those rescaled using the model GLDAS. The impact of random errors and gaps of the observational data into the rescaling was evaluated. These results show that it is actually possible to use $L$-band data as reference to rescale time series from other sensors to build long time series of SM.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3137008","European Space Agency; Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales TOSCA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657199","Advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2);cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching;L-band;long time series;soil moisture (SM);soil moisture active passive (SMAP);soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS)","Time series analysis;Data models;Meteorology;L-band;Remote sensing;Earth;Sensors","","6","","79","CCBY","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we present a framework that combines supervised learning for crop type classification on satellite imagery time-series with semantic web and linked data technologies to assist in the implementation of rule sets by the European common agricultural policy (CAP). The framework collects georeferenced data that are available online and satellite images from the Sentinel-2 mission. We analyze image time-series that cover the entire cultivation period and link each parcel with a specific crop. On top of that, we introduce a semantic layer to facilitate a knowledge-driven management of the available information, capitalizing on ontologies for knowledge representation and semantic rules, to identify possible farmers noncompliance according to the Greening 1 (crop diversification) and SMR 1 rule (protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates) rules of the CAP. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed integrated approach in three different scenarios for crop type monitoring and consistency checking for noncompliance to the CAP rules: the smart sampling of on-the-spot checks; the automatic detection of CAP's Greening 1 rule; and the automatic detection of susceptible parcels according to the CAP's SMR 1 rule.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3038152","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:832876,776019,693171); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9261931","Crop type classification;data fusion for decision-making;European Union (EU) common agricultural policy (CAP) noncompliance checking;linking earth observation (EO) data and web content;semantic enrichment","Agriculture;Semantics;Monitoring;Satellites;Earth;Geospatial analysis;Remote sensing","","20","","50","CCBY","17 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aim of this research, performed on a narrow tractor in vineyard mechanised activities, was therefore to evaluate a method for splitting raw data gathered from the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus into different clusters corresponding to specific tasks that can be carried out on the field such as tillage, fertilisation, shredding, treatments, defoliation and harvest. As the data could be associated to a specific task, further data mining showed possible errors, biases, noise and particular pattern in the dataset. As a result, a refined dataset of vineyard operations has been produced, plus additional information regarding tractor paths and idle times has been provided.

Increasing world population and climate change are setting new challenges to food production. Water stress can cause severe damage to crops, and detecting and preventing this threat is crucial. Smart agriculture and the use of sensors directly on the field is a promising and rapidly evolving solution. Data collected by a large number of sensors must be analyzed and efficiently interpreted. In this context, machine learning is an effective solution. This article conducts a comparative analysis of several well-established machine learning models, all trained on a dataset enriched with a novel parameter for the assessment of plant health, the stem electrical impedance (modulus and phase). This feature gives promising results since it is a direct parameter of the plant itself. Moreover, the inclusion of the stem impedance parameter significantly boosted the model's performance, notably enhancing the effectiveness, particularly evident in the case of the top-performing model in this study, the random forest algorithm. When incorporating stem electrical impedance, this model achieved an impressive F1 score of 98%, markedly surpassing the 88% obtained in its absence. As a complementary analysis, a permutation feature performance analysis was conducted, highlighting the potential of stem impedance modulus as a promising feature for evaluating plant watering conditions. The removal of impedance modulus from the training model resulted in an average classification performance loss of 25% in terms of F1 score, suggesting how impedance monitoring is a promising approach for plant health management.","2771-9529","","10.1109/TAFE.2024.3457156","Agritech National Research Center and received funding from the European Union Next-GenerationEU; PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPRESA E RESILIENZA (PNRR) MISSIONE 4 COMPONENTE 2, INVESTIMENTO 1.4 D.D. 1032 17/06/2022, CN00000022; National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP); Mission 4 - Component 2 - Investment 3.1 - Call for tender No. n. 3264 of 28/12/2021 of Italian Ministry of Research; European Union NextGenerationEU; Italian Ministry of Research(grant numbers:CUP: B33C22000710006); iENTRANCE; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10690239","Machine learning;plants monitoring;smart agriculture;stem impedance","Impedance;Machine learning;Data models;Support vector machines;Climate change;Plants (biology);Smart agriculture;Food security;Food products;Threat assessment","","1","","22","IEEE","24 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In IoT systems, if data management is entirely performed in the cloud, the system may not work correctly due to connectivity problems, which is common in some remote regions where the agribusiness thrives. A fog computing solution enables the IoT system to process data faster and deal with intermittent connectivity. However, a high number of packets sent from the fog to the cloud can cause link congestion with mostly useless data traffic. Dealing with fog data filtering is a challenge because it requires knowing which data is essential to send to the cloud. This paper proposes an approach to collect and store data in a smart agriculture environment and two different methods filtering data in the fog. We designed an experiment for each filtering method, using a real dataset containing temperature and humidity values. In both experiments, the fog filters the data using the k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) algorithm, which classifies data into categories according to their value ranges. In the first experiment, the fog classifies the data and generates an output of the number of data categories. In the second experiment, data is classified and also compressed based on the previously obtained categories using the runlength encoding (RLE) technique to preserve the data time series nature. Our results show that data filtering reduces the amount of data sent by the fog to the cloud.","","978-1-7281-8783-9","10.1109/MetroAgriFor50201.2020.9277661","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277661","smart agriculture;fog computing;Internet of things;data filtering;machine learning","Agriculture;Cloud computing;Sensors;Humidity;Edge computing;Training;Temperature distribution","","18","","17","IEEE","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method leverages the complementary information provided by the existing LC maps and recent acquisitions of HR Earth observation (EO) images to identify map units that have the highest probability of being correctly associated with their labels, and exploit the obtained “weak” training set to produce an updated HR LC map by classifying the recently acquired EO data. Both steps, performed at tile level, can be implemented on a high-performance computing (HPC) environment, which simultaneously process all required tiles (independently of each other) for the entire study area. The method was tested considering the publicly available 2018 Corine LC map having a minimum mapping unit of 25 ha and the Sentinel-2 images to generate an HR LC map of Italy.

Although popular tasks, such as scene classification, have received significant attention, the recent release of the Land-1.0 RS dataset marks the initiation of endeavors to estimate land-use and land-cover (LULC) fraction values per RGB satellite image. This challenging problem involves estimating LULC composition, i.e., the proportion of different LULC classes from satellite imagery, with major applications in environmental monitoring, agricultural/urban planning, and climate change studies. Currently, supervised deep learning models—the state-of-the-art in image classification—require large volumes of labeled training data to provide good generalization. To face the challenges posed by the scarcity of labeled RS data, self-supervised learning (SSL) models have recently emerged, learning directly from unlabeled data by leveraging the underlying structure. This is the first article to investigate the performance of SSL in LULC fraction estimation on RGB satellite patches using in-domain knowledge. We also performed a complementary analysis on LULC scene classification. Specifically, we pretrained Barlow Twins, MoCov2, SimCLR, and SimSiam SSL models with ResNet-18 using the Sentinel2GlobalLULC small RS dataset and then performed transfer learning to downstream tasks on Land-1.0. Our experiments demonstrate that SSL achieves competitive or slightly better results when trained on a smaller high-quality in-domain dataset of 194 877 samples compared to the supervised model trained on ImageNet-1k with 1 281 167 samples.

In this letter, the applicability of three snow density datasets, including European ReAnalysis (ERA)-Interim, ERA5, and the newly released ERA5-Land datasets, was first assessed using two ground evaluation datasets with different land covers from seven snow survey courses and four densely sampled networks in China. The results show that the ERA-Interim dataset significantly overestimates snow density during the entire snow season, with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) larger than 112 kg/m3, and lacks temporal dynamics. The ERA5 and ERA5-Land datasets are generally in good agreement with the ground measurements in China. The averaged RMSEs of the ERA5 dataset are 56.2 kg/m3 against snow course sites and 28.3 kg/m3 versus the densely sampled measurements, and those of the ERA5-Land dataset are 56.6 and 28.4 kg/m3, respectively. However, the ERA5 and ERA5-Land datasets still underestimate snow density over time, especially for the middle and late snow seasons.

Most agricultural studies and policies are carried out at the field level, for which precise boundaries are required. Today, high-resolution remote sensing images provide useful spatial information for plot delineation; however, manual processing is time-consuming and prone to human error. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential of deep learning (DL) approach, in particular a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, for the automatic outlining of agricultural plot boundaries from orthophotos over large areas with a heterogeneous landscape. Since DL approaches require a large amount of labeled data to learn, we have exploited the open data from the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) from the Chartered Community of Navarre, Spain. The boundaries of the agricultural plots obtained from our methodology were compared with those obtained using a state-of-the-art methodology known as gPb-UCM (global probability of boundary followed by ultrametric contour map) through an error measurement called the boundary displacement error index (BDE). In BDE terms, the results obtained by our method outperform those obtained from the gPb-UCM method.

The objective of this letter was to determine the surface roughness sample size required in synthetic aperture radar applications and to provide some guidelines on roughness characterization in agricultural soils for these applications. With this aim, a data set consisting of ten ENVISAT/ASAR observations acquired coinciding with soil moisture and surface roughness surveys has been processed. The analysis consisted of: 1) assessing the accuracies of roughness parameters s and l depending on the number of 1-m-long profiles measured per field; 2) computing the correlation of field average roughness parameters with backscatter observations; and 3) evaluating the goodness of fit of three widely used backscatter models, i.e., integral equation model (IEM), geometrical optics model (GOM), and Oh model. The results obtained illustrate a different behavior of the two roughness parameters. A minimum of 10-15 profiles can be considered sufficient for an accurate determination of s, while 20 profiles might still be not enough for accurately estimating l. The correlation analysis revealed a clear sensitivity of backscatter to surface roughness. For sample sizes >15 profiles, R values were as high as 0.6 for s and ~0.35 for l, while for smaller sample sizes R values dropped significantly. Similar results were obtained when applying the backscatter models, with enhanced model precision for larger sample sizes. However, IEM and GOM results were poorer than those obtained with the Oh model and more affected by lower sample sizes, probably due to larger uncertainly of l.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2017.2762434","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through scholarship and through MINECO/FEDER, EU(grant numbers:BES-2012-054521,CGL2011-24336,CGL2015-64284-C2-1-R,CGL2016-75217-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8088361","Agricultural soils;backscatter models;surface roughness;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Backscatter;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Correlation;Soil;Computational modeling;Mathematical model","","7","","15","IEEE","27 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Continuous and dense monitoring of crop condition and environmental parameters in the fields using various Internet of Things (IoT) devices creates Big Data for data-driven agriculture and provides the opportunity to address the above challenges. However, it is extremely complex to develop a large-scale system that integrates a variety of heterogeneous data sources to provide farmers and agronomists with simple and usable tools, such as assessing current field conditions, estimating crop stress levels, or determining the best time to apply certain cultivation practice. One of the solutions of this problem is to design and implement an interoperable IoT ecosystem for data-driven agriculture that turns the data from multiple sources into knowledge, giving rise to valuable insights and appropriate decisions based on the analysis of sensor measurements delivered from IoT devices. The paper presents the architecture and design of an ecosystem for data-driven agriculture which includes a cloud-native and microservice-based IoT platform.

This indicates the potential of impedance measurements as a non-invasive tool for early stress detection, although further refinement with additional environmental data and larger sample sizes is necessary. Future research will focus on enhancing the algorithm's accuracy by incorporating more diverse datasets, aiming to contribute to the development of an autonomous plant monitoring system for smart agriculture applications.","","979-8-3315-2730-3","10.1109/CAFE63183.2024.11069327","European Union Next-GenerationEU(grant numbers:CN00000022,IR0000027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11069327","Unsupervised learning;smart agriculture;food","Smart agriculture;Impedance measurement;Plants (biology);Time series analysis;Clustering algorithms;Classification algorithms;Impedance;Stress;Monitoring;Unsupervised learning","","","","18","IEEE","8 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High-resolution urban mapping is a valuable tool, which serves to map detailed categories. Such semantic data are integrated in national and regional administration as public goods. In the light of many countries around the globe making their data publicly available, we present a method to map urban areas based on multitemporal orthophotos and LiDAR-derived digital surface model, and extract information about vegetation in an automated processing chain. This approach is threshold driven and relies on an automatic generation of spectral thresholds and existing real-world-based classifications. We included cadastral data to add land-use information for specific categories, such as agricultural land use and to assess the product's accuracy. Adding these data creates an LULC product and makes a seamless integration into urban planning routines possible. The results of the study provide a detailed LULC map for the municipality of Aarhus in 2015 with a spatial resolution of 20 cm and ten thematic classes. Depending on the reference data, we achieved thematic overall accuracies of 34% and 64% using a polygon-based approach. Our study has found that utilizing both multitemporal orthophotos and elevation data can enhance the LC mapping of urban landscapes. The methodology could be transferred to other areas in Denmark or to countries providing similar datasets, and lends itself to a repeatable LULC mapping with minimal user interaction.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3289218","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; EC REGREEN-project Nature-Based Solutions in Europe and China towards Equitable, Green, and Healthy Cities(grant numbers:821016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10168752","Cadastre;digital orthophotos (DOP);object-based image analysis (OBIA);structural biodiversity;urban–rural fringe","Climate change;Image processing;Urban areas;Rural areas;Vegetation mapping;Urban planning;Surface treatment;Spatial resolution;Semantics;Resilience;Laser radar;Data models;Data mining","","3","","60","CCBY","29 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To restore the prosperity of the agricultural sector it is essential to detect and assess damages in agricultural fields and monitor their evolution. Commercial satellite data at very high spatial resolution $(\lt3 \mathrm{~m})$ such as sub-meter imagery acquired by Maxar’s WorldView and Planet Labs’ SkySat platforms allow detection and mapping of artillery craters at fine scale. However, the frequency of acquisition and geographical coverage of this type of data is limited and may be quite low, e.g., 1-2 scenes per agriculture season. With the aim to continuously monitor the state of the fields over large areas in Ukraine we must compliment the analysis with satellite data at lower spatial resolution, e.g., daily PlanetScope at $\sim 3-\mathrm{m}$ and 10-m Sentinel-2/MSI. Here, we propose a data fusion approach to monitor artillery craters in agricultural fields using combination of satellite images acquired at different spatial and temporal resolution. Specifically, we use a single-date SkySat image at 0.5-m resolution with crater detection using previously developed deep learning approach along with multi-temporal data acquired by PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images. For the latter, we detect anomalies of refelecant signal in the blue and green spectral bands and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). This approach is applied to a test area of 8,800 ha in Donetsk oblast. We found that with PlanetScope images at 3-m we were able to identify 202 ha of craters, or 63% of those in SkySat imagery; with Sentinel-2 at 10-m we detected 165 ha (or 51%) of craters. Craters with an area smaller than $100 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ were poorly detected. By analyzing anomalies in multi-temporal PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images, we were able to identify craters that were not detected in SkySat data highlighting the importance of temporal component in the data. Furthermore, with daily PlanetScope data combined with Sentinel-2 data (3-5 days), we were able to estimate the dates of crater appearances and analyze the dynamics of craters and their evolution.","","979-8-3503-9611-9","10.1109/DESSERT61349.2023.10416533","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10416533","damage on agricultural fields;freely and commercial satellite data;Sentinel-2;PlanetScope;SkySat;machine learning;anomaly detection;history of craters","Satellites;Planets;Satellite images;Image restoration;Spatial resolution;Monitoring;Signal resolution","","1","","19","IEEE","6 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, a combined approach based on the use of multispectral imagery, acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, and statistical models was applied for determining the water status of a citrus orchard during different phenological stages, with respect to traditional stem water potential (SWP) measurements. Specifically, the suitability of individual spectral bands and vegetation indices was firstly evaluated, followed by the implementation of statistical methods (i.e., stepwise linear regression models and principal component regression) using the UAV information as explanatory variables. The results showed a weak correlation between the spectral bands and the SWP during the fruit rapid growth stage. A stronger relationship was observed instead when the vegetation indices were used, during the same phenological stage, but with low Pearson coefficients of correlation, varying from -0.31 to -0.46. The SWP estimated by the statistical methods resulted more reliable, with average mean absolute error, root mean square error and percent bias values ranging from 0.17 to 0.19 MPa, from 0.23 to 0.24 MPa and from -0.38 to -0.59%, respectively.

Two hydrological variables retrieved from satellite data, actual evapotranspiration ($ET_{a}$) and soil moisture ($SM$), showed the best results when used for classification, especially when combined together, retrieving a final accuracy of $90.1 \pm 2.7\%$. All the three ML models employed for the classification showed that they were able to distinguish different irrigation systems, regardless of the different crops present in each field.

In a context of ecosystems, data governance becomes important, but its relative importance as an adoption factor is yet unclear.

This paper introduces an innovative approach for crop field segmentation in high-resolution satellite images, leveraging the use of multi-temporal Canny edge detection to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully automate the segmentation process. The Canny filter, applied to Sentinel-2 multi-temporal data, provides refined input for training ResUnet models, facilitating the generation of a generalized training dataset. ResUnet allows the model to learn complex features from diverse data, encapsulating seasonal changes. The dataset was specifically designed to enable the model to make accurate predictions from a single image, significantly outperforming traditional Canny filter predictions. In addition, the ResUnet may be applied to multiple images, generating output masks that, when overlayed, produce better results with respect to the multi-temporal Canny approach, demonstrating superior ability in recognizing real field boundaries while reducing false detections.To enhance generalizability, ResUnet is trained on a varied global dataset capturing a wide range of agricultural conditions and seasonal variations. This generalized model is tested across different regions and seasons, and preliminary results indicate that the proposed approach offers operational efficiency and accuracy in automating crop field segmentation.","2153-7003","979-8-3503-6032-5","10.1109/IGARSS53475.2024.10641103","European Space Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10641103","U-Net;ResUNet;Crop-field Segmentation;deep-learning;canny edge detection;watershed;Sentinel-2;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)","Training;Image segmentation;Adaptation models;Accuracy;Image edge detection;Crops;Predictive models","","1","","11","IEEE","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among them is the systematic classification of land cover types based on the patterns of settlements or agriculture recorded by SAR imagers, in particular the identification and quantification of temporal changes. A systematic (re)classification shall allow the assignment of continuously updated semantic content labels to local image patches. This necessitates a careful selection of well-defined and discernible categories being contained in the image data that have to be trained and validated. These steps are well-established for optical images, while the peculiar imaging characteristics of SAR sensors often prevent a comparable approach. Especially, the vast range of SAR imaging parameters and the diversity of local targets impact the image product characteristics and need special care. In the following, we present guidelines and practical examples of how to obtain reliable image patch classification results for time series data with a limited number of given training data. We demonstrate that one can avoid the generation of simulated training data if we decompose the classification task into physically meaningful subsets of characteristic target properties and important imaging parameters. Then, the results obtained during training can serve as benchmarking figures for subsequent image classification. This holds for typical remote sensing examples such as coastal monitoring or the characterization of urban areas where we want to understand the transitions between individual land cover categories. For this purpose, a representative dataset can be obtained from the authors. A final proof of our concept is the comparison of classification results of selected target areas obtained by rather different SAR instruments.

However, crop-damaging pests compromise yields, jeopardizing the benefits of PA. Computer vision-based pest detection techniques offer promising avenues to overcome potential losses for farmers. The recent object detection framework, YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) applied to real-time insect monitoring is an open-source, cutting-edge PA approach based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that enables precise and quick decision making in agricultural crops. Under this umbrella, traditional pest studies using YOLO or other deep-learning solutions focused on only one or a few insects for specific crops provide an excessively narrow solution.

Precision agriculture seeks analytic tools at near single plant level, and this work explores how to improve aerial photogrammetry to enable inter-day precision agriculture analytics for intervals of up to a month.Our work starts by presenting an accurately registered image time series, captured up to twice a week, by an unmanned aerial vehicle over a wheat crop field. The dataset is registered using photogrammetry aided by fiducial ground control points (GCPs). Unfortunately, GCPs severely disrupt crop management activities. To address this, we propose a novel inter-day registration approach that only relies once on GCPs, at the beginning of the season.The method utilises LoFTR [1], a state-of-the-art image-matching transformer. The original LoFTR network was trained using imagery of outdoor urban areas. One of our contributions is to extend LoFTR’s training method, which uses matching images of a static scene, to a dynamic scene of plants undergoing growth. Another contribution is a thorough evaluation of our registration method that integrates intraday crop reconstruction with earlier-day scans in a seven degree-of-freedom alignment.

However, the limited ability of thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing to penetrate cloud cover has hindered the widespread application of TIR LST datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel reconstruction approach for cloud-covered pixels, which is established based on the annual surface temperature cycle. It shifted the previous reconstruction from directly modeling LST to indirectly modeling the residual term derived from the LST observations and the annual temperature cycle (ATC) model fit values. A random forest regression (RFR) was used to build this estimation model and the model was applied to cloud-covered pixels to derive their LSTs. Taking the Iberian Peninsula as the study area, the proposed method was applied to generate the all-weather LST product for the whole year 2021. The visual assessment demonstrates its robust performance across different seasons and weather conditions. Additionally, through the validation with the masked clear-sky LST observations, it reveals that the proposed method achieves a stable estimation accuracy, with the average value of the coefficient of determination ( ${R} ^{2}$ ) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of above 0.8 and 1.08 K under different climatic conditions. In comparison, the validation with the ERA-5 land reanalysis data also indicates a relatively good consistency between the performance of the reconstructed LST and the clear-sky LST, although with a slight decline in  ${R} ^{2}$  and RMSE. Additionally, the indirect validation with near-surface air temperature (NSAT) also shows the comparable ability of the reconstructed LST in NSAT estimation as the clear-sky LST, with an increase of RMSE no more than 0.95 K. In general, the proposed method shows good potential in reconstructing cloud-covered LSTs with relatively stable performance under different cloud-cover conditions and it can be applied for generating all-weather LST products.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3377670","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42222109,42071349); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFA0608702); West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XBZG-ZDSYS-202202); European Union Next GenerationEU (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR) Missione 4 Componente 2, Investimento 1.4 903—D.D. 1032 17/06/2022)(grant numbers:CN00000022); Science and Technology Research Program of the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment(grant numbers:IMHE-CXTD-02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10473177","Annual surface temperature cycle;land surface temperature (LST);Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);random forest regression (RFR);reconstruction","Land surface temperature;Climate change;Random forests;Surface treatment;Image resolution;Spectroradiometers;MODIS;Global warming;Meteorology;Surface reconstruction;Spatial resolution;Remote sensing;Clouds","","10","","64","IEEE","19 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we analyze the reliability of a harvest-readiness classifier with interpretable machine learning. By identifying clusters of saliency maps, we derive reliability scores for each classification result using knowledge about the domain and the image properties. For unseen data, the reliability can be used to 1) inform farmers to improve their decision-making and 2) increase the model prediction accuracy. Using RGB images of single cauliflower plants at different developmental stages from the GrowliFlower dataset, we investigate various saliency mapping approaches and find that they result in different quality of reliability scores.

Within this context, we propose a deep learning-based feature extraction method for the identification of plant species and the classification of plant leaf diseases. We focus on results relevant to real-time processing scenarios that can be easily transferred to manned/unmanned agricultural smart machinery (e.g. tractors, drones, robots, IoT smart sensor networks, etc.) by reconsidering the common processing pipeline.

For the experimental evaluation, we used publicly available datasets consisting of RGB textured images and datasets containing images of healthy and non-healthy plant leaves of different species. We compared our method to feature vectors derived from traditional handcrafted feature extraction descriptors computed for the same images and end-to-end deep-learning approaches.

Previous studies have shown important scale issues that compromise the measurement and parameterization of roughness especially in agricultural soils. The objective of this paper was to determine the roughness scales involved in the backscattering process over agricultural soils. With this aim, a database of 132 5-m profiles taken on agricultural soils with different tillage conditions was used. These measurements were acquired coinciding with a series of ENVISAT/ASAR observations. Roughness profiles were processed considering three different scaling issues: 1) influence of measurement range; 2) influence of low-frequency roughness components; and 3) influence of high-frequency roughness components. For each of these issues, eight different roughness parameters were computed and the following aspects were evaluated: 1) roughness parameters values; 2) correlation with σ0; and 3) goodness-of-fit of the Oh model. Most parameters had a significant correlation with σ0 especially the fractal dimension, the peak frequency, and the initial slope of the autocorrelation function. These parameters had higher correlations than classical parameters such as the standard deviation of surface heights or the correlation length. Very small differences were observed when longer than 1-m profiles were used as well as when small-scale roughness components (<;5 cm) or large-scale roughness components (>100 cm) were disregarded. In conclusion, the medium-frequency roughness components (scale of 5-100 cm) seem to be the most influential scales in the radar backscattering process on agricultural soils.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2717043","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO/FEDER, EU)(grant numbers:BES-2012-054521,CGL2011-24336,CGL2015-64284-C2-1-R,CGL2016-75217-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7971991","Agriculture;rough surface;scattering;soil;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Soil;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Soil measurements;Backscatter;Synthetic aperture radar;Sensors","","19","","57","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The investigated area is characterized by heterogeneous land cover types made up of natural and agricultural lands. To identify different levels of fire severity without using fixed thresholds, we applied SOM to the three spectral indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized burn ratio (NBR), and burned area index for sentinel (BAIS) used to enhance burned areas. This is a particular critical issue because fixed threshold values are generally not suitable for fragmented landscapes, vegetation types, and geographic regions different from those for which they were devised. To cope with this issue, the methodological approach herein proposed is based on three steps: 1) indices computation; 2) maps of the difference of the three indices computed using the data acquired from prefire and postfire occurrences; and 3) unsupervised classification obtained processing all the difference maps using the SOM.

Our results showed that applying transfer learning to Inception ResNet improved minimum mean average percentage error from 45.58% on a basic CNN, to 28.07% on biomass, and from 29.33% to 8.03% on moisture content. From scratch models and models optimised for mobile remote sensing applications (MobileNet) failed to produce the same level of improvement.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553222","European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553222","grassland biomass;Inception ResNet;MobileNet;proximal sensing;transfer learning","Deep learning;Volume measurement;Biological system modeling;Transfer learning;Estimation;Moisture;Vegetation mapping","","1","","9","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These pests interact with their hosts and the environment through complex pathways, and it is increasingly common to find professionals from different areas gathering into projects that attempt to deal with this complexity. We propose a framework called FramePests guiding steps and activities for crop pest modeling and forecasting. From theoretical references about carrying out mappings and systematic reviews of the literature, the framework proposes a series of steps leading to a state of science as a knowledge base for modeling tasks. Then, two modeling solutions, based on data and knowledge are used. Finally, the model outputs and performances are compared. The application of the proposed framework was demonstrated for coffee leaf rust modeling, for which we obtained a data-based model built using a gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) with a mean absolute error of 7.19% and a knowledge-based model represented by a hierarchical multi-criteria decision structure with an accuracy of 56.03%. A complementary study for our case study allowed us to explore how elements of a data-based model can improve a knowledge-based model, improving its accuracy by 7.07%. and showed that knowledge-based modeling can be an alternative to data-based modeling when the available dataset has approximately 60 instances. Data-based models tend to have better performance, but their replicability is conditioned by the diversity in the dataset used. Knowledge-based models may be simpler but allow expert supervision, and these models are not usually tied to specific sites.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104537","Doctoral Program of Telematics Engineering and the Telematics Engineering Group (GIT) of the University of Cauca; “Programa Centroamericano de Gestión Integral de la Roya del Café (PROCAGICA)” through the EU(grant numbers:DCI-ALA/2015/365-17); Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center (CATIE); InnovAccion Cauca Project of the Colombian Science, Technology and Innovation Fund (SGR-CTI) through the Ph.D. Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9513290","Crop pest forecasting;data-based model;knowledge-based model;smart farming","Data models;Agriculture;Knowledge based systems;Systematics;Predictive models;Analytical models;Forecasting","","3","","61","CCBY","13 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior to applying these models, image preprocessing techniques are applied in order to improve the detection results. However, there is a lack of computational comparisons on the application of different image preprocessing techniques before applying object detection algorithms for plant disease detection. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a computational comparison of seven different image preprocessing techniques (auto-orientation, object isolation, resizing, grayscale conversion, static crop, contrast adjustment, tiling) applied prior to the execution of two state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, one single-stage detector, YOLOV5, and one two-stage detector, Faster-RCNN. We investigate whether or not these preprocessing techniques improve the accuracy, training time, and inference time, of plant disease detection. Apart from comparing these techniques solely, we also perform combinations of the preprocessing techniques. The PlantDoc dataset was used for this experimental study. Computational results show that the best method improves the mean average precision by 9% and 3% for YOLOv5 and Faster-RCNN, respectively. Finally, the combination of all seven preprocessing techniques yields an improvement of about 13% in the mean average precision of both object detectors.","","979-8-3503-9858-8","10.1109/SEEDA-CECNSM57760.2022.9932972","European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9932972","Object recognition;neural nets;model classification.","Training;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Neural networks;Europe;Object detection;Detectors","","2","","25","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, the early detection of production anomalies is fundamental for animal health and safety. In this work, two numerical methods for detecting daily milk production anomalies are presented and applied to three different farms selected as case studies. The methods described in this paper provide a numerical procedure having the scope of detecting milk yield anomalies. Both the algorithms presented hereinafter are based on statistical calculations and take as input daily resting time and daily milk yield recorded respectively by the pedometers worn by the cows and by the automatic milking system of the barns. The first method take into consideration two indicators, namely the Difference in Relative Production (DRP) and the Daily Rest time (DR). DRP is defined as the relative difference in daily milk yield between real-time data of a single animal and a baseline curve considered as an ideal trend. An anomaly (i.e. a deviation from the normal value) is determined, for a single cow, for a specific day, if two conditions on DRP and DR are contemporary verified. In the second method, starting from the Wood function, maybe the most famous model to fit the production of the cow in dependence of day in milk, the concept of reliability of robust statistics has been introduced in order to obtain, for each animal, a more solid and realistic lactation curve since not affected by outlier values.","","979-8-3503-1272-0","10.1109/MetroAgriFor58484.2023.10424227","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10424227","PLF;Dairy cattle;Big Data;Automatic milking system;Anomaly detection","Training;Dairy products;Animals;Production;Cows;Real-time systems;Agriculture","","","","17","IEEE","12 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our results show that the range accuracy between instruments is comparable and within the manufacturer's specifications. This means that the spatial XYZ data of different instruments can be combined into a single data set. Our findings demonstrate that radiometric calibration is instrument specific and needs to be carried out for each instrument individually before including reflectance information in TLS analysis.

Standard methods for feature selection in machine learning seldom take into account the domain knowledge associated with the data. Multitemporal crop classification studies with full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data ought to consider the changes in the scattering mechanisms with their phenological growth stages. Hence, it is desirable to incorporate these changes while determining a feature subset for classification. In this study, a random forest (RF) based feature selection technique is proposed that takes into account the changes in the physical scattering mechanism with crop phenological stages for multitemporal PolSAR classification. The partial probability plot, which is an attribute of RF, provides information about the marginal effect of a polarimetric parameter on the desired crop class. Moreover, it is used to identify the specific range of a parameter where the probability of the presence of a particular crop class is high. The proposed technique identifies features that change significantly with crop phenology. The selected features are the ones whose ranges show maximum separation amongst crop classes. Additionally, the feature subset is refined by eliminating correlated features. The E-SAR L-band dataset of the AgriSAR-2006 campaign over the Demmin test site in Germany is used in this study. The classification accuracy using the novel feature selection technique is 99.12%. This is nominally better than using the features obtained from a standard feature selection method used in RF, such as mean decrease Gini (98.73%) and mean decrease accuracy (98.68%) that do not take into account the information based on crop phenology.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2866407","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, in part by the State Agency of Research (AEI); European Funds for Regional Development(grant numbers:TIN2014-55413-C2-2-P,TEC2017-85244-C2-1-P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8474340","Classification;crop;feature selection;multitemporal;phenology;polarimetric random forest (RF);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Agriculture;Scattering;Feature extraction;Radio frequency;Synthetic aperture radar;Standards;L-band","","50","","48","IEEE","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The retrieval of all scene parameters involved in the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model (i.e., ground topography, vegetation height, extinction, and ground-to-volume ratios) is affected by this term when the radar response from the ground is dominated by the DB. The estimation error in all these parameters is analyzed by means of simulations over a wide range of system configurations and scene variables for both agricultural crops and forest scenarios. Simulations demonstrate that the inclusion of the DB term, which complicates the inversion algorithm, is necessary for the angles of incidence shallower than 30° to achieve an estimation error below 10% in vegetation height and to avoid a significant underestimation in the ground-to-volume ratios. At steep incidences, this decorrelation term does not affect the estimation of vegetation height and ground-to-volume ratios. Regarding the extinction, this parameter is intrinsically not well estimated, since most retrieved values are close to the initial guesses employed for the optimization algorithm, regardless of the use or not of the DB decorrelation term. Finally, these findings are compared with the experimental results from the TanDEM-X data acquired over the rice fields in Spain for the available system parameters (baseline and incidence angle) of the acquired data set.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.2981756","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, the State Agency of Research (AEI); European Funds for Regional Development (EFRD)(grant numbers:TEC2017-85244-C2-1-P); Generalitat Valenciana; European Social Fund (ESF)(grant numbers:ACIF/2018/204); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9050464","Agriculture;bistatic radar;double bounce (DB);forest;polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR);rice;TanDEM-X;vegetation","Coherence;Vegetation mapping;Decorrelation;Estimation;Agriculture;Forestry","","9","","42","IEEE","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional agroforestry parklands are a farmer- and nature-based widespread form of ecological intensification which randomly integrates trees into crop fields. While most studies estimating crop yields in agroforestry have been conducted in controlled experimental settings, few have addressed the inherent variability in such highly heterogeneous systems. Thus, the purpose of this study is to benefit from a UAV-based proxy-sensing and machine learning approach to address the variability of pearl millet grain yield, according to the distance to randomly distributed trees in a traditional agroforestry system dominated by Faidherbia albida (i.e. groundnut basin of Senegal). 21 vegetation indices (VIs), 32 normalized difference texture indices (NDTIs) derived from multispectral drone images, and normalization variables for radiative conditions were used with yield data collected in 15 plots (around 1 ha each) and subplots ( $15~m^{2} $  each) displayed at 3 distances from the tree over five cropping seasons (2018–2022). In this context, the optimal phenological stage was determined for predicting pearl millet grain yield, which proved to be the pre-heading period. This period was used as the basis for our machine learning model training dataset in the subplots. Two models, Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) were compared by combining VIs, NDTIs and normalization variables. GBM was the best-performing model, explaining 78% of observed pearl millet yield variability over five years in the subplots, with a RMSE of 16 g. $m^{-2} $ . This study revealed that NDTIs calculated from red and green bands were more influential for yield estimation than those based on near-infrared. These results were subsequently used to predict yield in all plots, resulting in a mean relative error of 17.5% between yields estimated by the farmers and GBM-estimated yields. This approach represents a pathway to assessing the withinfield yield variability in highly heterogeneous agroforestry plots and to demonstrate, quantify and optimize tree benefits for ecological intensification.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3460107","SustainSahl Project of Europen Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation(grant numbers:861974); “Faidherbia-Flux” platform through by Centre de coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD), UMR Eco&Sols, Laboratoire mixte international Intensification Ecologique des sols cultivés en Afrique de L’Ouest (LMI IELSOL), Institut Sénégalais de Recherche Agricole (ISRA), CERAAS, and several on-going projects, such as EU-LeapAgri RAMSES II; Agropolis and Total Foundation DSCATT; EU-DESIRA CASSECS; and CIRAD-CRESI-ELISA; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Equipment through EU-H2020 SustainSAHEL(grant numbers:861974); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10680013","Agroforestry;drone;heterogeneity;multispectral;machine learning;upscaling;yield","Climate change;Forestry;Multispectral imaging;Machine learning;Food security;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Vegetation mapping;Radio frequency;Crop yield;Distributed databases;Drones;Random forests","","1","","83","CCBY","13 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Solutions vary from physical modeling, and long-term observations, to short-term measurements. In this article, we consider a common approach for water current prediction that uses Lagrangian floaters for water current prediction by interpolating the trajectory of the elements to reflect the velocity field. Here, an important aspect that has not been addressed before is where to initially deploy the drifting elements such that the acquired velocity field would efficiently represent the water current. To that end, we use a clustering approach that relies on a physical model of the velocity field. Our method segments the modeled map and determines the deployment locations as those that will lead the floaters to “visit” the center of the different segments. This way, we validate that the area covered by the floaters will capture the inhomogeneity of the velocity field. Exploration over a dataset of velocity field maps that span over a year demonstrates the applicability of our approach, and shows a considerable improvement over the common approach of uniformly randomly choosing the initial deployment sites.

The model is trained on the labelled dataset of glacial lakes for semantic segmentation of true color images into two relevant classes: lake and no lake. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using intersection over union (IoU) score.

A key goal of this study is creating a database of nozzle properties. Five stainless steel flat fan nozzles (Tee Jet, USA) were chosen according to the ISO 25358 standard, which defines spray classes according to droplet size spectra from Very Fine (VF) to Ultra Coarse (UC). A hydraulic test bench was employed to replicate spraying conditions precisely under controlled settings. The nozzles were tested at three different distances from the system's field of view (0 cm, ±3.5 cm, and ±7 cm from the nozzle cone's center axis) keeping the pressure conditions as requested by the standard. As expected, the results show that the cumulative volume percentage increases as the droplet diameter increases showing a sigmoidal trend for each nozzle type. The VF/ F nozzle produced the smallest droplets, with Dv10, Dv50, and Dv90 values of $\mathbf{68.2}\ \boldsymbol{\mu} \mathbf{m}, \mathbf{137.64}\ \boldsymbol{\mu} \mathbf{m}$, and 194.68 $\boldsymbol{\mu}\mathbf{m}$ respectively. Conversely, the VC/UC nozzle generated the largest droplets, with Dv10, Dv50, and Dv90 values of 138.46 $\boldsymbol{\mu}\mathbf{m}, \mathbf{399.42}\ \boldsymbol{\mu}\mathbf{m}$, and $\mathbf{724.04}\ \boldsymbol{\mu}\mathbf{m}$. The variability in droplet size distributions was evident from the distribution of droplet sizes, emphasizing the significance of nozzle selection in minimizing spray drift. The obtained datasets will aid in referring each nozzle analyzed in our laboratory with our custom equipment to the standard classification, allowing objective comparison of nozzle performance toward the optimization of spray application.","","979-8-3503-5544-4","10.1109/MetroAgriFor63043.2024.10948849","European Union(grant numbers:CN00000022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10948849","Agricultural spray;droplet size;N60 shadowgraph;nozzles classification;spray characterization;ISO 25358","Precision agriculture;ISO Standards;Spraying;Pesticides;Market research;Size measurement;Pressure measurement;Steel;Protection;Standards","","","","27","IEEE","11 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Within retrieval workflows for real-time mapping over agricultural regions, such crop-specific information products need to be derived precisely and rapidly. To allow fast processing, intelligent sampling schemes for training databases should be incorporated to establish efficient machine learning (ML) models. In this study, we implemented active learning (AL) heuristics using kernel ridge regression (KRR) to minimize and optimize a training database for variational heteroscedastic Gaussian processes regression (VHGPR) to estimate aboveground N content. Several uncertainty and diversity criteria were applied on a lookup table (LUT) composed of aboveground N content and corresponding hyperspectral reflectance simulated by the PROSAIL-PRO model. The best-performing AL criteria were Euclidian distance-based diversity (EBD) resulting in a reduction of the LUT training data set by 81% (50 initial samples plus 141 samples selected from a pool of 1000 samples). This reduced LUT was used for training VHGPR, which is not only a competitive algorithm but also provides uncertainty estimates. Validation against in situ N reference data provided excellent results with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.84 g/m2 and a coefficient of determination ( $R^{2}$ ) of 0.92. Mapping aboveground N content over an agricultural region yielded reliable estimates and meaningful associated uncertainties. These promising results encourage the transfer of such hybrid workflows into space and time within the frame of future operational N monitoring from satellite imaging spectroscopy data.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2020.3014676","European Research Council (ERC) through the ERC-2017-STG SENTIFLEX Project(grant numbers:755617); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the SynerTGE CGL2015-G9095-R (MINECO/FEDER, UE) Project; ESA FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) Calibration/Validation Campaign FLEXSense 2018(grant numbers:ESA RFP/3-15477/18/NL/NA); Ramón y Cajal Contract (Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities); German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy(grant numbers:50EE1623); Space Agency of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) within the Research Project EnMAP Scientific Advisory Group Phase III: Developing the EnMAP Managed Vegetation Scientific Processor; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9169812","Active learning (AL);Gaussian processes (GP);hybrid retrieval methods;kernel ridge regression (KRR);nitrogen","Table lookup;Training;Vegetation mapping;Uncertainty;Nitrogen;Imaging;Spectroscopy","","57","","40","IEEE","17 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While deep-learning-based semantic segmentation approaches have reached outstanding performance in recent years, they demand large amounts of labeled data for training. Inspired by modern Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques, in this paper, we introduce a two-step training pipeline specifically tailored to challenging natural scenes, where the availability of annotated data is often quite limited. Our strategy involves the initial training of a powerful domain adaptive architecture, followed by a refinement stage, where segmentation masks predicted by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) are used to improve the accuracy of the predictions on the target dataset. These refined predictions serve as pseudo-labels to supervise the training of a final distilled architecture for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments conducted in two real-world scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we show that our pipeline enables the training of a MobileNetV3 that achieves significant mIoU gains of 3.60% and 11.40% on our two datasets compared to the DAFormer while only demanding 1/15 of the latter’s inference time.

Most modern trackers rely on the appearance of objects rather than motion for association, which can be ineffective when most targets are static objects with the same appearance, as in the agricultural case. To this end, on the trail of SORT [5], we propose AgriSORT, a simple, online, real-time tracking-by-detection pipeline for precision agriculture based only on motion information that allows for accurate and fast propagation of tracks between frames. The main focuses of AgriSORT are efficiency, flexibility, minimal dependencies, and ease of deployment on robotic platforms. We test the proposed pipeline on a novel MOT benchmark specifically tailored for the agricultural context, based on video sequences taken in a table grape vineyard, particularly challenging due to strong self-similarity and density of the instances.

However, these approaches suffer from two main problems, i.e., identifying the most significant PoIs inside the greenhouse and placing a sensor at each PoI, which may be costly and incompatible with field operations. As regards the first problem, we propose a genetic algorithm to identify the best sensing places based on the agronomic definition of zones of interest.

Recently, the use of robots in agriculture and automatic gardening has created new challenges due to the highly repetitive appearance with prevalent green color and repetitive texture of garden-like scenes. The lack of available data recorded in gardens or plant fields makes difficult to improve localization algorithms for such environments. In this paper, we propose a new data set of garden images for testing algorithms for visual place recognition.

We also provide ground truth for all possible pairs of images, indicating whether they depict the same place or not.

Some agricultural environments present harsh conditions to robotics operability. In the case of steep slope vineyards, there are several challenges: terrain irregularities, characteristics of illumination, and inaccuracy/unavailability of signals emitted by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Under these conditions, robotics navigation becomes a challenging task. To perform these tasks safely and accurately, the extraction of reliable features or landmarks from the surrounding environment is crucial. This work intends to solve this issue, performing accurate, cheap, and fast landmark extraction in steep slope vineyard context. To do so, we used a single camera and an Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) provided by Google's USB Accelerator as a small, high-performance, and low power unit suitable for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The proposed approach performs object detection using Deep Learning (DL)-based Neural Network (NN) models on this device to detect vine trunks. To train the models, Transfer Learning (TL) is used on several pre-trained versions of MobileNet V1 and MobileNet V2. A benchmark between the two models and the different pre-trained versions is performed. The models are pre-trained in a built in-house dataset, that is publicly available containing 336 different images with approximately 1,600 annotated vine trunks. There are considered two vineyards, one using camera images with the conventional infrared filter and others with an infrablue filter. Results show that this configuration allows a fast vine trunk detection, with MobileNet V2 being the most accurate retrained detector, achieving an overall Average Precision of 52.98%. We briefly compare the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art Tiny YOLO-V3 running on Jetson TX2, showing the outperformance of the adopted system in this work.

The maps built using robots of different types show differences in size, resolution, and scale, the associated geolocation data may be inaccurate and biased while the repetitiveness of both visual appearance and geometric structures found within agricultural contexts render classical map merging techniques ineffective. In this letter, we propose AgriColMap, a novel map registration pipeline that leverages a grid-based multimodal environment representation, which includes a vegetation index map and a digital surface model. We cast the data association problem between maps built from UAVs and UGVs as a multimodal, large displacement dense optical flow estimation. The dominant, coherent flows, selected using a voting scheme, are used as point-to-point correspondences to infer a preliminary nonrigid alignment between the maps. A final refinement is then performed, by exploiting only meaningful parts of the registered maps. We evaluate our system using real-world data for three fields with different crop species.

However, Vietnam is located in tropical regions where their conditions are impacted by strong atmosphere. The aim of this article is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of the X-band for estimating the ground subsidence under tropical atmospheric conditions. Analysis is carried out on two stacks, TerraSAR-X and Cosmos SkyMed X-band, from 2011 to 2014 in Ha Noi. We show that the results on the ground subsidence from InSAR processing can describe consistently the subsidence area based on ground measurements. This article demonstrates that the InSAR technique can be effective at detecting and estimating the subsidence phenomena even with the X-band and under conditions typical of tropical regions. The displacement results from TerraSAR-X and Cosmos SkyMed datasets are consistent, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.91 for the period during which their coverage overlaps. Groundwater overexploitation is one of the main causes of the ground subsidence in Ha Noi.

Our objective is to develop an AI-based application that provides pruning suggestions according to the “gentle pruning” strategy enabling non-experts in the field to easily engage in the process. To achieve that, we have to deal with multiple challenges such as a large number of grapevine varieties, complicated outdoor conditions characterized by varied light, weather and complex grapevine structures with multiple occlusions. In this work, we present a framework, which allows the generation of pruning suggestions using a video recorded by a smartphone and visualize them in a mobile AR application. Thus, our contributions are the following: 1) we present the collection of a large image segmentation dataset of dormant grapevines; 2) we propose a novel distributed approach to generate pruning suggestions via a semantic 3D grapevine model generated from a smartphone video; 3) we propose a mobile AR application to visualize the pruning suggestions.

However, it is challenging to register images across different data-collection days, especially across seasons, due to the self-occluding geometry and temporal dynamics in forests and orchards. This paper proposes a new approach for registering under-canopy image sequences in general and in these situations. Our methodology leverages standard GPS data and deep-learning-based perspective to bird’s-eye view conversion to provide an initial estimation of the positions of the trees in images and their association across datasets. Furthermore, it introduces an innovative strategy for extracting tree trunks and clean ground surfaces from noisy and sparse 3D reconstructions created from the image sequences, utilizing these features to achieve precise alignment. Our robust alignment method effectively mitigates position and scale drift, which may arise from GPS inaccuracies and Sparse Structure from Motion (SfM) limitations. We evaluate our approach on three challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating that our method outperforms ICP-based methods on average by 50%, and surpasses FGR and TEASER++ by over 90% in alignment accuracy.

Rainfall data mostly have high inconstancy and irregular patterns which are rare in other time series data. The rainfall data changes greatly with time, so the time factor has a high importance in such time series data. In order to develop efficient forecast models, one should deeply analyze the effect of time on prediction accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze how early we can predict a rainfall event with accuracy. We have performed the experiments on a 5-year daily rainfall data obtained from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-day prior forecasting horizons using a machine learning technique to observe the trends in the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we have also identified some most important input features from the dataset which plays a major role in the prediction of a rainfall event.

However, accurately counting fruits poses challenges, particularly due to occlusions. This study proposes a multi-view sensing approach using continuous motion videos captured by a camera moved along the row of trees, followed by fruit detection in all video frames and application of Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) algorithms to prevent double-counting. Three tracking methods, namely SORT, DeepSORT, and ByteTrack, are compared for fruit counting using the YOLOv5x object detector. The methodology is applied to map fruit production in an experimental apple orchard at two different dates: four weeks and one week before harvest. The results demonstrate that ByteTrack (MOTA=0.682; IDF1=0.837; HOTA=0.689) outperforms SORT and DeepSORT, indicating its superior tracking performance. Computational efficiency analysis reveals similar processing times between SORT and ByteTrack (about 15 ms), while DeepSORT requires significantly more processing time per image (128 ms). Fruit counting evaluation shows reasonably accurate yield predictions on both dates, with reduced errors and improved performance closer to the harvest date (MAPE=7.47 %; $R^{2}$=0.70). The system proves effective in estimating orchard fruit production using computer vision technology, offering valuable insights for yield forecasting.

The HDMR technique is first adopted to estimate a regression model with all available polarimetric features for each biophysical parameter, and sensitivity indices of each feature are then derived to explain the original space with a smaller number of features in which a final regression model is established. To evaluate the applicability of this methodology, root-mean square and coefficient of determination were performed under different amounts of samples. Results highlight that HDMR can be used effectively in biophysical variable estimation for not only reducing computational cost but also for providing a robust regression.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2019.2891953","Scientific Research Projects Coordination of Istanbul Technical University(grant numbers:39807,MGA-2018-41152); Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness; State Agency of Research (AEI); European Funds for Regional Development (FEDER)(grant numbers:TEC2017-85244-C2-1-P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8632689","Agriculture;global sensitivity analysis (GSA);polarimetry;Radarsat-2;synthetic aperture radar","Agriculture;Biological system modeling;Estimation;Sensitivity analysis;Monitoring;Indexes","","18","","18","IEEE","1 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a novel methodology that combines spectral and spatial information for supervised hyperspectral image classification is proposed. A feature reduction strategy based on independent component analysis is the main core of the spectral analysis, where the exploitation of prior information coupled to the evaluation of the reconstruction error assures the identification of the best class-informative subset of independent components. Reduced attribute profiles (APs), which are designed to address well-known issues related to information redundancy that affect the common morphological APs, are then employed for the modeling and fusion of the contextual information. Four real hyperspectral data sets, which are characterized by different spectral and spatial resolutions with a variety of scene typologies (urban, agriculture areas), have been used for assessing the accuracy and generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology. The obtained results demonstrate the classification effectiveness of the proposed approach in all different scene typologies, with respect to other state-of-the-art techniques.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2436335","research funds of the University of Iceland; research funds of the University of Trento; European Union's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) Theme Space project North State(grant numbers:606962); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7147815","Dimensionality reduction;hyperspectral images;independent component analysis (ICA);mathematical morphology (MM);reduced attribute profiles (rAPs);remote sensing (RS);supervised classification;Dimensionality reduction;hyperspectral images;independent component analysis (ICA);mathematical morphology (MM);reduced attribute profiles (rAPs);remote sensing (RS);supervised classification","Feature extraction;Hyperspectral imaging;Data mining;Matrix decomposition;Training;Spectral analysis","","86","","48","IEEE","2 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Designing and implementing automated methods that can efficiently interpret satellite images and handle their temporal nature poses a significant challenge in remote sensing. Deep learning models have proven to be able to leverage these type of data, taking into consideration both their spatial as well as temporal nature. Building on a state-of-the-art architecture using self-attention to classify crops captured in satellite images time series, we introduce two changes in order to better capture the crop phenology. Specifically, the calculation of the self-attention Query is performed by a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), while the TCN output is also taken under consideration for the final classification. Moreover, we utilize the temporal differences between consecutive time steps to create an auxiliary time series that can be employed alongside the original time series, in a two-stream architecture, that proves to be capable of further improving performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to assess the impact of these contributions. The proposed model was able to produce results that exceed the state-of-the-art on the publicly available Sentinel2-Agri dataset.","1558-2809","978-1-6654-8102-1","10.1109/IST55454.2022.9827752","European Union(grant numbers:T1EDK-01577 ARTEMIS,T2EDK-04396); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9827752","Remote sensing;Crop Classification;Deep Learning;Self-Attention;Time Series Classification","Satellites;Biological system modeling;Time series analysis;Crops;Imaging;Streaming media;Transformers","","3","","25","IEEE","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ultrawideband (UWB) positioning, an outstanding technology for high accuracy and high robustness positioning solutions, has emerged as the most promising candidate to serve this application. It has the potential to reduce the meter-level positioning accuracy of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) inside forest canopies down to the decimeter level independent of other sensors/measurements. However, to date, little is known about the actual performance of standalone UWB positioning in these environments. In this article, a detailed performance analysis of a standalone UWB positioning system in a GNSS-denied forest environment with slight and serious non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagations was performed. Positioning accuracy and the effect of the positioning update rate on the accuracy, as well as the time consumption for different positioning methods, were analyzed based on real-world datasets. The results show that the standalone UWB positioning system is able to achieve decimeter-level positioning accuracy that is better than 0.3 m in the OXY plane inside the forest canopy even in the presence of severe NLOS propagations. Therefore, this study provides a valuable reference for positioning solutions in robotics-assisted surveying for forestry automation and also in other location-based applications.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2024.3413139","Academy of Finland through the UNITE Flagship(grant numbers:337656); Capturing Structural and Functional Diversity of Trees and Tree Communities for Supporting Sustainable Use of Forests / Consortium: Diversity4Forests(grant numbers:338644); Feasibility of Inside-Canopy UAV Laser Scanning for Automated Tree Quality Surveying / Consortium: Quality4Trees(grant numbers:334002); Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Finland and European Union NextGenerationEU through the project IlmoStar(grant numbers:VN/27353/2022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10555367","Forest canopy;forestry automation;global navigation satellite system (GNSS);positioning;ultrawideband (UWB)","Forestry;Distance measurement;Accuracy;Robot sensing systems;Global navigation satellite system;Calibration;Antenna measurements","","2","","36","CCBY","12 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Time series of satellite images from the Sentinel-2 mission and weather data from the European Climate Assessment & Dataset are used to fit classifiers on historical loss data from an agricultural insurance. Two different approaches for training classifiers are explored, designing neural networks to learn directly on the time series and transforming the data to a fixed-size representation to enable the use of other methods. It is shown that in this case the second approach yields much better results, as careful feature engineering combined with more rigid methods like gradient boosting leads to less overfitting compared to the neural network approach.Compared to existing approaches, the proposed methods allow for analyzing the situation on a per-field level while using high resolution imagery (Sentinel-2) over a large geographic area.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8898926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8898926","Agriculture;Remote sensing;Machine learning","Meteorology;Time series analysis;Remote sensing;Indexes;Insurance;Satellites;Neural networks","","1","","13","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By doing so we can monitor individual pig behaviour changes over time and use these as indicators of health and well-being, which, in turn, will assist in the early detection of disease allowing for earlier and more effective intervention. However, it is a much more computationally challenging than performing this task at group level; mistakes in identification and tracking accumulate and, over time, provide noise measures. We combine a deep CNN object localisation method, Faster Region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN), with two potential real-time multi-object tracking methods in order to create a complete system that can autonomously localise and track individual pigs allowing for the extraction of metrics pertaining to individual pig behaviours from RGB cameras. We evaluate two different transfer learning strategies to adapt Faster R-CNN to our pig detection dataset that is more challenging than conventional tracking benchmark datasets. We are able to localise pigs in individual frames with 0.901 mean average precision (mAP), which then allows us to track individual pigs across video footage with 92% Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and 73.4% Identity F1-Score (IDF1), and re-identify them after occlusions and dropped frames with 0.862 mAP (0.788 Rank 1 cumulative matching characteristic (CMC)). From these tracks we extract individual behavioural metrics for total distance travelled, time spent idle, and average speed with less than 0.015 mean squared error (MSE) for each. Changes in all these behavioural metrics have value in the detection of pig health and wellbeing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933060","European Commission(grant numbers:633531); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/N031962/1,EP/M020576/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787792","Machine learning;re-identification;behaviour analysis;object detection;multi-object tracking","Measurement;Cameras;Visualization;Agriculture;Animals;Training;Deep learning","","91","","40","CCBY","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A recently promising method is approximate spectral clustering (SC) which enables spectral partitioning for large datasets to extract clusters with distinct characteristics without a parametric model. It also facilitates the use of various information types via advanced similarity criteria. However, it requires an empirical selection of a similarity criterion optimal for the corresponding application. To address this challenge, we propose an approximate SC ensemble (ASCE2) which fuses partitionings obtained by different similarity representations. Contrary to existing spectral ensembles for remote-sensing applications, the proposed ASCE2 employs neural gas quantization instead of random sampling, advanced similarity criteria instead of traditional distance-based Gaussian kernel with different decay parameters, and a two-level ensemble. We evaluate the proposed ASCE2 with three measures (accuracy, adjusted Rand index, and normalized mutual information) using five remote-sensing images, two of which are commonly available. We apply the ASCE2 in two applications for agricultural monitoring: 1) land-cover identification to determine orchard fields using a WorldView-2 image (0.5-m spatial resolution) and 2) finding lands in good agricultural condition using multitemporal RapidEye images (5-m spatial resolution). Experimental results indicate a significant betterment of the resulting partitionings obtained by the proposed ensemble, with respect to the evaluation measures in these applications.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2424292","TUBITAK(grant numbers:112E195); EU FP7 Marie Curie Career Integration(grant numbers:IAM4MARS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7103289","Approximate spectral clustering (SC);cluster ensemble;clustering;geodesic similarity;land-cover identification;Approximate spectral clustering (SC);cluster ensemble;clustering;geodesic similarity;land-cover identification","Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Quantization (signal);Topology;Image color analysis;Soil;Accuracy","","15","","42","IEEE","7 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes the development of a smart pest monitoring system, developed in accordance with specific requirements associated with the agricultural sector. The proposed system is a low-cost smart insect trap, for use in orchards, that detects specific insect species that are detrimental to fruit quality.
