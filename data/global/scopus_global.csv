However, global warming, characterized by elevated temperatures, water shortage, and increased drought stress, has significantly impacted GPP. Various GPP products based on different algorithms and input data have been developed, but their performance under extreme climatic conditions remains unverified. This study evaluated the consistency and accuracy of eight global GPP products from 2003 to 2014 using flux towers data. The results show that GPP products performed well under overall conditions, with an average correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.604, and Penman-Monteith-Leuning-version-2 (PMLv2) showed the best performance (R2 = 0.664). However, under extreme climatic conditions like high temperature, high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and drought, the accuracy significantly dropped (R2 = 0.3), with Global-dataset-of-solar-induced-chlorophyll-fluorescence (GOSIF) being the most affected. Accuracy was lower in croplands (CRO) and grasslands (GRA). To enhance accuracy under extreme climatic conditions, GPP products were used as inputs to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on ECMWF-Reanalysis-5th-Generation (ERA5) meteorological data and compared with random forests (RF). Four GPP products significantly contributed to the model, with a cumulative contribution of 80.3 %. Under extreme climatic conditions, CNN significantly improved the estimation accuracy of GPP and outperformed RF. The optimal values for R2 and the root mean square error (RMSE) were 0.905 (increase by at least 201.7 %) and 7.708 gC m−2 8d−1 (decrease by at least 50.7 %). The model also performed well at 20 independent validation sites (R2 = 0.783). This study offers a method to improve GPP estimation under extreme climatic conditions, unrestricted by time and space. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Network; Extreme Climatic Conditions; Gpp Products; Gross Primary Productivity; Uncertainty; Carbon; Climatic Conditions; Convolutional Neural Network; Ecological Process; Extreme Climatic Condition; Gross Primary Productivity; Gross Primary Productivity Product; Performance; Random Forests; Uncertainty; Convolutional Neural Networks; Agricultural Land; Algorithm; Climate Conditions; Extreme Event; Grassland; Machine Learning; Plant; Primary Production; Uncertainty Analysis; Accuracy; Article; Climate Change; Convolutional Neural Network; Cropland; Deep Learning; Deep Neural Network; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Global Change; Gross Primary Productivity; High Temperature; Human; Meteorology; Productivity; Random Forest; Uncertainty; Validation Process; Vapor Pressure; Article; Chlorophyll Fluorescence; Climate; Controlled Study; Correlation Coefficient; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Drought Stress; Greenhouse Effect; Nonhuman; Photosynthesis; Root Mean Squared Error; Temperature; Water; Carbon","Climatic conditions; Convolutional neural network; Ecological process; Extreme climatic condition; Gross primary productivity; Gross primary productivity product; Performance; Random forests; Uncertainty; Convolutional neural networks; agricultural land; algorithm; climate conditions; extreme event; grassland; machine learning; plant; primary production; uncertainty analysis; accuracy; Article; climate change; convolutional neural network; cropland; deep learning; deep neural network; drought; evapotranspiration; global change; gross primary productivity; high temperature; human; meteorology; productivity; random forest; uncertainty; validation process; vapor pressure; article; chlorophyll fluorescence; climate; controlled study; correlation coefficient; diagnostic test accuracy study; drought stress; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; photosynthesis; root mean squared error; temperature; water; carbon","","carbon, 7440-44-0","This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFD1900404-01, 2023YFD1900702-01), the Key Research and Development of Jiangxi Province in China (20212BDH80016), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51979232, 52179044).","Ahlström, Anders, The dominant role of semi-arid ecosystems in the trend and variability of the land CO2 sink, Science, 348, 6237, pp. 895-899, (2015); Alexander, L.

Water supply is indispensable for household usage incl sanitation, livestock survival, farming of agricultural crops and small-scale hydropower generation. In mountain environments seasonal as well as multi-annual buffering and storage are limited, surface runoff into streams is the main source of water. The WaterFlow project has been designed to enable academic partners in the Kyrgyz Republic to perform hydrographic analysis of small mountain watersheds to explore current and future potentials for local communities. One key objective is the quantification of the impact of regional climate change scenarios on streamflow as a basis for assessment of future village-level livability and potential mitigation efforts. Hydrologic surface runoff estimation and simulation is a data-intensive process requiring detailed topographic, landcover / landuse and climate change scenario data for distributed modeling. While access to national level or regional data frequently poses a major obstacle to large scale local research. The current and increasing availability of high-resolution global data sets facilitates analyses essentially anywhere on the planet. This paper serves as a case study and process documentation how the ‘Living Atlas’ as a platform consolidating a rich and continuously updated collection of worldwide openly accessible data supports, inter alia, the foundation data for distributed modeling of surface runoff essentially anywhere on the planet. This research does not aim at achieving results specifically valid for the sample study areas, the latter rather serve as demonstrators for analyses based on cloud-based data services. Steps beyond data preparation, including local observations and integration of climate and land cover change scenarios are briefly mentioned to contextualize the data preparation and pre-processing steps presented below. Altogether, the WaterFlow initiative aims at supporting the development of science-based local capacity for environmental monitoring, within the explicit context of appreciating the potential impacts of likely climate changes on the local water balance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Citizen Science; Geoportals; Hydrological Modelling; Open Data; Watersheds; Climate Change; Hydrological Modeling; Land Cover; Land Use; Mountain Environment; Runoff; Water Supply; Watershed; Kyrgyzstan","climate change; hydrological modeling; land cover; land use; mountain environment; runoff; water supply; watershed; Kyrgyzstan","","","The WaterFlow project is supported through the Austrian \u2018Kooperation Entwicklungsforschung\u2019 (KoEF) program with funding provided by the Federal Ministry for Education, Science and Research (BMBWF) and managed by the Austrian Agency for Education and Internationalization (OeAD).

This is likely to worsen food insecurity in some countries, calling for efforts to close the yield gap as much as possible. Estimating the yield gap and its drivers is essential for devising strategies to increase yields. This study quantifies the wheat yield gap in Morocco's five major wheat production regions. It analyzes the historical sensitivity of wheat yield to temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture, which are important factors affecting agricultural productivity. Furthermore, it evaluates how these yield gaps impact the revenue of producers in these regions. This analysis was conducted using datasets, including the Global Dataset of Historical Yield (GDHY) for yield gap assessment, soil moisture data, ERA5 reanalysis data, and CHIRPS datasets for climate assessment from 1982 to 2016. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were employed to reflect the variation characteristics of wheat yield and to identify the impacts of precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture on wheat yield. Results: High regional differences in wheat yield gaps were observed, with values ranging from 1.64 t/ha in Casablanca Settat to 4.12 t/ha in Marrakech Safi, and temporal variability ranging from 9 to 18%. Wheat yields were found to be strongly correlated with rainfall, particularly from December to March. Temperature fluctuations had a significant negative impact on wheat yield across the regions. Soil moisture was positively correlated with wheat yields throughout all growing periods, showing the strongest impacts during the early vegetative development phase. Additionally, losses due to wheat yield gaps were considerable, ranging between $ 194 and 891 per hectare. The revenue loss due to Yield Gap I ranged from 49 to 71%, while the loss due to Yield Gap II ranged from 240 to 444%, depending on the method used to calculate the wheat yield gap. Conclusions: Results reveal gaps in wheat yield, forming a basis for process-based modeling to understand crop yield gap drivers. Understanding yield gap drivers will play a pivotal role in evidence-based intervention strategies to enhance yields. By applying such strategies, it is possible to not only manage and reduce the variability in wheat production, but also ensure sustainable agricultural practices and achieve food security in Morocco and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate; Food Security; Morocco; Sustainable Development Goals; Wheat; Yield Gap","","","","This study was conducted in the Framework of the PAMOCPP-APRA project grant number 14DPRA01, funded by the OCP Foundation.","Acevedo, Maricelis A., The role of wheat in global food security, pp. 81-110, (2018); Achli, Soumia, Vulnerability of Barley, Maize, and Wheat Yields to Variations in Growing Season Precipitation in Morocco, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 7, (2022); Adiele, Joy Geraldine, Towards closing cassava yield gap in West Africa: Agronomic efficiency and storage root yield responses to NPK fertilizers, Field Crops Research, 253, (2020); World Agriculture Towards 2030 2050 the 2012 Revision, (2012); Agrometeorological Cereal Yield Forecasting in Morocco, (2013); Balaghi, Riad, Empirical regression models using NDVI, rainfall and temperature data for the early prediction of wheat grain yields in Morocco, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 10, 4, pp. 438-452, (2008); Partie I Strategie De Developpement Agricole Durable, (2002); Ben Hassen, Tarek, Impacts of the Russia-Ukraine War on Global Food Security: Towards More Sustainable and Resilient Food Systems?, Foods, 11, 15, (2022); Beza, Eskender, Review of yield gap explaining factors and opportunities for alternative data collection approaches, European Journal of Agronomy, 82, pp. 206-222, (2017); Political Economy of the Wheat Sector in Morocco Seed Systems Varietal Adoption and Impacts, (2019)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","20487010","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214098864"

However, there remains a knowledge gap regarding the role of different crop types in maintaining biodiversity within the agricultural landscape. By extracting biodiversity data from global datasets and classifying different crop types, we quantified the contribution of different crop types to biodiversity. Our results indicate that biodiversity levels vary widely among crop types. We found a general loss of biodiversity when natural vegetation is converted to agricultural land, and highest losses in fiber crops, cereals and oil crops, and least in other crops (such as coffee or cocoa) and in mixed crops. In general, perennial crops retain more biodiversity than annual crops. Losses of biodiversity can be mitigated through mixed cropping of multiple crop types, especially by combining annual and perennial crops. The negative impact of converting natural vegetation to agriculture is greater in tropical than in nontropical areas, and hence, the import of commodities from these biodiversity-rich regions may be particularly detrimental. Given the ongoing increase in biodiversity losses from global intensification and expansion of agricultural land, maintaining or restoring natural vegetation, rating the crop-type-specific biodiversity, diversifying crops, and preferring perennial over annual crops, particularly in the tropics, need to be better considered and implemented in global agri-environmental schemes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agri-environmental Schemes; Biodiversity; Crop Diversification; Land Use; Natural Habitat; Perennial And Annual Crops; Agricultural Land; Biodiversity; Crop Production; Data Set; Knowledge Based System; Vegetation Dynamics; Agriculture; Crop; Environmental Protection; Growth, Development And Aging; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural","agricultural land; biodiversity; crop production; data set; knowledge based system; vegetation dynamics; agriculture; crop; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural","","","Funding text 1: We are grateful to the National Key R&D Program of China (no.: 2023YFD1902700) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (U24A20412) for the research founding.

The new framework reported in this manuscript is based on kernel-induced distance matric using the Gaussian Radial Basis Function (GRBF), and the proposed algorithm is named as Distributed Kernel-based Weighted Fuzzy C-Means (DKWFCM) algorithm. In wireless sensor networks (WSN), Distributed approaches perform the clustering task across network nodes, mitigating privacy risks, reducing communication overhead, and adapting to network dynamics. Feature-weight and cluster-weight learning are incorporated for more effective cluster analysis in distributed environments. Additionally, DKWFCM leverages diffusion-based learning to enable information processing across multiple wireless sensor nodes. The proposed algorithm DKWFCM performance is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets distributed over six wireless sensor nodes. Five datasets for validation which consists of two Synthetic datasets (Circle_3_2, Mixed_3_2) and three real-world datasets (the Cook Agricultural land dataset, Thames River water quality dataset, and Canada Weather station dataset). Performance is assessed using the Silhouette Index (SI) and Dunn Index (DI) as a validation measures. Simulation results demonstrated the superior performance of DKWFCM over traditional FCM algorithms such as Distributed FCM (DFCM) algorithm and Distributed Weighted FCM (DWFCM). The superiority is evident in various aspects, such as visual clusters obtained at each node, SI value, DI value plots at the sensor nodes, and average convergence plots. The minimum value of average Euclidean deviation of proposed DKWFCM optimization algorithm is reduced by 27.73%; 31.86% and 10.11%; 19.40% compared to DFCM and DWFCM respectively for both synthetic datasets.

We analyze how these features influence crop yields by utilizing remotely sensed data. Our methodology incorporates clustering algorithms and correlation matrix analysis to identify significant patterns and dependencies, offering a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting agricultural productivity in Senegal. To optimize the model's performance and identify the optimal hyperparameters, we implemented a comprehensive grid search across four distinct machine learning regressors: Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM). Each regressor offers unique functionalities, enhancing our exploration of potential model configurations. The top-performing models were selected based on evaluating multiple performance metrics, ensuring robust and accurate predictive capabilities. The results demonstrated that XGBoost and CatBoost perform better than the other two. We introduce synthetic crop data generated using a Variational Auto Encoder to address the challenges posed by limited agricultural datasets. By achieving high similarity scores with real-world data, our synthetic samples enhance model robustness, mitigate overfitting, and provide a viable solution for small dataset issues in agriculture. Our approach distinguishes itself by creating a flexible model applicable to various crops together. By integrating five crop datasets and generating high-quality synthetic data, we improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and enhance realism. Our findings provide crucial insights for productivity drivers in key cropping systems, enabling robust recommendations and strengthening the decision-making capabilities of policymakers and farmers in data-scarce regions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crop Yield Prediction; Ensemble Learning; Pattern Recognition On Spatiotemporal And Physiographical Variables; Synthetic Tabular Data Generation; Variational Auto Encoder; Contrastive Learning; Auto Encoders; Crop Yield; Crop Yield Prediction; Data Generation; Ensemble Learning; Pattern Recognition On Spatiotemporal And Physiographical Variable; Synthetic Tabular Data Generation; Tabular Data; Variational Auto Encoder; Yield Prediction; Adversarial Machine Learning","Contrastive Learning; Auto encoders; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Data generation; Ensemble learning; Pattern recognition on spatiotemporal and physiographical variable; Synthetic tabular data generation; Tabular data; Variational auto encoder; Yield prediction; Adversarial machine learning","","","This study was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Resilience and Food Security/Center for Agriculture-led Growth under the Cooperative Agreement #AID-OAA-L-14-00006 as part of Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Sustainable Intensification (SIIL).

There is a body of literature linking increasingly intense, large fires to a build-up of fuel from rural land abandonment exacerbated by climate change. However, a better understanding of the complex factors driving fires in fire-prone landscapes is needed. We use a global database based on the MODIS Fire CCI51 product, and the Greater Côa Valley, a 340,000-ha area in Portugal, as a case study, to investigate the environmental drivers of fire and potential tools for managing fires in a landscape that has undergone changing agricultural and grazing management. Results: Between 2001 and 2020, fires burned 32% (1881.45 km2) of the study area. Scrublands proportionally burnt the most, but agricultural land and forests were also greatly impacted. The risk of large fires (> 1 km2) was highest in these land cover types under dry conditions in late summer. Areas with higher sheep densities were more likely to burn, while cattle density had no apparent relationship with fire occurrence. There was also a 15% lower probability of a fire occurring in protected areas. Conclusion: Future climatic changes that increase drought conditions will likely elevate the risk of large fires in the Mediterranean basin, and abandoned farmland undergoing natural succession towards scrubland will be at particularly high risk. Our results indicate that livestock grazing does not provide a simple solution to reducing fire risk, but that a more holistic management approach addressing social causes and nature-based solutions could be effective in reducing fire occurrence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drought; Fire Drivers; Livestock Grazing; Portugal; Protected Area; Remote-sensing; Agricultural Management; Climate Change; Drought; Fire Management; Grazing Management; Livestock Farming; Modis; Protected Area; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Portugal","agricultural management; climate change; drought; fire management; grazing management; livestock farming; MODIS; protected area; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Portugal","","","","Abatzoglou, John T., TerraClimate, a high-resolution global dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance from 1958-2015, Scientific Data, 5, (2018); Andrade, Cristina Maria, Multi-Indices Diagnosis of the Conditions That Led to the Two 2017 Major Wildfires in Portugal, Fire, 6, 2, (2023); Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike, (1974); Arellano-Del-Verbo, Gonzalo, Large-Fire Ignitions Are Higher in Protected Areas than Outside Them in West-Central Spain, Fire, 6, 1, (2023); Arévalo, José Ramón, Wildfire impact and the “fire paradox” in a natural and endemic pine forest stand and shrubland, Fire, 1, 3, pp. 1-7, (2018); Bashan, Danielle, Regeneration dynamics of woody vegetation in a Mediterranean landscape under different disturbance-based management treatments, Applied Vegetation Science, 20, 1, pp. 106-114, (2017); Bond, William J., Fire as a global 'herbivore': The ecology and evolution of flammable ecosystems, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 20, 7, pp. 387-394, (2005); Calleja, Juan A., Cattle Grazing Fails to Control Shrub Encroachment in Mediterranean Landscapes, Rangeland Ecology and Management, 72, 5, pp. 803-811, (2019); Casals, Pere, Composition and structure of Mediterranean shrublands for fuel characterization, Annals of Forest Science, 80, 1, (2023); Meira Castro, Ana C., Mapping the causes of forest fires in Portugal by clustering analysis, Geosciences (Switzerland), 10, 2, (2020)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","19339747","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205448565"

M., AgResearch Invermay, Dunedin, New Zealand","CONTEXT: Global agroecosystems, predominantly pastoral and rangelands, are crucial for food, fibre, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity, covering about 40-50 % of Earth's land. Yet, they are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion, and land degradation. In New Zealand, nearly half the land supports grazing ruminants, significantly impacting the environment and contributing to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Accurate livestock population data are essential to understand and mitigate these impacts. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to create a high-resolution, farm-scale dataset of livestock densities in New Zealand, using a novel methodological framework that integrates agricultural production surveys, geospatial products and data derived from remote sensing. This framework is designed to improve the accuracy of environmental assessments, inform national and global livestock inventories, and guide sustainable land-use and conservation efforts. METHODS: The study used a combination of geodatabases, data derived from remote sensing, regional statistics, and surveys to generate high-resolution gridded data products of livestock densities. Livestock counts were refined using land cover and farm-type data to exclude non-pastoral lands and accurately estimate grazing densities. The approach integrated data cleaning, processing, and spatial analysis within Python and qGIS, providing time-series analyses and regional validations against standard survey data to ensure accuracy and reliability. The outputs were further compared with global-scale livestock data to validate the accuracy and bias in global data being used to inform international modeling efforts. RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS: We generated detailed maps showing spatial and temporal trends of sheep, beef, and dairy cattle across New Zealand. This high-resolution national dataset provides a more accurate national data source than previous global estimates for New Zealand and identifies biases/overestimations in global livestock data. The study also offers insights into the environmental pressures of livestock grazing, particularly regarding greenhouse gas emissions and soil erosion. The research presents a significant advance in our ability to quantify livestock populations at farm scale across national extents, providing a basis for more precise environmental and policy-making decisions. It underscores the need for high-resolution, locally validated data to inform global databases and supports targeted interventions to mitigate environmental impacts. SIGNIFICANCE: The study's findings are crucial for managing agroecosystems sustainably, enhancing greenhouse gas inventories, and improving land and water quality management. They represent a step forward in our ability to quantify and manage the ecological footprint of livestock farming, with implications for policy and land management both nationally in New Zealand and potentially globally. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Planning; Greenhouse Gas; Livestock Distribution; Population Modeling; Soil Degradation; Conservation Planning; Environmental Impact Assessment; Environmental Planning; Greenhouse Gas; Land Management; Livestock Farming; Pastoralism; Population Density; Rangeland; Remote Sensing; Soil Degradation; Spatial Distribution; Spatial Resolution; New Zealand","conservation planning; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; greenhouse gas; land management; livestock farming; pastoralism; population density; rangeland; remote sensing; soil degradation; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; New Zealand","","","Financial support was provided by the New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre from within the New Zealand Minstry for Primary Industries (MPI) by grant number C0034844.","Abdalla, Mohamed, Critical review of the impacts of grazing intensity on soil organic carbon storage and other soil quality indicators in extensively managed grasslands, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 253, pp. 62-81, (2018); Landcare Research Contract Report Lc0708 081 for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, (2008); undefined, (2016); Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research New Zealand, (2019); Borrelli, Pasquale, Effect of Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions on erosion and soil organic carbon balance: A national case study, Land Use Policy, 50, pp. 408-421, (2016); Butt, Bilal Ayaz, Pastoral resource access and utilization: Quantifying the spatial and temporal relationships between livestock mobility, density and biomass availability in southern Kenya, Land Degradation and Development, 21, 6, pp. 520-539, (2010); Survey Quarterly, (2011); Nzga Research and Practice Series, (2021); Dominati, Estelle J., Farming in a changing environment: Increasing biodiversity on farm for the supply of multiple ecosystem services, Science of the Total Environment, 662, pp. 703-713, (2019); Dominati, Estelle J., A framework for classifying and quantifying the natural capital and ecosystem services of soils, Ecological Economics, 69, 9, pp. 1858-1868, (2010)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","0308521X","","AGSYD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204546183"

Cropland area trends show a 204.24% increase from 1069 to 1590, a 27.22% decrease from 1590 to 1630, a 74.09% increase from 1630 to 1940, and an 8.23% decrease from 1940 to 2000. Cropland coverage in North and South Korea increased from 1069 to 1940, then diverged, with a decrease in the South and an increase in the North until 2000. Southern and western provinces, with better agricultural conditions, had the highest cropland coverage, exceeding 20%. Social factors like dynastic changes, wars, agricultural policies, and urbanization influenced these changes. Our analysis suggests that the HYDE dataset significantly underestimates cropland on the peninsula, and regional studies could improve global dataset accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cropland Coverage; Historical Records; Korean Peninsula; Land-cover Changes","","","","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42307562) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China on Global Change (No. 2017YFA0603304).","Economic History of Korea, (1988); Cao, Bowen, A 1km global cropland dataset from 10000BCE to 2100CE, Earth System Science Data, 13, 11, pp. 5403-5421, (2021); Chini, Louise Parsons, Land-use harmonization datasets for annual global carbon budgets, Earth System Science Data, 13, 8, pp. 4175-4189, (2021); Cousins, Sara A.O., Reconstructing past land use and vegetation patterns using palaeogeographical and archaeological data: A focus on grasslands in Nynäs by the Baltic Sea in south-eastern Sweden, Landscape and Urban Planning, 61, 1, pp. 1-18, (2002); Dias, Lívia Cristina Pinto, Patterns of land use, extensification, and intensification of Brazilian agriculture, Global Change Biology, 22, 8, pp. 2887-2903, (2016); J Nat Resour, (2019); Ellis, Erle Christopher, People have shaped most of terrestrial nature for at least 12,000 years, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 17, (2021); Fang, Xiuqi, Methodology for credibility assessment of historical global LUCC datasets, Science China Earth Sciences, 63, 7, pp. 1013-1025, (2020); Fluet-Chouinard, Etienne, Extensive global wetland loss over the past three centuries, Nature, 614, 7947, pp. 281-286, (2023); Foley, Jonathan A., Global consequences of land use, Science, 309, 5734, pp. 570-574, (2005)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","1436378X; 14363798","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204426578"

These products have been utilised extensively in weather and climate modelling, hydrology, and agricultural research. However, it’s important to note that the accuracy of these satellite products can vary spatially and across different datasets. Three satellite and one reanalysis gridded rainfall products CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data Version 2), TRMM (TRMM 3B43: Monthly Precipitation Estimates), TerraClimate (High-resolution global dataset of monthly climate University of Idaho), and ERA-5 (Land monthly Averaged-ECMWF Climate Reanalysis Version 5) were analysed using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and evaluated with station-based observed rainfall data to determine the representative dataset for trend analysis in different agroclimatic zones in Arunachal Pradesh, Northeast India. The trend analysis was conducted based on 20-year long-term precipitation data at an annual and seasonal scale in different agroclimatic regions of Arunachal Pradesh, India. The global performance index (GPI) ranking identified CHIRPS as the most suitable alternative data for station-observed data records. It was then used for the spatial trend analysis of different agroclimatic zones on an annual and seasonal scale at the pixel level in GEE. Several approaches were used to identify trends, including the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test, Sen’s slope estimator, and Z statistics. The patterns derived from grid-based data were compared to observed precipitation data. Seasonally, a significant declining trend was noted for the alpine zone (AZ) and the Temperate sub-alpine zone (TSAZ). Mid-tropical hill zone (MTHZ) and Sub-tropical hill region (STHR) reported a minor decline trend. Overall, in all Arunachal Pradesh agroclimatic zones, the findings indicated a general decreasing trend on an annual and seasonal scale. Observed and satellite rainfall gridded data trend analysis revealed the same pattern with different magnitudes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chirps; Climate Change; Era-5; Gee; Mann-kendall Test; Terraclimate; Trend Analysis; Trmm","","","","","Abatzoglou, John T., TerraClimate, a high-resolution global dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance from 1958-2015, Scientific Data, 5, (2018); Ahmad, Ijaz, Spatiotemporal analysis of precipitation variability in annual, seasonal and extreme values over upper Indus River basin, Atmospheric Research, 213, pp. 346-360, (2018); Abdul-Aziz, Omar I., Trends and variability in the hydrological regime of the Mackenzie River Basin, Journal of Hydrology, 319, 1-4, pp. 282-294, (2006); Banerjee, Abhishek, An analysis of long-term rainfall trends and variability in the uttarakhand himalaya using google earth engine, Remote Sensing, 12, 4, (2020); Bangsawan, Laode, Improved Performance of the CHIRPS Monthly Rainfall Estimation Extraction from Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in South Sulawesi Region, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 893, 1, (2021); Divya, P.

Prices are driven by aggregate supply rather than what happens in individual countries in isolation. Estimating the effects of weather-induced shocks on production, trade patterns and prices hence requires a globally representative weather data set. Recently, two data sets that provide daily or hourly records, GMFD and ERA5-Land, became available. Starting with the US, a data rich region, we formally test whether these global data sets are as good as more fine-scaled country-specific data in explaining yields and whether they estimate similar response functions. While GMFD and ERA5-Land have lower predictive skill for US corn and soybeans yields than the fine-scaled PRISM data, they still correctly uncover the underlying non-linear temperature relationship. All specifications using daily temperature extremes under any of the weather data sets outperform models that use a quadratic in average temperature. Correctly capturing the effect of daily extremes has a larger effect than the choice of weather data. In a second step, focusing on Sub Saharan Africa, a data sparse region, we confirm that GMFD and ERA5-Land have superior predictive power to CRU, a global weather data set previously employed for modeling climate effects in the region. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Production; Commodity Market; Crop Yield; Data Set; Maize; Meteorological Hazard; Soybean; Temperature Gradient; Weather; Africa South Of The Sahara; Article; Climate Change; Critical Temperature; Cropland; Environmental Temperature; Evolutionary Adaptation; Extreme Hot Weather; Extreme Weather; Global Climate; Growing Season; Harvest; High Temperature; Irrigation (agriculture); Meteorology; Precipitation; Temperature Sensitivity; United States; Vegetation; Article; Controlled Study; Human; Temperature; Africa","agricultural production; commodity market; crop yield; data set; maize; meteorological hazard; soybean; temperature gradient; weather; Africa south of the Sahara; Article; climate change; critical temperature; cropland; environmental temperature; evolutionary adaptation; extreme hot weather; extreme weather; global climate; growing season; harvest; high temperature; irrigation (agriculture); meteorology; precipitation; temperature sensitivity; United States; vegetation; article; controlled study; human; temperature; Africa","","","This work was supported by USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Grant No. 2022-67023-36400 (D.H. and W.S.) as well as by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research Program, Earth and Environmental Systems Modeling, MultiSector Dynamics, Contract No. DE-SC0016162 (D.H. and W.S.).","Schlenker, Wolfram, Nonlinear temperature effects indicate severe damages to U.S. crop yields under climate change, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 106, 37, pp. 15594-15598, (2009); Welch, Jarrod R., Rice yields in tropical/subtropical Asia exhibit large but opposing sensitivities to minimum and maximum temperatures, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 107, 33, pp. 14562-14567, (2010); Butler, Ethan E., Adaptation of US maize to temperature variations, Nature Climate Change, 3, 1, pp. 68-72, (2013); Burke, Marshall B., Adaptation to climate change: Evidence from US agriculture, American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 8, 3, pp. 106-140, (2016); Tack, Jesse B., Effect of warming temperatures on US wheat yields, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 112, 22, pp. 6931-6936, (2015); D'Agostino, Anthony Louis, Recent weather fluctuations and agricultural yields: implications for climate change, Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom), 47, pp. 159-171, (2016); Auffhammer, Maximilian, Using weather data and climate model output in economic analyses of climate change, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, 7, 2, pp. 181-198, (2013); Lobell, David B., Climate trends and global crop production since 1980, Science, 333, 6042, pp. 616-620, (2011); Research Data Archive, (2006); Muñoz-Sabater, Joaquín, ERA5-Land: A state-of-the-art global reanalysis dataset for land applications, Earth System Science Data, 13, 9, pp. 4349-4383, (2021)","","Nature Research","","","","","","20411723","","","38821938","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195011070"

Despite unfavorable weather circumstances, this project's major objective is to boost production. As a consequence of technological advancements in agriculture, precision farming as a way for enhancing crop yields is gaining appeal and becoming more prevalent. When it comes to predicting future data, machine learning employs a number of methods, including the creation of models and the acquisition of prediction rules based on past data. In this manuscript, we examine various techniques to machine learning, as well as an automated agricultural yield projection model based on selecting the most relevant features. For the purpose of selecting features, the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix method is utilised. For classification, we make use of the AdaBoost Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithms. The data set that was used in this study is simply a compilation of information about a variety of topics, including yield, pesticide use, rainfall, and average temperature. This data collection consists of 33 characteristics or qualities in total. The crops soya beans, maze, potato, rice, paddy, wheat, and sorghum are included in this data collection. This data collection was made possible through the collaboration of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Data Bank, both of which make their data available to the public. The AdaBoost decision tree has achieved the highest level of accuracy possible when used to anticipate agricultural yield. Both the accuracy rate and the recall rate are quite high at 99 percent. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accuracy; Adaboost Decision Tree; Boosting, Crop Yield Prediction; Feature Selection; Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix; Accuracy Assessment; Algorithm; Artificial Neural Network; Climate Effect; Crop Yield; Developing World; Efficiency Measurement; Food And Agricultural Organization; Machine Learning; Maize; Nearest Neighbor Analysis; Pesticide Application; Potato; Precision Agriculture; Rainfall; Resource Availability; Rice; Sorghum; Soybean; Temperature Profile; Wheat","accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial neural network; climate effect; crop yield; developing world; efficiency measurement; Food and Agricultural Organization; machine learning; maize; nearest neighbor analysis; pesticide application; potato; precision agriculture; rainfall; resource availability; rice; sorghum; soybean; temperature profile; wheat","","","","Bhanu, K.

Hg and As present an extremely and a moderately contaminated level, respectively. The human health risks posed by As, Hg, and Ni merit more attention. Pokeweed may be considered as a potential Hg hyperaccumulator. Soil pollution caused by potentially toxic metal(loid)s (PTMs) near mercury (Hg) mines has attracted extensive attention, yet the status and potential health risks of PTM contamination in soils near Hg mining sites have rarely been investigated on a large scale. Global data on methylmercury (MeHg), Hg, Cd, Cr, As, Pb, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Ni concentrations in soils from Hg mining areas were obtained from published research articles (1999–2023). Based on the database, pollution levels, spatial distributions, and potential health risks were investigated. Results indicated that the average percentage of MeHg to total Hg in agricultural soils (0.19%) was significantly higher than that in non-agricultural soils (0.013%). Indeed, 72.4% of these study sites were extremely contaminated with Hg. Approximately 45% of the examined sites displayed a moderate level of As contamination or even more. Meanwhile, the examined sites in Spain and Turkey exhibited considerably higher pollution levels of Hg and As than other regions. The mean hazard indices of the nine PTMs were 2.91 and 0.59 for children and adults, with 85.6% and 13.3% of non-carcinogenic risks for children and adults that exceeded the safe level of 1, respectively. In addition, 70.2% and 56.7% of the total cancer risks through exposure to five carcinogenic PTMs in children and adults, respectively, exceeded the safety level. As and Hg showed a high exceedance of non-carcinogenic risks, while As and Ni were the leading contributors to carcinogenic risks.

The data are collected with passive samplers and archived as monthly averages; quality assurance is maintained by INDAAF's calibration and intercomparison protocols with other programmes employing the same systems. This analysis reports on correlations of INDAAF ozone time series (1995-2020) with local meteorological parameters and with ozone precursors, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), derived from standard global databases. Mean annual averages of surface ozone range from 3.9 ± 1.1 ppb (Bomassa) to 30.8 ± 8.0 ppb (Louis Trichardt), reflecting a general positive gradient from west central Africa to South Africa. At the decade scale, from 2000 to 2020, the Katibougou and Banizoumbou sites (dry savanna) experienced a significant decrease in ozone of around -2.4 and -0.8 ppb per decade, respectively. These decreasing trends are consistent with those observed for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and BVOCs. An increasing trend is observed in Zoétélé (2001-2020), estimated at +0.7 ppb per decade, and at Skukuza (2000-2015; +3.4 ppb per decade). The increasing trends are consistent with increasing biogenic emissions at Zoétélé and NO2 levels at Skukuza. Very few surface O3 measurements exist in Africa, and the long-term results presented in this study are the most extensive for the ecosystems studied. The importance of maintaining long-term observations like INDAAF cannot be overstated. The data can be used to assess ozone impacts on African crops. For the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report Phase II (TOAR II), they provide invaluable constraints for models of chemical and climate processes in the atmosphere. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric Chemistry; Biogenic Emission; Nitrogen Oxides; Ozone; Trend Analysis; Volatile Organic Compound; South Africa","atmospheric chemistry; biogenic emission; nitrogen oxides; ozone; trend analysis; volatile organic compound; South Africa","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the INDAAF project (International Network to study Deposition and Atmospheric chemistry in AFrica) and especially all its local technicians for their maintenance and sampling work.

Soil extracellular enzymes play an important role in the transformation of elements and compounds in soil, particularly acid (ACP) and alkaline (ALP) phosphatases (both, APases). These enzymes have a vital role in releasing phosphorus (P) from organic matter. However, the effect of climate variables and agro-ecosystem management on APase activity in croplands remains unclear, as does its eventual relationship with agricultural productivity. Therefore, we compiled a global database of APase activity in croplands (between 1977 and 2022) and we analysed 5876 observations across 474 papers to study climate variables, crop family, and management effects on ACP and ALP activity, and their relationship with yield. ACP activity is reduced by higher temperatures (p<0.001) and lower rainfall (p=0.002). There was an interaction effect of temperature and precipitation on ALP activity (p=0.046), with the negative effect of temperature being stronger with high precipitation, and low precipitation showing low ALP activity levels at any temperature. The crop family greatly influenced APase activity (p<0.001). Management practices affected ACP and ALP activity differently; ACP activity was positively influenced by organic fertilization combined with, crop rotation or irrigation by an average of 15.6 % and 30.7 %, respectively. ALP activity was mainly positively influenced by the interaction of two different factors: organic or inorganic-organic fertilization and reduced or zero tillage. Further understanding of soil enzyme mechanisms would aid global food security and yield. As ACP activity doubles from 100.0 to 200.0 mg pNP kg−1h−1, the crop yield increases by more than two-fold, an outcome not demonstrated in croplands until now. These results could enhance yield potential through the promotion of APase activity, and the consideration of climate variables and agro-ecosystem management, which could ultimately improve cost-benefit ratios for sustainable crop growth. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arable Land; Climate; Management; Phosphomonoesterases; Species; Yield; Agricultural Land; Arable Land; Climate Effect; Crop Yield; Database; Enzyme Activity; Fertilizer Application; Global Perspective; Management Practice","agricultural land; arable land; climate effect; crop yield; database; enzyme activity; fertilizer application; global perspective; management practice","","","Giovanni Peratoner at Laimburg Research Center (Italy) for help in the statistical understanding of field responses of APase activity.

A 10-class land cover mapping scheme was established, reflecting East China’s diverse landscape characteristics and incorporating a new category for plastic greenhouses. Plastic greenhouses are key to understanding surface heterogeneity in agricultural regions, as they can significantly impact local climate conditions, such as heat flux and evapotranspiration, yet they are often not represented in conventional land cover classifications. This is mainly due to the lack of high-resolution datasets capable of detecting these small yet impactful features. For the six-province study area, we selected and processed Landsat 8 imagery from 2015–2018, filtering for cloud cover. Complementary datasets, such as digital elevation models (DEM) and nighttime lighting data, were integrated to enrich the inputs for the Random Forest classification. A comprehensive training dataset was compiled to support Random Forest training and classification accuracy. We developed an automated workflow to manage the data processing, including satellite image selection, preprocessing, classification, and image mosaicking, thereby ensuring the system’s practicality and facilitating future updates. We included three Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model experiments in this study to highlight the impact of our land cover maps on daytime and nighttime temperature predictions. The resulting regional land cover dataset achieved an overall accuracy of 83.2% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.81. These accuracy statistics are higher than existing national and global datasets. The model results suggest that the newly developed land cover, combined with a mosaic option in the Unified Noah scheme in WRF, provided the best overall performance for both daytime and nighttime temperature predictions. In addition to supporting the WRF model, our land cover map products, with a planned 3–5-year update schedule, could serve as a valuable data source for ecological assessments in the East China region, informing environmental policy and promoting sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accuracy Assessment; East China; Land Cover Mapping; Plastic Greenhouses; Random Forest; Decision Trees; Landsat; Mapping; Sustainable Development; Accuracy Assessment; East China; Land Cover Datasets; Land Cover Mapping; Land Cover Maps; Nighttime Temperatures; Performance; Plastic Greenhouse; Random Forests; Weather Research And Forecasting Models","Decision trees; Landsat; Mapping; Sustainable development; Accuracy assessment; East China; Land cover datasets; Land cover mapping; Land cover maps; Nighttime temperatures; Performance; Plastic greenhouse; Random forests; Weather research and forecasting models","","","This research was funded by Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (Grant No. 22ZR1456100) and the Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Special Foundation (Grant No. CXXT-2023-06).","Skamarock, William C., A time-split nonhydrostatic atmospheric model for weather research and forecasting applications, Journal of Computational Physics, 227, 7, pp. 3465-3485, (2008); Chen, Fei, Coupling and advanced land surface-hydrology model with the Penn State-NCAR MM5 modeling system.

A common meteorological drought index used for drought monitoring and water resource management is the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Using SPEI can assist in predicting drought onset and estimating drought severity. The objective of this research is to assess the accuracy of machine learning models in estimating the SPEI-1 (one-month) index in semi-arid climates. To achieve this goal, the data will be analyzed using remote sensing parameters, a worldwide database, and meteorological station information. SPEI-1 was predicted in Tabriz, Iran, between 1990 and 2022 using multilayer perceptron (MLP) and random forest (RF) techniques combined with genetic algorithm (GA) methods. The parameters used are average air temperature, average relative humidity, monthly precipitation, wind speed, sunny hours, as well as the one-month standard precipitation index (SPI-1) (from ground data), daily precipitation products from satellites named PERSIANN (PRC-PR) (from remote sensing), and SPEIbase data (from global databases). The results suggest that the use of satellite remote sensing characteristics and global databases has significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of prediction models. Based on the GA-RF model with an R2 of 0.992 and an RMSE of 0.124, it exhibits the best performance among all models in Scenario 1. By combining remote sensing parameters, this study presents an innovative approach to predicting the SPEI index and demonstrates their capabilities in drought management and mitigation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic Algorithm; Global Databases; Persiann; Remote Sensing; Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; Crisis Management; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Genetic Algorithm; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing; Water Management; East Azerbaijan; Iran; Tabriz","crisis management; drought; evapotranspiration; genetic algorithm; machine learning; remote sensing; water management; East Azerbaijan; Iran; Tabriz","","","","Achite, Mohammed, Hydrological Drought Prediction Based on Hybrid Extreme Learning Machine: Wadi Mina Basin Case Study, Algeria, Atmosphere, 14, 9, (2023); Achite, Mohammed, Modeling of meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts in semi-arid environments with various machine learning and discrete wavelet transform, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 154, 1-2, pp. 413-451, (2023); Aksu, Hakan, Spatiotemporal analysis of drought by CHIRPS precipitation estimates, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 148, 1-2, pp. 517-529, (2022); Al-Hasani, Alaa Adel Jasim, Spatial distribution of the trends in potential evapotranspiration and its influencing climatic factors in Iraq, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 150, 1-2, pp. 677-696, (2022); Ali, Zulfiqar, Forecasting Drought Using Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network Model, Advances in Meteorology, 2017, (2017); Alvino, Arturo, Remote sensing for irrigation of horticultural crops, Horticulturae, 3, 2, (2017); Amoli, Abdolreza Ansari, Drought Risk Evaluation in Iran by Using Geospatial Technologies, Remote Sensing, 14, 13, (2022); Haji Seyed Asadollah, Seyed Babak, Estimation of soil moisture from remote sensing products using an ensemble machine learning model: a case study of Lake Urmia Basin, Iran, Earth Science Informatics, 17, 1, pp. 385-400, (2024); Ashouri, Hamed, PERSIANN-CDR: Daily precipitation climate data record from multisatellite observations for hydrological and climate studies, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 96, 1, pp. 69-83, (2015); Balbo, Fandy, The evaluation of drought indices: Standard Precipitation Index, Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, and Palmer Drought Severity Index in Cilacap-Central Java, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 303, 1, (2019)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","18650481; 18650473","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200557062"

We used national herbaria and global databases to assess the invasion trends of the two aquatic invasive species Ludwigia hexapetala and Ludwigia peploides subsp. montevidensis in Italy. We defined the invasion status with invasion curves and predicted potentially suitable areas with Species Distribution Models based on WorldClim variables and the human footprint index. Low seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation, temperature ≥ 20 °C in the driest period of the year and low precipitation in the coldest period are the bioclimatic factors that most account for the potential distribution of the two species. The human footprint has a lower relative importance than bioclimatic variables. All Italian peninsula appears as a suitable bioclimatic environment for the invasion of the two Ludwigia species, with over 90% of areas with high suitability lying below 600 m altitude. Only mountain regions and the islands appear less suitable. The agricultural land at the foothill of the Appennine in the Mediterranean region is the most vulnerable to the invasion. Considering the trend of the invasion curves, which have been sharply rising for the latest decades, there are reasons to expect that the alien Ludwigia species will continue their expansion, if no timely and effective actions are taken. Informative campaigns, accurate monitoring and prompt management are fundamental preventive tools in areas predicted as vulnerable to invasion by this study. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aquatic Plant Species; Distribution Models; Freshwater Ecosystems; Gbif; Herbarium Records; Invasion Curves","","","","We thank Prof. Duccio Rocchini of the University of Bologna for advice concerning SDM modelling in an early stage of the study, and anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on the manuscript.

To identify key underlying drivers of total SOC distributions, we compiled a global dataset of soil C stocks held in three chemical forms, reflecting different mechanisms of organic C protection: free particulate organic C (fPOC), physically protected particulate organic C (oPOC), and mineral-protected soil organic C (mSOC). In our dataset, these three SOC pools were differentially sensitive to the effects of climate, soil mineralogy, and ecosystem type, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between physical and chemical C protection mechanisms. C stocks in all three pools varied among ecosystems: cropland soils stored the least amount in each pool, with forest and grassland soils both containing significantly more fPOC (40%–60% greater in each ecosystem) than croplands. oPOC stocks did not significantly differ from zero in croplands but were substantial in forest and grassland soils. Meanwhile, mSOC stocks were the greatest in grasslands and shrublands (90%–100% greater than croplands). In cropland soils, there were no major effects of tillage on C storage in any of the three pools, while manure addition enhanced mSOC stocks, especially when added with inorganic N. Thus, the human land use intensity in croplands appears to reduce SOC storage in all major pools, depending upon management; retaining native vegetation should be emphasized to maintain current global SOC stocks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Mitigation; Land Use; Maom; Pom; Soil Density Fractionation; Soil Organic Carbon; Tillage; Carbon; Carbon; Soil; Carbon Storage; Climate Change; Fractionation; Land Use; Organic Carbon; Soil Carbon; Spatial Distribution; Carbon; Agriculture; Carbon Sequestration; Chemistry; Ecosystem; Forest; Procedures; Soil; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; Forests; Soil","carbon storage; climate change; fractionation; land use; organic carbon; soil carbon; spatial distribution; carbon; agriculture; carbon sequestration; chemistry; ecosystem; forest; procedures; soil; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; Forests; Soil","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon; Soil","","Terra Climate Web Server, (2024); Alberto Quesada, Carlos, Variations in soil chemical and physical properties explain basin-wide Amazon forest soil carbon concentrations, SOIL, 6, 1, pp. 53-88, (2020); Baker, John Mark, Tillage and soil carbon sequestration-What do we really know?, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 118, 1-4, pp. 1-5, (2007); Balesdent, Jérôme, Relationship of soil organic matter dynamics to physical protection and tillage, Soil and Tillage Research, 53, 3-4, pp. 215-230, (2000); Bates, Douglas M., Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4, Journal of Statistical Software, 67, 1, (2015); Bonan, Gordon B., Forests and climate change: Forcings, feedbacks, and the climate benefits of forests, Science, 320, 5882, pp. 1444-1449, (2008); Model Selection and Multimodel Inference A Practical Information Theoretic Approach, (2002); Cambardella, Cynthia A., Particulate soil organic-matter changes across a grassland cultivation sequence, Soil Science Society of America Journal, 56, 3, pp. 777-783, (1992); Campo, Julio E., Variations in soil carbon sequestration and their determinants along a precipitation gradient in seasonally dry tropical forest ecosystems, Global Change Biology, 22, 5, pp. 1942-1956, (2016); Chen, Qiuyu, Warming and increased precipitation indirectly affect the composition and turnover of labile-fraction soil organic matter by directly affecting vegetation and microorganisms, Science of the Total Environment, 714, (2020)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","13541013; 13652486","","","39295217","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204417875"

In addition to the regional cropland area reconstructions, improving the grid allocation method is another feasible way to raise the reliability of historical LUCC data. In this study, an integrated reconstruction of the national cropland areas over the past 200 years was developed for 36 European countries. After that, the allocation algorithm was built using physiogeographic variables and historical city sites for accounting for land suitability and cultivation preferences, respectively. Finally, cropland data in Europe with a spatial resolution of 5′×5′ at five time sections from AD 1800 to 2000 were generated using the optimal allocation algorithm in accordance with the stages of the regional history. The results were as follows: (1) The dominant factors governing the distribution of croplands in Europe vary at different agricultural stages, but the results can be merged together. Land suitability was more optimal for allocation during the modern agricultural stage (AD 1950 and 2000); the priority index combined with land suitability and cultivation preference was more reasonable for allocation during the traditional agricultural stage (AD 1800). The average of the allocations by priority index and the land suitability could be adopted as the allocation results during the transitional stage (AD 1850 and 1900) because the grids for absolute differences within ±10 and ±20 percentage points between the results obtained from the above two allocations were above 80% and 95%, respectively, which means the two allocation results could be merged. (2) Over the past 200 years, the total cropland area in Europe first increased to a peak in AD 1900 and then decreased. Spatially, the centre of the higher cropland fraction shifted from the western part of Europe in AD 1800 to the eastern part of the continent after AD 1950. (3) Both the cropland area and the spatial distribution in this study are more reasonable than the global dataset HYDE3.2. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Europe; Gridding Allocation; Historical Cropland; Land Use And Land Cover Change; Past 200 Years; Land Use; Allocation Algorithm; Europe; Global Change; Gridding; Gridding Allocation; Historical Cropland; Land Suitability; Land Use And Land Cover Change; Past 200 Year; Spatially Explicit; Cultivation; Algorithm; Cultivation; Data Set; Global Change; Land Cover; Land Use Change; Spatial Distribution","Land use; Allocation algorithm; Europe; Global change; Gridding; Gridding allocation; Historical cropland; Land suitability; Land use and land cover change; Past 200 year; Spatially explicit; Cultivation; algorithm; cultivation; data set; global change; land cover; land use change; spatial distribution","","","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFA0603304).","European Review of Economic History, (2000); Bai, Yang, Ecosystem service supply and demand: Theory and management application, Shengtai Xuebao, 37, 17, pp. 5846-5852, (2017); Urban Geography, (1967); Bele, Bolette, Traditional land use of the boreal forest landscape: Examples from Lierne, Nord-Trøndelag, Norway, Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift, 67, 1, pp. 12-23, (2013); Meyers Groes Konversations Lexikon, (2025); Proceedings of the ESA Living Planet Symposium, (2013); Brovkin, Victor A., Effect of anthropogenic land-use and land-cover changes on climate and land carbon storage in CMIP5 projections for the twenty-first century, Journal of Climate, 26, 18, pp. 6859-6881, (2013); Bucała-Hrabia, Anna, Long-term impact of socio-economic changes on agricultural land use in the Polish Carpathians, Land Use Policy, 64, pp. 391-404, (2017); Cesaretti, Rudolf, Population-area relationship for medieval European cities, PLOS ONE, 11, 10, (2016); Central Places in Southern Germany, (2010)","","Science China Press","","","","","","16747313; 18691897","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200999146"

However, these indicators do not reflect the contribution of inherent soil productivity, which can supply half of crop demand and is therefore a core principle in determining how much fertilizer is needed and the corresponding risk of N losses. Using a global dataset of optimal N rates for crop production, we evaluated the performance of conventional (N recovery efficiency) and simplified NUE indicators to understand their relationship and respective limitations, helping inform policy efforts for simultaneously meeting food production and sustainability goals. A key finding is that conventional agronomic approaches designed to optimize crop productivity and profit related to N fertilizer inputs have tradeoffs for environmental performance, with only 35 and 31 % of observations (n=448) falling within sustainable ranges for NUE. Meanwhile, simplified NUE indicators such as N balance or the ratio of N outputs to inputs were unable to detect sites with inherently low N recovery efficiency and high risk of N losses, highlighting a weakness of neglecting soil N supply in their calculations. Together these results suggest the need for a combined approach that merges insights from locally available agronomic data on N recovery efficiency with global environmental thresholds for NUE. Using our findings as a case study, we propose new steps forward for evaluating NUE in different cropping systems and regions to enhance food security while mitigating N pollution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; N Balance; N Inputs; N Recovery Efficiency; Sustainability; Agricultural Management; Alternative Agriculture; Cropping Practice; Fertilizer Application; Food Production; Food Security; Nutrient Use Efficiency; Soil Nutrient; Sustainability","agricultural management; alternative agriculture; cropping practice; fertilizer application; food production; food security; nutrient use efficiency; soil nutrient; sustainability","","","","Ahrens, Toby D., Narrowing the agronomic yield gap with improved nitrogen use efficiency: A modeling approach, Ecological Applications, 20, 1, pp. 91-100, (2010); undefined, (2022); Blesh, Jennifer M., The impact of nitrogen source and crop rotation on nitrogen mass balances in the Mississippi River Basin, Ecological Applications, 23, 5, pp. 1017-1035, (2013); Bodirsky, Benjamin Leon, Reactive nitrogen requirements to feed the world in 2050 and potential to mitigate nitrogen pollution, Nature Communications, 5, (2014); Bonilla-Cedrez, Camila, Fertilizer and grain prices constrain food production in sub-Saharan Africa, Nature Food, 2, 10, pp. 766-772, (2021); Bowles, Timothy M., Addressing agricultural nitrogen losses in a changing climate, Nature Sustainability, 1, 8, pp. 399-408, (2018); Briat, Jean François, Reappraisal of the central role of soil nutrient availability in nutrient management in light of recent advances in plant nutrition at crop and molecular levels, European Journal of Agronomy, 116, (2020); Bundy, Larry G., Diagnostic tests for site-specific nitrogen recommendations for winter wheat, Agronomy Journal, 96, 3, pp. 608-614, (2004); Cai, Siyuan, Optimal nitrogen rate strategy for sustainable rice production in China, Nature, 615, 7950, pp. 73-79, (2023); Cao, Yansheng, Organic-C quality as a key driver of microbial nitrogen immobilization in soil: A meta-analysis, Geoderma, 383, (2021)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","11610301","","EJAGE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195883654"

Improvements in the automated disease detection and analysis areas may provide important benefits for early action that would allow intervention at earlier stages for cure and preventing spread of the disease. As a result, damages on crop yield could be minimized. This study proposes a new deep-learning model that correctly classifies plant leaf diseases for the agriculture and food sectors. It focuses on the detection of plant diseases for potato leaves from images by designing a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The CNN methodology applies filters to input images, extracts key features, reduces dimensions while preserving important characteristics in images, and finally, performs classification. The experimental results conducted on a real-world dataset showed that a significant improvement (8.6%) in accuracy was achieved on average by the proposed model (98.28%) compared to the state-of-the-art models (89.67%) in the literature. The weighted averages of recall, precision, and f-score metrics were obtained around 0.978, meaning that the method was highly successful in disease diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Disease Diagnosis; Image Classification; Plantvillage; Smart Farming","","","","","Rao, Wakeel Ahmad, Plants disease phenotyping using quinary patterns as texture descriptor, KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, 14, 8, pp. 3312-3327, (2020); Ahmed, Imtiaz, A systematic analysis of machine learning and deep learning based approaches for identifying and diagnosing plant diseases, Sustainable Operations and Computers, 4, pp. 96-104, (2023); Aparajita, Image processing based automated identification of late blight disease from leaf images of potato crops, 2017-January, pp. 758-762, (2017); Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University Journal of Engineering Sciences, (2022); Aurangzeb, Khursheed, Advanced Machine Learning Algorithm Based System for Crops Leaf Diseases Recognition, pp. 146-151, (2020); Bayram, Fatih, Classification of Some Barley Cultivars with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi, 29, 1, pp. 262-271, (2023); Bhagat, Monu, Efficient feature selection using BoWs and SURF method for leaf disease identification, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 82, 18, pp. 28187-28211, (2023); International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology, (2020); European Journal of Science and Technology, (2022); Cinar, Ilkay, Identification of Rice Varieties Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi, 28, 2, pp. 307-325, (2022)","","Ankara University","","","","","","13007580","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183048253"

By using standardized methods and the most recent Bayesian tracer mixing models MixSIAR, this study aimed to quantify source contributions, burial rates, and stocks of organic carbon (C<inf>org</inf>) and explore their temporal changes (∼100 years) in seven lead-210 dated sediment cores collected from three contrasting Mexican mangrove areas. The spatial variation in C<inf>org</inf> burial rates and stocks in these blue carbon ecosystems primarily depended on the influence of local rivers, which controlled C<inf>org</inf> sources and fluxes within the mangrove areas. The C<inf>org</inf> burial rates in the cores ranged from 66 ± 16 to 400 ± 40 g m−2 yr−1. The C<inf>org</inf> stocks ranged from 84.9 ± 0.7 to 255 ± 2 Mg ha−1 at 50 cm depth and from 137 ± 2 to 241 ± 4 Mg ha−1 at 1 m depth. The highest C<inf>org</inf> burial rates and stocks were observed in cores from the carbonate platform of Yucatan and in cores with reduced river influence and high mangrove detritus inputs, in contrast to patterns identified from global databases. Over the past century, the rising trends in C<inf>org</inf> burial rates and stocks in the study sites were primarily driven by enhanced inputs of fluvial-derived C<inf>org</inf> and, in some cores, mangrove-derived C<inf>org</inf>. Despite their decreasing extension, mangrove areas remained highly effective producers and sinks of C<inf>org</inf>. Ongoing efforts to enhance the global database should continue, including mangrove area characteristics and reliable timescales to facilitate cross-comparison among studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","210pb Radiochronology; Blue Carbon; Burial Rate; Mangroves; Mixsiar; Stock; Cadmium; Cesium 137; Nitrogen; Radium 226; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Acid; Lead 210; Delta V Advantage; Flash 2000; Atmospheric Chemistry; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Ecosystems; Magnesium; 210pb Radiochronology; Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide; Blue Carbon; Burial Rate; Carbon Accumulation; Carbon Sink; Global Database; Mangrove; Mixsiar; Stock; Organic Carbon; Cadmium; Cesium 137; Nitrogen; Organic Carbon; Radium 226; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Acid; Lead 210; Tracer; Accumulation; Carbonate Platform; Climate Change; Database; Lead; Mangrove; Agriculture; Algal Bloom; Aquaculture; Article; Bulk Density; Catchment Area (hydrology); Detritus; Geographic Distribution; Isotope Labeling; Land Biome; Mass Spectrometry; Monte Carlo Method; Nonhuman; Particulate Matter; Phytoplankton; Population Growth; Sea Surface Temperature; Sedimentation; Water Quality; Article; Burial; Carbon Sequestration; Carbon Sink; Data Base; Mexican; River; Sediment; Yucatan; Mexico [north America]","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Ecosystems; Magnesium; 210pb radiochronology; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Blue carbon; Burial rate; Carbon accumulation; Carbon sink; Global database; Mangrove; MixSIAR; Stock; Organic carbon; cadmium; cesium 137; nitrogen; organic carbon; radium 226; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbonic acid; lead 210; tracer; accumulation; carbonate platform; climate change; database; lead; mangrove; agriculture; algal bloom; aquaculture; Article; bulk density; catchment area (hydrology); detritus; geographic distribution; isotope labeling; land biome; mass spectrometry; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; particulate matter; phytoplankton; population growth; sea surface temperature; sedimentation; water quality; article; burial; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; data base; Mexican; river; sediment; Yucatan; Mexico [North America]","","cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; cesium 137, 10045-97-3; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; radium 226, 13982-63-3; carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbonic acid, 3812-32-6, 463-79-6; lead 210, 14255-04-0","This work was possible due to the support of the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00F3noma de M\u00E9xico (UNAM) through the project PAPIIT-DGAPA IN102821, and of the Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00E9veloppement (IRD) through the international network DEXICOTROP and the Alys\u00E9s platform facilities for geochemical and isotopic analyses.

The understanding and treatment of land vary greatly across different regions and communities, making the description of land highly specific to each locality. To address the larger global issues, such as world food production or climate change mitigation, one needs to have a common standardized understanding of the biosphere cover and use of land. Different governments and institutions established national systems to describe thematic content of land within their jurisdictions. These systems are all valid and tuned to address various national needs. However, their integration at regional or global levels is lacking. Integrating data from widely divergent sources to create world datasets not only requires standards, but also an approach to integrate national and regional land cover classification systems. The ISO 19144 series, developed through the collaboration between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), offers a meta-language for the integration of disparate land classification systems, enhancing interoperability, data sharing, and national to global data integration and comparison. This paper provides an overview of classification system concepts, different stages for the development of standards in ISO and the status of different standards in the ISO 19144 series. It also explores the critical role of the ISO 19144 series in standardizing land cover and land use classification systems. Drawing on practical case studies, the paper underscores the series’ potential to support global sustainable development goals and lays out a path for its future development and application. Using these standards, we gain not only a tool for harmonizing land classification, but also a critical level for advancing sustainable development and environmental stewardship worldwide. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Geospatial; Harmonization; Integration; Interoperability; Land Characterization; Semantic Ontology; Land Classification; Land Cover; Land Use; Standard (regulation); Sustainable Development","land classification; land cover; land use; standard (regulation); sustainable development","","","","Nedd, Ryan, A synthesis of land use/land cover studies: Definitions, classification systems, meta-studies, challenges and knowledge gaps on a global landscape, Land, 10, 9, (2021); 14 Global Fundamental Geospatial Data Themes, (2018); Xie, Guanyao, Mapping and monitoring of land cover/land use (LCLU) changes in the crozon peninsula (Brittany, France) from 2007 to 2018 by machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, random forest, and convolutional neural network) and by post-classification comparison (PCC), Remote Sensing, 13, 19, (2021); Wang, Junye, Machine learning in modelling land-use and land cover-change (LULCC): Current status, challenges and prospects, Science of the Total Environment, 822, (2022); Practical Handbook for Agricultural Land Cover Mapping in the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, (2020); A Rapid Geospatial Analysis of the Impact of in Madagascar Malawi Mozambique Zambia and Zimbabwe, (2022); A Rapid Geospatial Analysis of the Impact of the Hunga Tonga Volcano Eruption, (2022); Shumilo, Leonid L., Use of land cover maps as indicators for achieving sustainable development goals, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2018-July, pp. 830-833, (2018); FAO E Learning Academy, (2020); Yılmaz, Rüya, Monitoring land use/land cover changes using CORINE land cover data: A case study of Silivri coastal zone in Metropolitan Istanbul, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 165, 1-4, pp. 603-615, (2010)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","2073445X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202618049"

Leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles, we can efficiently acquire high-resolution spatiotemporal samples by utilizing remote sensors. However, non-linear relationships among data features, localized within specific subgroups, frequently emerge in agricultural data. Interpreting these complex patterns requires sophisticated analysis due to the presence of noise, high variability, and non-stationarity behavior in the collected samples. Here, we introduce Local Biplot, a methodological framework tailored for discerning meaningful data patterns in non-stationary contexts for precision agriculture. Local Biplot relies on the well-known uniform manifold approximation and projection method, such as UMAP, and local affine transformations to codify non-stationary and non-linear data patterns while maintaining interpretability. This lets us find important clusters for transformation and projection within a single global axis pair. Hence, our framework encompasses variable and observational contributions within individual clusters. At the same time, we provide a relevance analysis strategy to help explain why those clusters exist, facilitating the understanding of data dynamics while favoring interpretability. We demonstrated our method’s capabilities through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, covering scenarios involving grass and rice crops. Moreover, we use random forest and linear regression models to predict water status variables from our Local Biplot-based feature ranking and clusters.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing techniques are regarded as a feasible coping strategy to the sustainability dilemmas confronted in the domain. In this paper, we evaluate current multisensor information fusion technologies including both traditional methods and deep learning approaches for remote monitoring in real agricultural scenes and investigate their applicability for detecting burning rice straw. To this end, we collect StrawBurning, a real-world dataset containing fully paired infrared and visible images through mapping ground scenes based on UAV remote sensing. Furthermore, we propose a novel multiscale contrast adaptation (MCA) method for efficient multisensor image fusion and accurate straw burning detection in real farmland scenarios. The MCA remarkably enhanced the detection performance of YOLOv5 on the StrawBurning data by approximately 3%, 2%, and 5%, in terms of recall, mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95, respectively. Therefore, our proposed method is demonstrated to obtain the superior performance compared to the single-modal information and other advanced multisensor information fusion methods.

In the last decade, the number of forest N<inf>2</inf>O studies has increased more than tenfold, but only a few of them have looked into the interannual flux variabilities from the regional scale. Here, we have collected 30 long-term N<inf>2</inf>O monitoring studies (≥ 2 years) based on a global database, and extracted variabilities (VAR<inf>Flux</inf>) as well as relative variabilities (VAR<inf>%</inf>, in proportions) of annual N<inf>2</inf>O fluxes. The relationship of mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), and nitrogen (N) deposition with flux variabilities was examined to explore the underlying mechanisms for N<inf>2</inf>O emission on a long-term scale. Our results show that mean VAR<inf>Flux</inf> is 0.43 kg N ha−1 yr−1 and VAR<inf>%</inf> is 28.68%. Across climatic zones, the subtropical forests have the largest annual N<inf>2</inf>O fluxes, as well as the largest fluctuations among annual budgets, while the tropics were the smallest. We found that the regulating factors for VAR<inf>Flux</inf> and VAR<inf>%</inf> are fundamentally different, i.e., MAT and N input determine the annual fluxes as well as VAR<inf>Flux</inf> while MAP and other limiting soil parameters determine VAR<inf>%</inf>. The relative contributions of different seasons to flux variabilities were also explored, indicating that N<inf>2</inf>O fluxes of warm and cool seasons are more responsible for the fluctuations in annual fluxes of the (sub)tropical and temperate forests, respectively. Overall, despite the limitation in interpretations due to few long-term studies from literature, this work highlights that significant interannual variabilities are common phenomena for N<inf>2</inf>O emission from different climatic zones forest soils; by unraveling the divergent drivers for VAR<inf>Flux</inf> and VAR<inf>%</inf>, we have provided the possibility of improving N<inf>2</inf>O simulation models for constraining the heterogeneity of N<inf>2</inf>O emission processes from climatic zones forest soils. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forest Soils; Interannual Variabilities; N2o Fluxes; Ammonia; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Spss 27; Budget Control; Nitrogen Oxides; Soils; Tropics; Value Engineering; Annual Flux; Climatic Zone; Field Observations; Flux Variability; Forest Soils; Interannual Variability; Mean Annual Precipitation; Mean Annual Temperatures; N2o Flux; Nitrous Oxide; Forestry; Ammonia; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Annual Variation; Atmospheric Chemistry; Climatic Region; Deposition; Forest Soil; Oxygen; Soil Emission; Soil Moisture; Agricultural Land; Article; Budget; Climate Change; Controlled Study; Data Extraction; Nitrous Oxide Emission; Nonhuman; Precipitation; Simulation; Temperature; Article; Data Base; Forest; Soil; Soil Property; Temperate Deciduous Forest","Budget control; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Tropics; Value engineering; Annual flux; Climatic zone; Field observations; Flux variability; Forest soils; Interannual variability; Mean annual precipitation; Mean annual temperatures; N2O flux; Nitrous oxide; Forestry; ammonia; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; annual variation; atmospheric chemistry; climatic region; deposition; forest soil; oxygen; soil emission; soil moisture; agricultural land; Article; budget; climate change; controlled study; data extraction; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; precipitation; simulation; temperature; article; data base; forest; soil; soil property; temperate deciduous forest","","ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2","We are grateful to the authors and organizations publishing the data used in this study.

To achieve this, two databases were used, one consisting of ground-based measurements and the other containing six reanalysis products for temperature (T), root zone soil moisture (SM), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and precipitation (P) variables during the 1987–2019 period. The accuracy of the global database data was assessed using statistical criteria in both single- and multi-product approaches for the aforementioned four variables. In addition, five different feature selection methods were employed to select the best single condition indices (SCIs) as input for the support vector regression (SVR) model. The superior multi-products based on time series (SMT) showed increased accuracy for P, T, PET, and SM variables, with an average 47%, 41%, 42%, and 52% reduction in mean absolute error compared to SSP. In hyperarid climate regions, PET condition index was found to have high relative importance with 40% and 36% contributions to SPEI-3 and SPEI-6, respectively. This suggests that PET plays a key role in agricultural drought in hyperarid regions because of very low precipitation. Additionally, the accuracy results of different feature selection methods show that ReliefF outperformed other feature selection methods in agricultural drought modeling. The characteristics of agricultural drought indicate the occurrence of drought in 2017 and 2018 in various climates in Iran, particularly arid and semi-arid climates, with five instances and an average duration of 12 months of drought in humid climates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Drought; Climates Of Iran; Combined Condition Indices; Feature Selection Methods; Support Vector Regression; Agriculture; Arid Regions; Climate Models; Feature Selection; Soil Moisture; Support Vector Machines; Agricultural Drought; Climate Of Iran; Combined Condition Index; Condition Index; Feature Selection Methods; Features Selection; Machine Learning Models; Multi-products; Potential Evapotranspiration; Support Vector Regressions; Drought; Agriculture; Climate; Drought; Machine Learning; Model; Prediction; Support Vector Machine; Iran","Agriculture; Arid regions; Climate models; Feature Selection; Soil moisture; Support vector machines; Agricultural drought; Climate of iran; Combined condition index; Condition index; Feature selection methods; Features selection; Machine learning models; Multi-products; Potential evapotranspiration; Support vector regressions; Drought; agriculture; climate; drought; machine learning; model; prediction; support vector machine; Iran","","","","Abatzoglou, John T., TerraClimate, a high-resolution global dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance from 1958-2015, Scientific Data, 5, (2018); Faiz, Muhammad Abrar, Drought index revisited to assess its response to vegetation in different agro-climatic zones, Journal of Hydrology, 614, (2022); Alhenawi, Esra’A, Feature selection methods on gene expression microarray data for cancer classification: A systematic review, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 140, (2022); Ali, Shoaib, Constructing high-resolution groundwater drought at spatio-temporal scale using GRACE satellite data based on machine learning in the Indus Basin, Journal of Hydrology, 612, (2022); Alizadeh, Mohammad Reza, A fusion-based methodology for meteorological drought estimation using remote sensing data, Remote Sensing of Environment, 211, pp. 229-247, (2018); Alkaraki, Khaled F., A comprehensive remote sensing-based Agriculture Drought Condition Indicator (CADCI) using machine learning, Environmental Challenges, 11, (2023); Allen, Richard Glen, A recommendation on standardized surface resistance for hourly calculation of reference ETo by the FAO56 Penman-Monteith method, Agricultural Water Management, 81, 1-2, pp. 1-22, (2006); Allen, Richard Glen, Satellite-based energy balance for mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration (METRIC) - Applications, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering - ASCE, 133, 4, pp. 395-406, (2007); Crop Evapotranspiration Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements, (1998); Alliès, Aubin, A remote sensing data fusion method for continuous daily evapotranspiration mapping at kilometric scale in Sahelian areas, Journal of Hydrology, 607, (2022)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21905487; 21905495","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192957778"

With increased duration, the changes in soil N availability might affect microbial and plant growth and consequently regulate the intercropping effects on SOC sequestration. However, the response of intercropping effects on SOC components to soil N availability has been poorly explored. In this study, we constructed a global database with 939 paired data (intercropping vs. monoculture) from 60 publications. We found that intercropping increased SOC (by 7.94%), microbial biomass carbon (MBC, by 23.73%), particulate organic carbon (POC, by 23.27%), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, by 16.46%) compared to monoculture. The intercropping effects (percentage change, %) on SOC content strongly depends on soil N availability (soil C: N) and the interactions with duration and crop types. In N-limited soils (soil C: N > 15), intercropping increased SOC and POC contents by 14% and 31%, respectively, which were 2–3 times higher than those in N-rich soils (soil C: N < 15). It implies higher intercropping effects in more N-limited soils. In addition, intercropping increased MBC:SOC by 63% in N-limited but not in N-rich soils, indicating greater contributions of microbial-derived C to SOC storage in N-limited but not in N-rich soils. This might be attributed to that the stimulated microbial decomposition of soil organic matter counterbalanced the microbial-derived C accumulation in N-rich soils. Taken together, these results indicate that soil N availability regulates the intercropping effects on SOC content and the contributions of microbial-derived C to SOC storage. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of soil N availability on SOC content with intercropping, implying that intercropping is a suitable agricultural approach especially in N-limited soils and nutrient management should be carefully considered in long-term intercropping experiments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Fraction; Intercropping Effects; Management Practice; Microbial Biomass Carbon; Soil Nitrogen Availability; Crops; Cultivation; Digital Storage; Nitrogen; Organic Carbon; Plants (botany); Carbon Fraction; Effect On Soils; Intercropping Effect; Management Practises; Microbial Biomass Carbon; N Availability; Nitrogen Availability; Soil Nitrogen; Soil Nitrogen Availability; Soil Organic Carbon; Soils; Agricultural Ecosystem; Decomposition; Dissolved Organic Carbon; Intercropping; Management Practice; Nutrient Availability; Nutrient Limitation; Particulate Organic Carbon; Soil Nitrogen","Crops; Cultivation; Digital storage; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Carbon fraction; Effect on soils; Intercropping effect; Management practises; Microbial biomass carbon; N availability; Nitrogen availability; Soil nitrogen; Soil nitrogen availability; Soil organic carbon; Soils; agricultural ecosystem; decomposition; dissolved organic carbon; intercropping; management practice; nutrient availability; nutrient limitation; particulate organic carbon; soil nitrogen","","","Funding text 1: This research work was supported by the start-up funding for introduced talents in Guangxi University ( A3310051077, EE101734 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 42207388 ).

Researchers and machinery manufacturers identified electrified powertrains as a possible solution to meet this demand. The development of field-effective electrified powertrains is challenging mostly due to the wide variability of operating conditions of agricultural tractors. While the automotive industry adopted reference driving cycles for the design and evaluation of hybrid powertrains, the tractor industry has not been able to easily record external load in real-world conditions as it requires dedicated systems that cannot be used under prolonged field usages. This study aims to provide a methodology for estimating a reference working cycle from a multi-year dataset using technologies available in current commercial tractors. Data were collected on a tractor used for 3 years of agricultural work. Data were first clustered into work states, then, for each state, signal features from on-tractor sensors were used to extract key factors to compute the reference work state. With an optimisation solver and a hidden Markov model, the reference working cycle that synthesised the real-world tractor use was calculated. This cycle was compared with established cycles for non-road mobile machinery. The new reference cycle better represented real-world tractor usage as it also complied with low engine operations, which are frequent in farming and mostly associated with machine setup. The new reference working cycle permits a reliable estimation of fuel consumption of real-world farming. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Canbus; Data Mining; Efficiency; Engine Operating Point; Real-world Data; Automotive Industry; Climate Change; Energy Policy; Engines; Farms; Hidden Markov Models; Powertrains; Tractors (agricultural); Tractors (truck); Can Bus; Current Energy; Energy Crisis; Engine Operating Point; Machinery Manufacturer; Operating Points; Real-world; Real-world Data; Technological Solution; Working Cycle; Data Mining","Automotive industry; Climate change; Energy policy; Engines; Farms; Hidden Markov models; Powertrains; Tractors (agricultural); Tractors (truck); CAN bus; Current energy; Energy crisis; Engine operating point; Machinery manufacturer; Operating points; Real-world; Real-world data; Technological solution; Working cycle; Data mining","","","The data collection of this project was supported by MUR (Ministry of University and Research) under the 2017 PRIN (Research Projects of Significant National Interest) call notification \u2018Green SEED: Design of more-electric tractors for a more sustainable agriculture\u2019, grant number: 2017SW5MRC.

The present study assesses the spatiotemporal variations of five highly used pesticides namely Ametryn, Atrazine, Diuron, Glyphosate, and Paraquat in Northeast of Thailand. Eighteen Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) weather station sites from Northeast of Thailand were considered to model flow and transport of pesticide chemicals through multi-layered soils using a process based HYDRUS-1D model in this study. We have used reliable climatic datasets from TMD, soil properties from Harmonised World Soil Database, pesticide properties from Pesticides Properties DataBase, and global soil moisture datasets from Global Land Data Assimilation System to assess the pesticide leaching risk. HYDRUS-1D model validation performance was highly satisfactory with root mean square error values less than 0.05 and with a percent bias range of − 10 to 10% at 72% of the total selected sites in the study area. The simulated concentration from bottom of the soil profile for Diuron and Ametryn pesticides were exceeding a threshold concentration of 1 µg/L at few TMD sites in the study area. The leaching risk assessment reveals that Ametryn and Diuron shows high risk of leaching in the northeastern part of the study area while other pesticides, Atrazine, Glyphosate and Paraquat, leaching risk were classified from very low to no risk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gldas Soil Moisture; Hydrus-1d; Multi-layer Soil; Pesticides Leaching Risk; Ppdb; Solute Transport; Data Set; Leaching; Pesticide; Risk Assessment; Soil Moisture; Soil Pollution; Solute Transport; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Thailand","data set; leaching; pesticide; risk assessment; soil moisture; soil pollution; solute transport; spatiotemporal analysis; Thailand","","","","Akbar, Tahir Ali, GIS based ArcPRZM-3 model for bentazon leaching towards groundwater, Journal of Environmental Sciences (China), 22, 12, pp. 1854-1859, (2010); Alavi, Ghasem, Evaluation of dual-permeability models for chemical leaching assessment to assist pesticide regulation in Hawaii, Vadose Zone Journal, 6, 4, pp. 735-745, (2007); Aliste, M., Risk Assessment of 1,2,4-Triazole-Typed Fungicides for Groundwater Pollution Using Leaching Potential Indices, Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 232, 11, (2021); Anlauf, Ruediger, Coupling HYDRUS-1D with ArcGIS to estimate pesticide accumulation and leaching risk on a regional basis, Journal of Environmental Management, 217, pp. 980-990, (2018); Proc Ix Symposium Pesticide Chemistry Mobility and Degradation of Xenobiotics, (1993); Nogueira Bandeira, Jesley, Leaching of Herbicides in Soil under the Influence of Different Rainfall Intensities, Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 233, 6, (2022); Gldas Catchment Land Surface Model L4 Daily 0 25 X 0 25 Degree Grace Da1 V2 2, (2020); Beegum, Sahila, Implementation of Solute Transport in the Vadose Zone into the “HYDRUS Package for MODFLOW”, Ground Water, 57, 3, pp. 392-408, (2019); Beegum, Sahila, Investigating atrazine concentrations in the Zwischenscholle aquifer using MODFLOW with the HYDRUS-1D package and MT3DMS, Water (Switzerland), 12, 4, (2020); Berlin, Mohanadhas, Numerical investigations on feasibility of surfactant enhanced remediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in an unsaturated subsurface system beneath an onshore surface spill site, International Journal of Environmental Technology and Management, 20, 5-6, pp. 321-346, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","23636211; 23636203","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186204872"

In this paper, we present an evaluation of a synthetically generated top-down shadow segmentation dataset characterized by photorealistic rendering and accurate shadow masks. We aim to determine its efficacy compared to real-world datasets and assess how factors such as annotation quality and image domain influence neural network model training. To establish a baseline, we trained numerous baseline architectures and subsequently explored transfer learning using various freely available shadow datasets. We further evaluated the out-of-domain performance compared to the training set of other shadow datasets.

This work aims to assess whether an uncalibrated agro-hydrological model using global input datasets for climate, soil and crop information can serve as a decision support tool for crop water management under data scarcity. This study employs the Cool Farm Tool Water (CFTW) at eight eddy covariance sites of the FLUXNET2015 dataset. CFTW is tested using global (CFTWglobal) and local (CFTWlocal) input datasets under current and alternative management scenarios. Results show that the use of global datasets for estimating daily evapotranspiration had little effect on the median Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (CFTWglobal: 1.70 mm, CFTWlocal: 1.79 mm), while, however, the median model bias is much greater (CFTWglobal: −18.6%, CFTWlocal: −4.3%). Furthermore, the periods of water stress were little affected by the use of local or global data (median accuracy: 0.84), whereas the use of global data inputs led to a significant overestimation of irrigation water requirements (median difference: 110 mm). The model performance improves predominantly through the use of more representative local precipitation data, followed by local reference evapotranspiration and soil for some European growing seasons. We identify model outputs that can support decision-making when relying on global data, such as periods of water stress and the daily dynamics of water use. However, our findings also emphasize the difficulty of overcoming data scarcity in decision-making in agricultural water management. Furthermore, we provide recommendations for enhancing model performance and thus may increase the accessibility of reliable decision support tools in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cool Farm Tool; Crop Water Requirement; Crop Water Use; Evapotranspiration; Fao56; Irrigation; Climate Models; Crops; Decision Making; Decision Support Systems; Farms; Irrigation; Mean Square Error; Water Management; Water Supply; Agricultural Water Management; Cool Farm Tool; Crop Water Requirements; Crop Water Use; Data Scarcity; Decision Supports; Decisions Makings; Fao56; Global Data; Global Datasets; Evapotranspiration; Alternative Agriculture; Calibration; Data Set; Decision Support System; Eddy Covariance; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Software; Water Management; Water Use","Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Decision support systems; Farms; Irrigation; Mean square error; Water management; Water supply; Agricultural water management; Cool farm tool; Crop water requirements; Crop water use; Data scarcity; Decision supports; Decisions makings; FAO56; Global data; Global datasets; Evapotranspiration; alternative agriculture; calibration; data set; decision support system; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; irrigation; software; water management; water use","","","The authors like to thank Climate KIC for financial support.

This study explores the integration of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to optimize soil moisture estimation. By combining data from WSN nodes with satellite and climate data, this research aims to enhance the accuracy and resolution of soil moisture estimation, enabling more effective agricultural planning, irrigation management, and environmental monitoring. Five ML models, including linear regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and long short-term memory networks (LSTM), are evaluated and compared using real-world data from multiple geographical regions, which includes a dataset from NASA’s SMAP project, supplemented by climate data, which employs both active and passive sensors for data collection. The outcomes demonstrate that the LSTM model consistently outperforms other ML algorithms across various evaluation metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of WSN-driven approaches to soil moisture estimation. The study contributes to the advancement of soil moisture monitoring technologies, offering insights into the potential of WSNs combined with ML and DL for sustainable agriculture and environmental management practices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Lstm (long Short-term Memory); Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Soil Moisture Estimation; Wireless Sensor Networks (wsns)","","","","This research was partly supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (No. NRF-2022R1I1A3072355, 50%) and Innovative Human Resource Development for Local Intellectualization program through the Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (IITP-2024-2020-0-01462, 50%).","Acharya, Umesh, Machine learning for predicting field soil moisture using soil, crop, and nearby weather station data in the red river valley of the north, Soil Systems, 5, 4, (2021); Kumar, Sujay V., Information theoretic evaluation of satellite soil moisture retrievals, Remote Sensing of Environment, 204, pp. 392-400, (2018); Mittelbach, Heidi, Soil moisture monitoring for climate research: Evaluation of a low-cost sensor in the framework of the Swiss soil moisture experiment (SwissSMEX) campaign, Journal of Geophysical Research, 116, 5, (2011); Mladenova, Iliana E., Agricultural Drought Monitoring via the Assimilation of SMAP Soil Moisture Retrievals Into a Global Soil Water Balance Model, Frontiers in Big Data, 3, (2020); Rajib, Adnan, Multi-objective calibration of a hydrologic model using spatially distributed remotely sensed/in-situ soil moisture, Journal of Hydrology, 536, pp. 192-207, (2016); Saxton, Keith E., Soil water characteristic estimates by texture and organic matter for hydrologic solutions, Soil Science Society of America Journal, 70, 5, pp. 1569-1578, (2006); Nature and Properties of Soils, (1999); Entekhabi, Dara, The soil moisture active passive (SMAP) mission, Proceedings of the IEEE, 98, 5, pp. 704-716, (2010); Singh, Tinku, Analysis and forecasting of air quality index based on satellite data, Inhalation Toxicology, 35, 1-2, pp. 24-39, (2023); Singh, Abhilash, Deep learning and data fusion to estimate surface soil moisture from multi-sensor satellite images, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20799292","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191390807"

The FMR models can be written as problems with incomplete data, and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm can be used to estimate unknown variables. The goals of this research are to find the best clustering model with different sets of training and test data and examine the relationship between crop production index and methane emissions in 22 countries from 1990 to 2019 using FMR. In this study also use machine learning process for a FMR model from real world data. According to the findings, the performance of the random training data (RDM) in time series is preferable to that of the fixed training data (FXM). In addition, both RDM and FXM are capable of classifying the 22 countries into two distinct groups and constructing the parameters for the regression model. However, selecting training and test data will result in a good prediction; it is dependent on the data collected.

The hyperspectral identification of rice seeds is of great significance to the development of agriculture and hence has made remarkable achievements. However, the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets with a large number of rice seeds hinders the generalization of models and limits the advancement of the field. To address this issue, this study proposes a publicly accessible dataset for rice seed classification by hyperspectral imaging system. The proposed dataset contains 6 categories of nearly 10,000 seeds each and is characterized by (1) a large scale on the number of seeds per category and the total seed number; (2) a greater adherence to real-world scenarios; and (3) high intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity. Based on the proposed dataset, an Instance Difficulty-weighted K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (IDKNN) is further proposed. It is a credible algorithm, emphasizing individual seed accuracy rather than overall performance. Additionally, we explore the effects of different Regions Of Interest (ROI). Experimental results constitute the baseline performance of the proposed dataset. Compared with 10 representative algorithms, the IDKNN algorithm achieves the best performance, especially on the ROI of the entire seed.

However, current knowledge of climate change impacts in this region is largely derived from coarse-grid global datasets that lack sufficient detail for local applications. The derived impacts are thus generalized across large spatial scales, with a limited representation the differential exposure across the region. It is thus necessary to conduct localized assessments to derive local vulnerabilities and develop context-specific mitigation strategies. This study utilizes downscaled outputs from regional climate models to quantify the effects of climate change on maize and sugarcane crops at catchment-scale, hereby the Nyando catchment in Kenya. The findings indicate that climate change will reduce the suitability of conditions to the growth of both crops, with sub-optimal conditions for maize increasing by up to 600%. The analysis of crop yields show that maize yields are projected to decline by about 23.9% under the RCP4.5 scenario and 29.4% under RCP8.5. Sugarcane yields are similarly projected to decrease by 17.0% and 28.6% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. The underlying climatic changes suggest that future warming outweighs the effects of precipitation in explaining crop yield declines. More broadly, the methodology applied in this study can be readily adapted and utilized for agricultural areas throughout the Sub-Saharan region. By adopting this localized impact assessment approach policymakers and sector players will be empowered with information at a higher spatial detail which empowers targeted, region-specific adaptation strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Climate Change; Crop Water Use; Crop Yields; Sub-saharan Africa; Swat+; Catchments; Climate Change; Climate Models; Crops; Runoff; Water Supply; 'current; Agricultural Impacts; Agricultural Productivity; Case-studies; Climate Change Impact; Crop Water Use; Crop Yield; Localised; Sub-saharan Africa; Swat+; Swat; Adaptive Management; Catchment; Climate Change; Crop Yield; Growth Rate; Soil And Water Assessment Tool; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Twenty First Century; Water Use; Kenya; Sub-saharan Africa","Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Runoff; Water supply; 'current; Agricultural impacts; Agricultural productivity; Case-studies; Climate change impact; Crop water use; Crop yield; Localised; Sub-saharan africa; SWAT+; SWAT; adaptive management; catchment; climate change; crop yield; growth rate; soil and water assessment tool; spatiotemporal analysis; twenty first century; water use; Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa","","","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Research Foundation - Flanders ( FWO ) for funding the International Coordination Action (ICA) “Open Water Network: Open Data and Software tools for water resources management” (project code G0E2621N ).","Abbaspour, Karim C., A continental-scale hydrology and water quality model for Europe: Calibration and uncertainty of a high-resolution large-scale SWAT model, Journal of Hydrology, 524, pp. 733-752, (2015); Climate Change 2022 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability, (2022); Annex II Climate System Scenario Tables Prather M G Flato P Friedlingstein C Jones J F Lamarque H Liao and P Rasch Eds in Climate Change 2013 the Physical Science Basis Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2013); undefined, (2018); Adachi, Sachiho A., An evaluation method for uncertainties in regional climate projections, Atmospheric Science Letters, 20, 1, (2019); Adhikari, Umesh, Climate change and eastern Africa: A review of impact on major crops, Food and Energy Security, 4, 2, pp. 110-132, (2015); Alemayehu, Tadesse Abitew, An improved SWAT vegetation growth module and its evaluation for four tropical ecosystems, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 21, 9, pp. 4449-4467, (2017); Allen, Leon Hartwell, Carbon dioxide and temperature effects on evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of soybean, Agronomy Journal, 95, 4, pp. 1071-1081, (2003); undefined, (1998); International Journal of Agronomy and Agricultural Research, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","03783774; 18732283","","AWMAD","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185264138"

With modern technologies, farmers can use substances like pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers at precise dosages or to identify places on a field with specific production rates. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to introduce a novel and a unique aerial image dataset of various fields acquired by UAV containing crops/weeds in the early phenophases captured in two different resolutions (2 mm and 7 mm per pixel). Secondly, the best super-resolution technique for high-resolution images, substitution with lower resolution is explored. METHODS: For data acquisition, we employed DJI Matrice 600 equipped with a full-frame Sony Alpha A7R IV285 image sensor. Data were captured at flight heights of 26 and 95 m from 4 different fields in Central Europe. In addition, we proposed a methodology focused on the selection of an appropriate super-resolution method to enhance low-resolution aerial images to obtain better accuracy of crop/weed detection. As a baseline crop/weed detector for super-resolution effect evaluation, YOLOv5 architecture was used. Next, we explored the performance of several super-resolution models (U-Net++, ESRGAN, SwinIR), and fine-tuned the best-performed one. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We present the new dataset named SPAGRI-AI: a novel unique dataset of aerial images for super-resolution experiments in smart precision agriculture. The dataset contains 27,638 aerial images (1024 × 1024 px) and additionally, it contains a subset of 2014 labeled images with 45,548 bounding boxes of 12 classes. The main purpose of the SPAGRI-AI is to provide the scientific community with real-world data to test new methods for super-resolution (SR) and crop/weed detection. During the evaluation of selected super-resolution models, the YOLOv5 model trained on high-resolution images resulted in corn mAP@0.5 of 94.48%. The YOLOv5 model trained on low-resolution images resulted in corn mAP@0.5 of only 51.43%. Nevertheless, if the low-resolution images were pre-processed using the SwinIR super-resolution method, corn mAP@0.5 of 62.36% was achieved. SIGNIFICANCE: To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the largest datasets available to the paper's publication date. Overall, the SPAGRI-AI dataset and the findings from our experiments contribute to the advancement of super-resolution techniques and crop/weed detection methods in the field of smart agriculture. By utilizing real-world data and optimizing image enhancement approaches, we paved the way for further developments in precision farming practices and applying emerging technologies in agriculture. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Crop And Weed; Deep-learning; Image Super-resolution; Smart Agriculture; Aerial Photography; Artificial Neural Network; Data Set; Detection Method; Image Resolution; Learning; Maize; Weed; Central Europe","aerial photography; artificial neural network; data set; detection method; image resolution; learning; maize; weed; Central Europe","","","Funding text 1: This document is the results of the research project funded by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic (project no.

But it is more uncertain and difficult to forecast than industrial, commercial, and residential loads. Multivariate time series prediction methods have problems such as poor refinement of weather services and difficulty in quantifying the influencing factors. Univariate time series prediction methods should be emphasized, and the characteristic information in the historical load data should be fully exploited. Therefore, this paper systematically investigates the decomposition strategy and attention-based recurrent neural network for univariate time-series multi-step prediction. The decomposition strategy is employed to generate derived variable sequences from the target sequence as inputs for the model, while the dual-stage attention mechanism is used for dynamically selecting features. A one-year real-world dataset of agricultural power loads in southern China is used for validation. The effectiveness of two different decomposition algorithms on dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DARNN) is discussed, then the proposed ensemble empirical mode decomposition and dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (EEMD-DARNN) is compared with four univariate time series prediction models and three ablation models. The proposed model is optimal in four evaluation indicators, with R2, RMSE, MAPE, and MAE of 0.970, 12.298, 0.040, and 7.335 respectively in the shortest forecast horizon (15 min), and 0.941, 17.305, 0.065 and 11.347 respectively in the longest forecast horizon (1 h). It is a significant improvement over the existing models. In conclusion, EEMD-DARNN can achieve more accurate ultra-short-term agricultural power load forecasting. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Power Load Forecasting; Attention Mechanism; Decomposition Strategy; Recurrent Neural Network; Univariate Time Series Prediction; Agriculture; Electric Power Plant Loads; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Forecasting; Time Series; Agricultural Power Load Forecasting; Attention Mechanisms; Decomposition Strategy; Dual Stage; Power Load; Power Load Forecasting; Prediction Methods; Time Series Prediction; Univariate Time Series; Univariate Time Series Prediction; Recurrent Neural Networks","Agriculture; Electric power plant loads; Empirical mode decomposition; Forecasting; Time series; Agricultural power load forecasting; Attention mechanisms; Decomposition strategy; Dual stage; Power load; Power load forecasting; Prediction methods; Time series prediction; Univariate time series; Univariate time series prediction; Recurrent neural networks","","","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 52007193 and the 2115 Talent Development Program of China Agricultural University .","Int J Power Energy Res, (2017); Chen, Qian, A novel trilinear deep residual network with self-adaptive Dropout method for short-term load forecasting, Expert Systems with Applications, 182, (2021); Chu, Xiaoquan, CDA-LSTM: an evolutionary convolution-based dual-attention LSTM for univariate time series prediction, Neural Computing and Applications, 33, 23, pp. 16113-16137, (2021); Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling, (2014); Journal of Official Statistics, (1990); Du, Shengdong, Multivariate time series forecasting via attention-based encoder–decoder framework, Neurocomputing, 388, pp. 269-279, (2020); Fu, Xueqian, Statistical machine learning model for capacitor planning considering uncertainties in photovoltaic power, Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems, 7, 1, (2022); Fu, Xueqian, Statistical Machine Learning Model for Stochastic Optimal Planning of Distribution Networks Considering a Dynamic Correlation and Dimension Reduction, IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, 11, 4, pp. 2904-2917, (2020); Fu, Xueqian, Collaborative Optimization of PV Greenhouses and Clean Energy Systems in Rural Areas, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 14, 1, pp. 642-656, (2023); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175472027"

However, an accurate estimate of net carbon (C) emissions and strategies to mitigate the abundant methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) emission from rice fields supplied with organic sources remain unclear. Here, using machine learning and a global dataset, we scaled the field findings up to worldwide rice fields to reconcile rice yields and net C emissions. An optimal organic nitrogen (N) management was developed considering total N input, type of organic N source and organic N proportion. A combination of optimal organic N management with intermittent flooding achieved a 21% reduction in net global warming potential and a 9% rise in global rice production compared with the business-as-usual scenario. Our study provides a solution for recycling organic N sources towards a more productive, carbon-neutral and sustainable rice–livestock production system on a global scale. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Water; Carbon; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Carbon; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Water; Metafor Package Version 4.4-0; Green Manure; Organic Nitrogen; Water; Carbon; Fertilizer; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Agricultural Worker; Article; Carbon Emission; Climate; Controlled Study; Cropping System; Cyanobacterium; Economic Aspect; Flooding; Geographic And Geological Parameters; Global Warming Potential; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gas; Hierarchical Clustering; Latitude; Livestock; Longitude; Machine Learning; Manure; Methane Emission; Nitrous Oxide Emission; Organic Nutrient; Paddy Field; Plant Height; Plant Yield; Precipitation; Random Forest; Recycling; Rice; Soil Acidity; Spatial Analysis; Temperature; Warming; Water Management; Agriculture; Animal; Oryza; Soil; Agriculture; Animals; Carbon; Fertilizers; Livestock; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Water","green manure; organic nitrogen; water; carbon; fertilizer; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; agricultural worker; Article; carbon emission; climate; controlled study; cropping system; cyanobacterium; economic aspect; flooding; geographic and geological parameters; global warming potential; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; hierarchical clustering; latitude; livestock; longitude; machine learning; manure; methane emission; nitrous oxide emission; organic nutrient; paddy field; plant height; plant yield; precipitation; random forest; recycling; rice; soil acidity; spatial analysis; temperature; warming; water management; agriculture; animal; Oryza; soil; Agriculture; Animals; Carbon; Fertilizers; Livestock; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Water","","water, 7732-18-5; carbon, 7440-44-0; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Carbon; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Water","This work is funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2023YFE0105000; 2023YFD1900605), National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC; grant number U20A2047), Innovation Research 2035 Pilot Plan of Southwest University (SWU-XDZD22001) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2023M733786).","Zhang, Bowen, Global manure nitrogen production and application in cropland during 1860-2014: A 5 arcmin gridded global dataset for Earth system modeling, Earth System Science Data, 9, 2, pp. 667-678, (2017); Springmann, Marco, Options for keeping the food system within environmental limits, Nature, 562, 7728, pp. 519-525, (2018); Spiegal, Sheri A., Land use change and collaborative manureshed management in New Mexico, Journal of Environmental Quality, 51, 4, pp. 602-613, (2022); Qin, Zhangcai, Animal waste use and implications to agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, Environmental Research Letters, 16, 6, (2021); Carlson, Kimberly M., Greenhouse gas emissions intensity of global croplands, Nature Climate Change, 7, 1, pp. 63-68, (2017); Yuan, Shen, Sustainable intensification for a larger global rice bowl, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Smith, Pete, How to measure, report and verify soil carbon change to realize the potential of soil carbon sequestration for atmospheric greenhouse gas removal, Global Change Biology, 26, 1, pp. 219-241, (2020); Li, Binzhe, Responses of soil organic carbon stock to animal manure application: A new global synthesis integrating the impacts of agricultural managements and environmental conditions, Global Change Biology, 27, 20, pp. 5356-5367, (2021); Liu, Chang, Effects of straw carbon input on carbon dynamics in agricultural soils: A meta-analysis, Global Change Biology, 20, 5, pp. 1366-1381, (2014); Tariq, Azeem, Early drainage mitigates methane and nitrous oxide emissions from organically amended paddy soils, Geoderma, 304, pp. 49-58, (2017)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","26621355","","","38486125","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187872826"

However, they are challenging to access for environmental monitoring, for agricultural uses, and for search and rescue applications. To enter, aerial robots need to fly through dense vegetation, where foliage can be pushed aside, but occluded branches pose critical obstacles. Therefore, we propose pixel-wise depth regression of occluded branches using three different U-Net inspired architectures. Given RGB-D input of trees with partially occluded branches, the models estimate depth values of only the wooden parts of the tree. A large photorealistic simulation dataset comprising around 44 K images of nine different tree species is generated, on which the models are trained. Extensive evaluation and analysis of the models on this dataset is shown. To improve network generalization to real-world data, different data augmentation and transformation techniques are performed. The approaches are then also successfully demonstrated on real-world data of broadleaf trees from Swiss temperate forests and a tropical Masoala Rainforest. This work showcases the previously unexplored task of frame-by-frame pixel-based occluded branch depth reconstruction to facilitate robot traversal of forest environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning For Visual Perception; Rgb-d Perception; Robotics And Automation In Agriculture And Forestry; Aerial Photography; Agricultural Robots; Antennas; Computer Vision; Crops; Deep Learning; Farms; Feature Extraction; Image Analysis; Metadata; Pixels; Timber; Vegetation; Decoding; Deep Learning For Visual Perception; Features Extraction; Forest Environments; Image Color Analysis; Real-world; Rgb-d Perception; Robotic And Automation In Agriculture And Forestry; Task Analysis; Visual Perception; Forestry","Aerial photography; Agricultural robots; Antennas; Computer vision; Crops; Deep learning; Farms; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Metadata; Pixels; Timber; Vegetation; Decoding; Deep learning for visual perception; Features extraction; Forest environments; Image color analysis; Real-world; RGB-D perception; Robotic and automation in agriculture and forestry; Task analysis; Visual perception; Forestry","","","","Supplementary Materials Learning Occluded Branch Depth Maps in Forest Environments Using Rgb D Images, (2023); State of the Worlds Forests 2020 Forests Biodiversity and People, (2025); Pillay, Rajeev, Tropical forests are home to over half of the world’s vertebrate species, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 20, 1, pp. 10-15, (2022); Brockerhoff, Eckehard G., Forest biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services, Biodiversity and Conservation, 26, 13, pp. 3005-3035, (2017); Zomer, Robert J., Global Tree Cover and Biomass Carbon on Agricultural Land: The contribution of agroforestry to global and national carbon budgets, Scientific Reports, 6, (2016); Zhou, Xin, Swarm of micro flying robots in the wild, Science Robotics, 7, 66, (2022); Liu, Xu, Large-Scale Autonomous Flight with Real-Time Semantic SLAM under Dense Forest Canopy, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 7, 2, pp. 5512-5519, (2022); Charron, Guillaume, The Deleaves: A UAV device for efficient tree canopy sampling, Journal of Unmanned Vehicle Systems, 8, 3, pp. 245-264, (2020); Adv Intell Syst, (2022); Aucone, Emanuele, Drone-assisted collection of environmental DNA from tree branches for biodiversity monitoring, Science Robotics, 8, 74, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","23773766","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182945321"

Studying crop pollination from a network approach allows identification of target pollinators for conservation and management, and gaps in our knowledge. Solanaceae represents the third highest ranked family based on economic value, and its production is highly improved by animal pollination. This study aimed to integrate global data on solanaceous crop pollination and analyse the interaction patterns using a meta-network approach. Our questions were: (i) how are interactions structured and what are the structuring roles of species; and (ii) what are the main gaps in our knowledge? Data were obtained through a systematic review of the main scientific databases. The network structure was described using connectivity and modularity calculations, and the role of species using centrality metrics. The 251 pollinator species reported were in seven orders, mainly Hymenoptera (84.9%). The generalists Bombus and Apis species were the most common pollinators. The meta-network was modular, and all modules mostly included bees. Most species were peripherals, around 12% were connectors, and there were no module hubs. Apis mellifera was the only network hub (supergeneralist). The most important pollinators are the most managed pollinators worldwide; however, many native species play a role in structuring the meta-network. Main gaps include species of importance to pepper pollination, lack of species-specific identification, and the need for more robust experimental studies evaluating the pollination efficiency of native, manageable bees. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bees; Crop Pollination; Ecological Network; Ecosystem Services; Vegetables; Connectivity; Ecosystem Service; Plant-pollinator Interaction; Pollination; Vegetable; Animal; Bee; Crop; Solanaceae; Species Difference; Animals; Bees; Crops, Agricultural; Pollination; Species Specificity","connectivity; ecosystem service; plant-pollinator interaction; pollination; vegetable; animal; bee; crop; Solanaceae; species difference; Animals; Bees; Crops, Agricultural; Pollination; Species Specificity","","","The authors thank the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel of Brazil for the research grant (88887.497013/2020‐00), the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development for research grants (141462/2021‐3; 428303/2018‐8 and 309668/2018‐2), and the Graduate Program in Biodiversity at the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco.","Aminatun, Tien, The effect of pollinator insect visitation on flower development and productivity of chilli plant, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1387, 1, (2019); Solanaceae Crop by Products as Renewable Sources of Bioactive Phenolic Extracts, (2022); Antonini, Yasmine, Richness and behavior of insect visitors of Stachytarpheta glabra Cham.

Two water footprint methods, the WFN-based blue water footprint impact index (WFII<inf>blue</inf>) and the Available WAter REmaining (AWARE) water scarcity footprint (WF<inf>AWARE</inf>), were evaluated using different sets of global or local data sources, different rates of environmental flow requirements, and the regional or catchment scale of the analysis. A majority (~99%) of the consumptive water footprint of a unit of pastoral dairy milk production (L/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk) was quantified as being associated with green and blue water consumption via evapotranspiration for pasture and feed used at the studied dairy farms. The quantified WFII<inf>blue</inf> (-) and WF<inf>AWARE</inf> (m3 world eq./kg of FPCM) indices ranked in a similar order (from lowest to highest) regarding the water scarcity footprint impact associated with pastoral dairy milk production across the study regions and catchments. However, use of the global or local data sets significantly affected the quantification and comparative rankings of the WFII<inf>blue</inf> and WF<inf>AWARE</inf> values. Compared to the local data sets, using the global data sets resulted in significant under- or overestimation of the WFII<inf>blue</inf> and WF<inf>AWARE</inf> values across the study regions and catchments.

Previous efforts to explain this variation have focused exclusively on the landscape features and management regimes of agricultural systems, neglecting the potentially critical role of ecological filtering in shaping deforestation tolerance of extant species assemblages at large geographical scales via selection for functional traits. Here we provide a large-scale test of this role using a global database of species abundance ratios between matched agricultural and native forest sites that comprises 71 avian assemblages reported in 44 primary studies, and a companion database of 10 functional traits for all 2,647 species involved. Using meta-analytic, phylogenetic and multivariate methods, we show that beyond agricultural features, filtering by the extent of natural environmental variability and the severity of historical anthropogenic deforestation shapes the varying deforestation impacts across species assemblages. For assemblages under greater environmental variability—proxied by drier and more seasonal climates under a greater disturbance regime—and longer deforestation histories, filtering has attenuated the negative impacts of current deforestation by selecting for functional traits linked to stronger deforestation tolerance. Our study provides a previously largely missing piece of knowledge in understanding and managing the biodiversity consequences of deforestation by agricultural deforestation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Biodiversity; Bird; Climate; Controlled Study; Data Base; Deforestation; Filtration; Forest; Nonhuman; Population Abundance","article; biodiversity; bird; climate; controlled study; data base; deforestation; filtration; forest; nonhuman; population abundance","","","We thank all co-authors of the primary studies that enabled the generation of original data included in this study, Y.

In the district of Boane, located a few kilometres downstream of the Pequenos Libombos dam, the flood destroyed many food crops as well as two bridges linking the district to Maputo, thus affecting the food security of the population. These events are quite frequent in this region, making the delineation of improved flood hazard maps and the development of new flood risk management plans necessary. We reproduce this flood event with a high-resolution integrated hydrologic-hydraulic model fed with freely available global data sources, using a methodology that can be easily reproduced in other data-scarce regions. The model results are validated with observed estimations of the inflow to the Pequenos Libombos reservoir, with water marks left by the flood in the district of Boane, and with a Sentinel-1 image taken during the recession of the flood. We analyse the effect of the Pequenos Libombos reservoir on the flood hazard, which was subject to debate among the affected population and in the media. The results obtained show that integrated hydrologic-hydraulic models based on two-dimensional shallow-water equations, combined with global databases, are currently able to reasonably reproduce the extent and peak discharge of extreme flood events in data-scarce basins and are therefore very useful tools for the development of flood management plans in these regions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catchment; Data Set; Estimation Method; Flooding; Food Security; Hydraulic Property; Image Analysis; Integrated Approach; Two-dimensional Modeling; Maputo [mozambique]; Mozambique","catchment; data set; estimation method; flooding; food security; hydraulic property; image analysis; integrated approach; two-dimensional modeling; Maputo [Mozambique]; Mozambique","","","","Copernicus Dem Global and European Digital Elevation Model Cop Dem; Bayburt, Serdar, Geometric accuracy analysis of worlddem in relation to AW3D30, srtm and aster GDEM2, International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives, 42, 1W1, pp. 211-217, (2017); Bennett, Neil D., Characterising performance of environmental models, Environmental Modelling and Software, 40, pp. 1-20, (2013); Bermúdez, María, A rapid flood inundation model for hazard mapping based on least squares support vector machine regression, Journal of Flood Risk Management, 12, S1, (2019); Bladé Castellet, Ernest, Iber -River modelling simulation tool, Revista Internacional de Metodos Numericos para Calculo y Diseno en Ingenieria, 30, 1, pp. 1-10, (2014); Caviedes-Voullième, Daniel, SERGHEI (SERGHEI-SWE) v1.0: A performance-portable high-performance parallel-computing shallow-water solver for hydrology and environmental hydraulics, Geoscientific Model Development, 16, 3, pp. 977-1008, (2023); Cea, Luis, A simple and efficient unstructured finite volume scheme for solving the shallow water equations in overland flow applications, Water Resources Research, 51, 7, pp. 5464-5486, (2015); Cea, Luis, Overland flow computations in urban and industrial catchments from direct precipitation data using a two-dimensional shallow water model, Water Science and Technology, 62, 9, pp. 1998-2008, (2010); Cea, Luis, Estimation of flood-exposed population in data-scarce regions combining satellite imagery and high resolution hydrological-hydraulic modelling: A case study in the Licungo basin (Mozambique), Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, 44, (2022); Copernicus and ESA the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem Copernicus and ESA Data Set, (2023)","","Copernicus Publications","","","","","","15618633; 16849981","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184066215"

Climate change is an important issue because its causing imbalance in the environment and affects the lives of all flora and fauna. The climate change is due to many factors, but the major factor is the human activities which are leading to global warming over the past decades. Numerous studies consider analysis of continental or global data, providing the overall insights in climatic changes continentally or globally respectively. The approach in this paper considers regional analysis to provide better insights to the local people needs so they get adapted to the changes that are taking place. This provides a warning to the people to take preventive and precautionary measures. The dataset of Karnataka region from 1951 to 2020 is used to study the regional climate change pattern. The main objective of the paper is to analyze the climate change and extending in the future. The results show that there is a gradual increase of average mean surface air temperature and gradual decrease of the precipitation over each decade between the years 1951 to 2020. The trend line extending to 2040 by analyzing the historical data gives insights about the climate change in the near future. Understanding the historical data and the future predictions are very important to the policy makers, people and researchers so that effective planning can be done for adapting and decreasing the climate change patterns. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Environment Impact; Regional Climate Trends; Miocene; Change Patterns; Climate Trends; Environment Impact; Historical Data; Karnataka; Major Factors; Regional Climate; Regional Climate Trend; Simple++; Weather Parameters","Miocene; Change patterns; Climate trends; Environment impact; Historical data; Karnataka; Major factors; Regional climate; Regional climate trend; Simple++; Weather parameters","","","","Na Tional Buildings Organisation, (2011); Yamarthi, Narasimha Rao, Providing enhanced security in IoT based smart weather system, Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 18, 1, pp. 9-15, (2019); Pratapa Raju, M.

Software-defined networking (SDN) emerges as a solution to this dilemma, offering enhanced flexibility and scalability. However, the security vulnerabilities inherent in SDN-based Internet of Things (IoT) networks, particularly in critical sectors like agriculture, present significant concerns. During a drought, critical infrastructures, such as water distribution systems in agricultural environments, could be targeted by DDoS attacks, further exacerbating the crisis. Additionally, these attacks could serve as distractions, diverting the focus of authorities and farmers away from necessary measures to manage the drought. Moreover, IoT devices used for monitoring meteorological conditions during the drought could also be compromised and exploited in DDoS attacks. To address this vulnerability, a proposed mechanism combines machine learning (ML) with SDN to detect and mitigate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in agricultural environments. This approach operates in three phases: building a robust detection model using ML techniques, integrating this model into the SDN controller for real-time anomaly detection, and implementing mitigation strategies to prevent further damage in case of an attack.

Advances in field management through robotic intervention, monitoring of crops by autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) supporting breeding of novel and more resilient crop varieties can help to address these challenges. The analysis of plant traits is called phenotyping and is an essential activity in plant breeding; it however involves a great amount of manual labor. With this paper, we provide means to better tackle the problems of instance segmentation to support robotic intervention and automatic fine-grained, organ-level geometric analysis needed for precision phenotyping. As the availability of real-world data in this domain is relatively scarce, we provide a novel dataset that was acquired using UAVs capturing high-resolution images of real breeding trials containing 48 plant varieties and therefore covering a relevant morphological and appearance spectrum. This enables the development of approaches for instance segmentation and autonomous phenotyping that generalize well to different plant varieties. Based on overlapping high-resolution images taken from multiple viewing angles, we provide photogrammetric dense point clouds and provide detailed and accurate point-wise labels for plants, leaves, and salient points as the tip and the base in 3D. Additionally, we include measurements of phenotypic traits performed by experts from the German Federal Plant Variety Office on the real plants, allowing the evaluation of new approaches not only on segmentation and keypoint detection but also directly on actual traits. The provided labeled point clouds enable finegrained plant analysis and support further progress in the development of automatic phenotyping approaches, but also enable further research in surface reconstruction, point cloud completion, and semantic interpretation of point clouds. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fertilizers; Labeled Data; Robots; Semantic Segmentation; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uav); Agricultural Productions; Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; Cloud-based; Field Conditions; Field Management; High-resolution Images; Impact On The Environment; In-field; Phenotyping; Point-clouds; Sugar Beets","Fertilizers; Labeled data; Robots; Semantic Segmentation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agricultural productions; Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles; Cloud-based; Field conditions; Field management; High-resolution images; Impact on the environment; In-field; Phenotyping; Point-clouds; Sugar beets","","","This work has partially been funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy, EXC-2070 - 390732324 - PhenoRob, under STA 1051/5-1 within the FOR 5351 (AID4Crops), and by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany via the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) under the innovation support programme under funding no 28DK108B20 (RegisTer).","Armeni, Iro, 3D semantic parsing of large-scale indoor spaces, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 1534-1543, (2016); Behley, Jens, SemanticKITTI: A dataset for semantic scene understanding of LiDAR sequences, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 9296-9306, (2019); Chang, Mingfang, Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019-June, pp. 8740-8749, (2019); Cvppp Eccv 2020 Workshop on Computer Vision Problems in Plant Phenotyping, (2021); Chebrolu, Nived, Agricultural robot dataset for plant classification, localization and mapping on sugar beet fields, International Journal of Robotics Research, 36, 10, pp. 1045-1052, (2017); Cordts, Marius, The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 3213-3223, (2016); Dai, Angela, ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017-January, pp. 2432-2443, (2017); Diacono, Mariangela, Long-term effects of organic amendments on soil fertility.

They provide responses to problems that old metaheuristics were unable to respond to, with a level of precision allowing the industrialization of the proposed solutions when applied to detection problems in dense scene analysis in agricultural challenges. Hence, in the era of post-pandemic awareness towards staple crop security, one of the most challenging problems studied in computer vision for agriculture is the wheat head counting in field conditions with spike and spikelet occlusions and overlaps. The final target is to offer a solid key informational input between many necessary others, to make farmers, breeders and agronomists able to estimate the wheat head density and supervise their emergence and growth over time and space allowing them to interact on time in the process and to have an idea about yield estimations. To address these issues using new deep learning advances, this paper proposes the implementation of YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models to the GHWD-2021, a global wheat head dataset compiled from different continents to guarantee phenotypes diversity, then we test the robustness of the results on a self compiled Tunisian wheat dataset.

To overcome this problem we are considering factors that affect the crop such as soil quality, rainfall, temperature, pH etc.. The system will take into these factors such as soil type, weather conditions, and crop variety to provide accurate yield predictions. Fuzzy logic will be used to handle the uncertainties and imprecise data associated with agricultural systems. The project will leverage machine learning algorithms and statistical models to build a robust prediction engine and evaluate its performance against traditional approaches. The system will be tested on real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving crop yield prediction accuracy.

Accurate yield estimations ensure an adequate food supply, contributing to food security and reducing the risk of food shortages. They also enable market planning and price setting. Machine learning is well known as one of the most advanced statistical methods for predicting crop yields. This paper provides extensive experiment results of machine-learning models on maize production. Thirteen basic supervised learning algorithms classified into classic and ensemble learning are compared using three datasets of different sizes and from various sources (Kaggle, Zenodo). These datasets are from three main origins: experimentation, specifically covering crop data with 240 observations; predictions on crop yield from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) and World Data Bank with 4,121 observations; and historical data from China with 975 observations. The metrics used to evaluate the models are the coefficient of determination, the mean absolute error, the root mean square error, and the explained variance score. Moreover, permutation importance is used on the best models to identify the most relevant predictors for the models according to the data. The results show that extremely randomized trees (ERT) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) are more suitable for predicting maize yield with a coefficient of determination between 0.75 and 0.96 and 0.73 and 0.96, respectively. With the other metrics, the ERT model shows a low performance. Its training time varies between 2,547 and 7,814 seconds as obtained from a computer with characteristics of HP core i5, CPU @ 1.00 GHz, 1.9 GHz, and 8 GB RAM under 134 Windows 10. ERT and XGBoost are best suited to these databases of varying dimensions, making them perfect for predicting maize yield and streamlining decision-making processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classic Machine Learning; Ensemble Learning; Maize; Secondary Data; Yield Prediction","","","","This work was supported by:-German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),-Scholarship Program in Artificial Intelligence for Development (AI4D) Africa, funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the Swedish International Cooperation Agency (SIDA), and managed by the African Centre for Technology Studies and Development (ACTS).","Shiferaw, Bekele, Crops that feed the world 6.

In this paper, we propose a system that uses a 3D model of plants along crop rows to enable a robotic platform to localize itself even in the presence of heavy changes and deforming the model to adapt the scene description to the new measurements. In particular, we focus on consumer RGB-D cameras due to their cost-effectiveness and ease of deployment on real platforms. Our approach exploits modern deep-learning-based feature descriptors and geometric information to obtain matches between 3D points corresponding to temporally distant sessions. We then use the associations in a non-rigid registration pipeline to obtain the final result, an updated representation of the 3D model that reflects plant changes. Using a standard RGB-D sensor, we validate our approach on a real-world dataset recorded in a glasshouse. We obtain accurate 4D models of the plants and track the plant traits' evolution over time.

In many cases, a DSS that is exclusively focused on data-driven methodologies might be highly influenced by data sources if these data resources do not provide any sense of intended conclusion. As a result, on-farm experiment inputs may result in incorrect site-specific crop management in the end. Since data is an essential element of DSS, irregular patterns such as outliers in spatial data that can change the nature of expected outcomes must be avoided during data-driven manipulations. Many of the approaches developed to detect outliers were not designed to deal with masking and swamping effects. With this consideration, the work presented here uses two iterative techniques to locate and remove spatial outliers based on their neighbourhood relationship. As a result of this technique, the masking and swamping effects are reduced. The methods we use are iterative, implying that each iteration discovers and eliminates the expected number of outlying observations. R-Studio is used to demonstrate the use of iterative approaches. The efficacy of both iterative procedures was analysed and compared using one of the current graphical approaches, such as the semivariogram. The research specifically looks at how well these strategies perform on a real-world dataset incorporating spatial observations. The statistical iterative techniques outperformed the graphical approach, according to the findings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision Support System (dss); Iterative-r; Iterative-z; Masking And Swamping Effects; Precision Agriculture (pa); Site-specific Crop Management (sscm); Spatial Autocorrelation; Spatial Neighborhood; Spatial Outliers; Variogram; Precision Agriculture; Decision Support System; Decision Supports; Iterative-r; Iterative-z; Masking And Swamping Effect; Site-specific Crop Management; Spatial Autocorrelations; Spatial Neighborhoods; Spatial Outlier; Support Systems; Varogram; Data Consistency","Precision agriculture; Decision support system; Decision supports; Iterative-R; Iterative-Z; Masking and swamping effect; Site-specific crop management; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial neighborhoods; Spatial outlier; Support systems; Varogram; Data consistency","","","This work was supported by the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal.","Geostats 2008 Proceedings of the Eighth International Geostatistics Congress, (2008); Statistical Decisions in Optimizing Grain Yield, (2004); Proceedings of the First Meeting of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics, (2013); Chen, Dechang, On detecting spatial outliers, GeoInformatica, 12, 4, pp. 455-475, (2008); Chang-Tien, Lu, Algorithms for spatial outlier detection, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM, pp. 597-600, (2003); Serfling, Robert J., General foundations for studying masking and swamping robustness of outlier identifiers, Statistical Methodology, 20, pp. 79-90, (2014); Statistical Geocomputing Spatial Outlier Detection in Precision Agriculture, (2011); Babu, Satish, A software model for precision agriculture for small and marginal farmers, pp. 352-355, (2013); Geostatistical Applications for Precision Agriculture, (2010); Bosman, Hedde H.W.J., Spatial anomaly detection in sensor networks using neighborhood information, Information Fusion, 33, pp. 41-56, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209747153"

However, gathering high-quality and representative ground-truth data for training supervised machine learners is extremely challenging in emerging use cases, as it is cost-inefficient and user-dependent. Thus, building (deep) machine learning models from very few training samples is of paramount practical importance. To tackle this issue, we propose a semi-supervised learning pipeline for elaborating deep learning models for multi-class hyperspectral image classification, while benefiting from the available unlabeled samples, leveraging pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization. Although our technique is model-agnostic, we exploit a deep residual network for classifying hyperspectral images according to the magnesium content in the imaged soil.

We propose a technique to assess the clean optical coverage of a region, expressed by a SITS and calculated with the S2-based SCL data.

Wind power, as a renewable energy source, can replace non-renewable energy sources to reduce energy costs and improve the sustainability of agricultural. However, the inherent intermittency, randomness, and volatility within weather conditions and wind speed presents a substantial challenge in accurately predicting wind power generation. This work proposes a novel YJQR-LSTM algorithm that leverages Yeo-Johnson quantile regression (YJQR) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for nonparametric probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation via the Intelligent Internet of Things. First, an improved YJQR model based on the YJ transformation is designed to obtain a more precise characterization of wind uncertainty, providing a more flexible probability density function for wind power generation. Then, utilizing the unique structure of the LSTM network to learn the parameters of the YJQR model, temporal features can be extracted from time series data. To mitigate the impact of outliers in the raw data on accuracy and improve computational efficiency, a novel logarithmic likelihood function is developed as the loss function utilized in the training phase. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated using a real-world dataset from five wind farms from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition. Numerical results demonstrate that the algorithm provides more accurate wind power prediction results in complex wind power data environments, which is important for making full use of wind energy and thus reducing the consumption of non-renewable energy in agriculture. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture Wind; Intelligent Internet Of Things; Long Short-term Memory; Probabilistic Forecasting; Yeo-johnson Quantile Regression","","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62373158, 62273053; in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province under Grant 2022CFB041; in part by the Wuhan Science and Technology Innovation Special Project under Grant 2022010801020099; in part by the Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet of Things and Networked Control under Grant 2020FF02; in part by the Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing under Grant Scip202211; in part by the State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmission for Advanced Equipment under Grant SKLMT-MSKFKT-202317; in part by the Open Research Project of the State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, China (Grant No. ICT2024B22); in part by the Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Control and Intelligent Automation for Complex Systems under Grant ACIA2022001; and in part by the 111 Project under Grant B17040.

This study proposes a new method to address the problem with the help of deep learning for the purpose of effectively identifying drought resistance in chili plants and focus on the detail analysis of plant health. We intend to use deep learning frameworks to design Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to upscale the low-resolution thermal images of chili plants to their high-resolution images. CWSI is computed based on the generated images, further employed to evaluate drought stress in chili plants. A real-world dataset of chili plants under various water stress circumstances will be gathered in order to accomplish this. The Crop Water Stress Index(CWSI) can be computed using the high-resolution thermal images generated via the CNN models. Compared to conventional visual inspection techniques, CWSI offers a more objective and accurate assessment by providing a quantitative measure of a plant's water stress level. Our method seeks to greatly increase the accuracy of drought resistance evaluation in chili plants by enhancing the integrity and visual clarity of low-resolution thermal images. Improved accuracy and effectiveness in agricultural monitoring and resource management strategies will follow from this. Ultimately, it could empower farmers to make data-driven decisions about irrigation techniques, maximizing water use effectiveness and guaranteeing the productivity and long-term health of their chili crops. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cnn; Cwsi; Espcn; Rdn; Srcnn; Convolutional Neural Network; Crop Water Stress Indices; Drought Resistance; Drought Stress; Espcn; Lower Resolution; Neural Network Model; Rdn; Srcnn; Thermal Images","Convolutional neural network; Crop water stress indices; Drought resistance; Drought stress; ESPCN; Lower resolution; Neural network model; RDN; SRCNN; Thermal images","","","","Dong, Chao, Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 38, 2, pp. 295-307, (2016); Li, Huan, Image Super-Resolution Algorithm Based on RRDB Model, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 156260-156273, (2021); Zhou, Zheng, Assessment for crop water stress with infrared thermal imagery in precision agriculture: A review and future prospects for deep learning applications, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 182, (2021); International Workshop on Computer Modeling and Intelligent Systems, (2023); Jones, Hamlyn G., Thermal infrared imaging of crop canopies for the remote diagnosis and quantification of plant responses to water stress in the field, Functional Plant Biology, 36, 11, pp. 978-989, (2009); Cheng, Minghan, Evaluation of UAV-based drought indices for crop water conditions monitoring: A case study of summer maize, Agricultural Water Management, 287, (2023); Martynenko, A.

Therefore, over the last years, several methods based on computer vision were proposed to automate this task, by directly counting the fruits on trees using a video camera. However, existing works and methods usually assume ideal conditions, and may fail under more challenging scenarios with unconstrained camera motion and intermittent occlusions of fruits. Here we show that combining Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with a bipartite graph matching has the potential to address those challenges. We found that our approach applied to real-world datasets, with unconstrained camera motion and low frame rates, outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to multiple intermittent occlusions under challenging conditions, and thus suitable to be used in diverse real-world scenarios in orchards, either with a camera operated by hand or mounted on an agricultural vehicle. Although not shown here, we believe that the proposed method can also be applied to other object tracking problems besides counting fruits, under similar settings - i.e. static objects and a freely moving camera. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fruit Counting; Intermittent Occlusions; Multi-object Tracking; Precision Agriculture; Yield Estimation; Fruits; Orchards; Camera Motions; Condition; Fruit Counting; Fruit Yield; Intermittent Occlusion; Low Frame Rates; Multi-object Tracking; Precision Agriculture; Structure From Motion; Yield Estimation","Fruits; Orchards; Camera motions; Condition; Fruit counting; Fruit yield; Intermittent occlusion; Low frame rates; Multi-object tracking; Precision Agriculture; Structure from motion; Yield estimation","","","","Sort; Bewley, Alex, Simple online and realtime tracking, Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP, 2016-August, pp. 3464-3468, (2016); Yolov4 Optimal Speed and Accuracy of Object Detection, (2020); Flownet Learning Optical Flow with Convolutional Networks, (2015); Blender Org Home of the Blender Project Free and Open 3D Creation Software; Amiga Fruit Counting; Gene-Mola, Jordi, Fruit detection and 3D location using instance segmentation neural networks and structure-from-motion photogrammetry, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 169, (2020); Gongal, Aleana, Apple crop-load estimation with over-the-row machine vision system, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 120, pp. 26-35, (2016); He, Leilei, Fruit yield prediction and estimation in orchards: A state-of-the-art comprehensive review for both direct and indirect methods, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 195, (2022); Häni, Nicolai, A comparative study of fruit detection and counting methods for yield mapping in apple orchards, Journal of Field Robotics, 37, 2, pp. 263-282, (2020)","","IEEE Computer Society","","2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, CVPRW 2024","","Seattle; WA","202970","21607516; 21607508","9781479943098; 9781457705298; 9781665448994; 9781538607336; 9798350302493; 9780769549903; 9781665487399; 9781467367592; 9781728125060; 9781728193601","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206455660"

A., Adaptation Physiology Group, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, Netherlands","Laying hen farmers are expected to move towards an extended flock duration of 90 to 100 weeks as response to the increased global demand for food. Between-flock variability in the egg production curve is high, especially with layers in non-cage housing systems, due to environmental stressors, diseases and welfare issues. Lengthening the production period emphasizes the need to detect health and welfare issues early to prevent long-term effects on egg production and thereby retain profitable revenues. Current solutions for anomaly detection rely on comparing egg production data to inflexible, generic reference curves or on machine learning models with low confidence anomaly detection due to absence of expert feedback and model adaptability. The objective of this study is to develop an expert-in-the-loop algorithm for early problem detection and flock-specific prediction of egg production in layers. To identify anomalies in the egg production curve, the model compares daily acquired production data against an expert-defined adaptive reference trajectory. The model employs a one-class support vector machines that is continuously enhanced using feedback from the expert in case of low confidence anomalies. The proposed algorithm is trained using synthetic datasets and tested on real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed algorithm has high anomaly detection accuracy (96%) with an F1 score of 0.93. Ultimately, the proposed algorithm will facilitate predictive maintenance of egg production, thereby allowing for personalized support in decision-making. In the future, the algorithm could be adapted to detect anomalies in other age-dependent production parameters. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Anomaly Detection; Dynamic Time Warping; Egg Production Curve; Expert-in-the-loop; Flock-specific Modelling; Incremental One-class Smv; Fertilizers; Precision Agriculture; Support Vector Machines; Adaptive Anomaly Detection; Anomaly Detection; Dynamic Time Warping; Egg Production; Egg Production Curve; Expert-in-the-loop; Flock-specific Modeling; Incremental One-class Smv; Loop Algorithms; Production Curve; Predictive Maintenance","Fertilizers; Precision agriculture; Support vector machines; Adaptive anomaly detection; Anomaly detection; Dynamic time warping; Egg production; Egg production curve; Expert-in-the-loop; Flock-specific modeling; Incremental one-class SMV; Loop algorithms; Production curve; Predictive maintenance","","","","Aach, John Dennis, Aligning gene expression time series with time warping algorithms, Bioinformatics, 17, 6, pp. 495-508, (2001); Berckmans, Daniel, General introduction to precision livestock farming, Animal Frontiers, 7, 1, pp. 6-11, (2017); Neural Computation, (1995); Bumanis, Nikolajs, Hen Egg Production Forecasting: Capabilities of Machine Learning Models in Scenarios with Limited Data Sets, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 13, 13, (2023); Carletto, Calogero, Better data, higher impact: Improving agricultural data systems for societal change, European Review of Agricultural Economics, 48, 4, pp. 719-740, (2021); undefined, (2023); Grossman, Michael, A model for persistency of egg production, Poultry Science, 79, 12, pp. 1715-1724, (2000); Iwana, Brian Kenji, An empirical survey of data augmentation for time series classification with neural networks, PLOS ONE, 16, 7 July, (2021); Keogh, Eamonn J., Exact indexing of dynamic time warping, Knowledge and Information Systems, 7, 3, pp. 358-386, (2005); Kloska, Matej, Expert enhanced dynamic time warping based anomaly detection, Expert Systems with Applications, 225, (2023)","Berckmans, D.; Tassinari, P.; Torreggiani, D.","European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming","Boehringer Ingelheim; et al.; Granarolo; Granlatte; MSD Animal Health; Parmigiano Reggiano","11th European Conference on Precision Livestock Farming","","Bologna","202416","","9791221067361","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204952917"

Traditional methodologies such as the Canny-Watershed (CW) algorithm require expert tuning of parameters for optimal results. This paper introduces an innovative approach for crop field segmentation in high-resolution satellite images, leveraging the use of multi-temporal Canny edge detection to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully automate the segmentation process. The Canny filter, applied to Sentinel-2 multi-temporal data, provides refined input for training ResUnet models, facilitating the generation of a generalized training dataset. ResUnet allows the model to learn complex features from diverse data, encapsulating seasonal changes. The dataset was specifically designed to enable the model to make accurate predictions from a single image, significantly outperforming traditional Canny filter predictions. In addition, the ResUnet may be applied to multiple images, generating output masks that, when overlayed, produce better results with respect to the multi-temporal Canny approach, demonstrating superior ability in recognizing real field boundaries while reducing false detections.To enhance generalizability, ResUnet is trained on a varied global dataset capturing a wide range of agricultural conditions and seasonal variations. This generalized model is tested across different regions and seasons, and preliminary results indicate that the proposed approach offers operational efficiency and accuracy in automating crop field segmentation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Canny Edge Detection; Convolutional Neural Networks (cnns); Crop-field Segmentation; Deep-learning; Resunet; Sentinel-2; U-net; Watershed","","","","This research was carried out within the framework of the Afri4CAst project, funded by the European Space Agency in the framework of the EO for Africa Explorers - EXPRO+ programme.","Watkins, Barry, Automating field boundary delineation with multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 167, (2019); Watkins, Barry, A comparison of object-based image analysis approaches for field boundary delineation using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 158, pp. 294-302, (2019); Preprints, (2020); Saquella, Simone, A Cross-Correlation Phenology-Based Crop Fields Classification Using Sentinel-2 Time-Series, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2022-July, pp. 5660-5663, (2022); Zhang, Huanxue, Automated delineation of agricultural field boundaries from Sentinel-2 images using recurrent residual U-Net, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 105, (2021); Zhang, Zhengxin, Road Extraction by Deep Residual U-Net, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 15, 5, pp. 749-753, (2018); Diakogiannis, Foivos I., ResUNet-a: A deep learning framework for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed data, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 162, pp. 94-114, (2020); Ronneberger, Olaf, U-net: Convolutional networks for biomedical image segmentation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9351, pp. 234-241, (2015); Alom, Md Zahangir, Recurrent residual U-Net for medical image segmentation, Journal of Medical Imaging, 6, 1, (2019); Adam A Method for Stochastic Optimization, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS)","2024 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS 2024","","Athens","202443","21537003; 21536996","1424412129; 0780312406; 9780780390508; 9798350320107; 9781728163741; 9781424495658; 9781665427920; 9781479911141; 9781479957750; 9781479979295","IGRSE","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204882189"

Deep learning techniques, have demonstrated promising results in correctly identifying and classifying plant pests and diseases. However, the accuracy of these models heavily relies on the quality and size of the training dataset. Gathering a large and diverse dataset of plant pests and diseases can be challenging due to the variation in the appearance of diseased plants and the high cost of data collection. To tackle this issue, a web portal has been developed to gather datasets of plant pests and diseases, making it simpler for researchers to contribute data and enhance the accuracy of these models. In addition, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used to expand the current datasets by creating synthetic images that closely resemble real-world data. This has resulted in improved accuracy and robustness of CNN and YOLO models in identifying and classifying plant pests and diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cnn; Data Augmentation; Data Collection; Gans; Image Classification; Image Processing; Machine Learning; Pests’ Detection; Plant Diseases; Web Portal; Yolo; Agriculture; Animals; Data Acquisition; Generative Adversarial Networks; Image Classification; Large Datasets; Learning Systems; Losses; Portals; Agricultural Sustainability; Data Augmentation; Data Collection; Images Classification; Images Processing; Machine-learning; Pest’ Detection; Plant Disease; Plant Pests; Yolo; Deep Learning","Agriculture; Animals; Data acquisition; Generative adversarial networks; Image classification; Large datasets; Learning systems; Losses; Portals; Agricultural sustainability; Data augmentation; Data collection; Images classification; Images processing; Machine-learning; Pest’ detection; Plant disease; Plant pests; YOLO; Deep learning","","","This work was partially funded by the Maroun Semaan Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, the University Research Board and the AI, DS and Computing Hub at the American University of Beirut.","International Journal of Recent Research Aspects, (2018); Front Plant Sci, (2022); Lebanon Second Report on the State of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, (2015); Creswell, Antonia, Generative Adversarial Networks: An Overview, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 35, 1, pp. 53-65, (2018); Agricultural Sector Review in Lebanon FAO Agricultural Development Economics Technical Study no 12, (2021); Deng, Jia, ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database, pp. 248-255, (2009); Gandhi, Rutu, Plant disease detection using CNNs and GANs as an augmentative approach, pp. 1-5, (2018); Ge, Chenjie, Enlarged Training Dataset by Pairwise GANs for Molecular-Based Brain Tumor Classification, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 22560-22570, (2020); Hamadé, Kanj, Contrasting Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches to Rural Development Analysis: The Case of Agricultural Intensification in Lebanon, Journal of Agricultural Economics, 66, 2, pp. 492-518, (2015); Jiang, Peiyuan, A Review of Yolo Algorithm Developments, Procedia Computer Science, 199, pp. 1066-1073, (2021)","Maglogiannis, I.; Iliadis, L.; Karydis, I.; Papaleonidas, A.; Chochliouros, I.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","13th Mining Humanistic Data Workshop, MHDW 2024, 9th Workshop on 5G-Putting Intelligence to the Network Edge, 5G-PINE 2024 and 1st Workshop on AI in Applications for Achieving the Green Deal Targets, AI4GD 2024 held as parallel events of the IFIP WG 12.5 International Workshops on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations, AIAI 2024","","Corfu","314459","1868422X; 18684238","9783032007766; 9783031962301; 9783031949234; 9783031971143; 9783031962387; 9783031965210; 9780387291215; 9783319900223; 9783319162737; 1402080697","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199164630"

More significantly, this is a crucial component of the potential Smart Agriculture (SA) system as soil moisture needs to be predicted in real time and linked to the irrigation management system to save water and energy use in agriculture. Various techniques and models have been used to forecast soil moisture. In this study, we looked at the available approaches and opted for machine learning due to the accuracy of its models. Real-world data from a smart farm prototype is used to train and validate the suggested models: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). These models were then used to predict data related to soil moisture value. Even though our model's prediction accuracy was modest because of the small dataset size, we highly recommend that researchers use it as a blueprint for real-world smart agriculture testbeds and look into machine learning as a promising venue for soil moisture prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Iot; Lstm; Machine Learning; Smart Agriculture (sa); Svr","","","","This work is sponsored by US-NAS/USAID under the PEER Cycle 5 project grant# 5-398, entitled \u201CTowards Smart Microgrid: Renewable Energy Integration into Smart Buildings``.","A Dissertation Submitted to the Graduate Faculty of Auburn University in Partial Fulllment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, (2010); undefined; Jun, (2021); Bhargava, Kriti, Wireless sensor network based advisory system for Apple Scab prevention, (2014); Bouali, Et Taibi, Renewable Energy Integration into Cloud IoT-Based Smart Agriculture, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 1175-1191, (2022); International Conference on Wireless Technologies Embedded Intell Syst Wits, (2019); Bourhnane, Safae, Machine learning for energy consumption prediction and scheduling in smart buildings, SN Applied Sciences, 2, 2, (2020); Bouali, Et Taibi, Smart Agriculture as a Cyber Physical System: A Real-World Deployment, (2020); Wine Vitic J, (2018); Gagliardi, Gianfranco, An internet of things solution for smart agriculture, Agronomy, 11, 11, (2021)","Bendaoud, M.; El Fathi, A.; Bakhsh, F.I.; Pierluigi, S.","Springer Nature","","International Conference on Electrical Systems and Automation, ICESA 2023","","Al Hoceima","311159","25228714; 25228722","9783031867446; 9783031476112; 9783030760809; 9783031438028; 9783030730253; 9783031573842; 9783031494949; 9783031789038; 9783031461088; 9783031439216","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195560486"

Early and accurate disease detection is essential for timely intervention and mitigation. In this study, we propose a novel approach for plant disease detection using a deep learning method based on a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network, ResNet9 architecture. The ResNet9 model is trained on a diverse dataset of plant images, including both healthy and diseased plants, representing different plant species and diseases. Our method leverages the power of deep learning to automatically learn discriminative features from plant images, enabling it to distinguish between healthy and diseased plants with a high degree of accuracy.

The economy of the nation depends heavily on agriculture. However, choosing crops with better production rates and efficiently controlling crop disease are obstacles that farmers have to face. These issues are addressed in this research by utilizing machine learning methods and real-world datasets. The recommended approach uses a variety of datasets on the production of crops, soil conditions, agro-meteorological regions, crop disease, and meteorological factors. These datasets offer insightful information on disease trends, soil nutrition demand of crops, and agricultural production history. By incorporating this knowledge, the model first recommends the list of primarily selected crops based on the soil nutrition of a particular user location. Then the predictions of meteorological variables like temperature, rainfall, and humidity are made using SARIMAX models. These weather predictions are then used to forecast the possibilities of diseases for the primary crops list by utilizing the support vector classifier. Finally, the developed model makes use of the decision tree regression model to forecast crop yield and provides a final crop list along with associated possible disease forecast. Utilizing the outcome of the model, farmers may choose the best productive crops as well as prevent crop diseases and reduce output losses by taking preventive actions. Consequently, planning and decision-making processes are supported and farmers can predict possible crop yields. Overall, by offering a detailed decision support system for crop selection and disease prediction, this work can play a vital role in advancing agricultural practices in Bangladesh. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Crop Disease; Crop Production; Crop Suggesting Model; Haversine Formula; Machine Learning; Sarimax; Cultivation; Decision Support Systems; Decision Trees; Food Supply; Nutrition; Regression Analysis; Soils; Support Vector Machines; Weather Forecasting; Bangladesh; Crop Disease; Crop Production; Crop Selections; Crop Suggesting Model; Crop Yield; Haversine Formulas; Machine-learning; Sarimax; Soil Nutrition; Crops","Cultivation; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Food supply; Nutrition; Regression analysis; Soils; Support vector machines; Weather forecasting; Bangladesh; Crop disease; Crop production; Crop selections; Crop suggesting model; Crop yield; Haversine formulas; Machine-learning; SARIMAX; Soil nutrition; Crops","","","","International Journal of Business and Management Invention, (2017); International Journal of Engineering Research Technology Ijert, (2020); Hatfield, Jerry L., Climate impacts on agriculture: Implications for crop production, Agronomy Journal, 103, 2, pp. 351-370, (2011); Zubair, Md Ibna, An Intelligent Model to Suggest Top Productive Seasonal Crops Based on User Location in the Context of Bangladesh, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 235, pp. 289-300, (2022); Khaki, Saeed, Crop yield prediction using deep neural networks, Frontiers in Plant Science, 10, (2019); Elavarasan, Dhivya, Forecasting yield by integrating agrarian factors and machine learning models: A survey, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 155, pp. 257-282, (2018); Khattab, Ahmed K.F., An IoT-based cognitive monitoring system for early plant disease forecast, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 166, (2019); Ip, Ryan H.L., Big data and machine learning for crop protection, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 151, pp. 376-383, (2018); Afrin, Sadia, Analysis of Soil Properties and Climatic Data to Predict Crop Yields and Cluster Different Agricultural Regions of Bangladesh, pp. 80-85, (2018); Agricultural Research, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2024 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, Electrical, and Smart Systems, iCACCESS 2024","","Dhaka","199060","","9798350350289","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192026394"

Trend analyses were performed for 19 indicators sourced from global databases and World Food Programme national data, representing the four domains of food system resilience: exposure to shocks; resilience capacities and agro- and food diversity, resilience responses and strategies; and long-term resilience outcomes. The analysis revealed that all six countries experienced the effects of the ‘polycrisis’, leading to diverse impacts on exchange rates, with Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Lao PDR facing significant currency depreciation. While most countries increased crop production and decreased food imports during the crisis, government economic support during the pandemic varied widely. Resilience outcomes, including national food price inflation and the proportion of populations facing food insecurity, witnessed upward variations. Overall, countries with higher resilience capacities at the start of the ‘polycrisis’ showed less severe long-term resilience outcomes. Our findings highlight the varied challenges and resilience capacities across each country, influenced by a complex interplay of economic, political, agricultural, and food affordability factors crucial for determining long-term resilience in their food systems.

The observed variations and projected changes in rainfall and temperature seve-rely affect the small islands and island states (SIS) more than large countries. In this study, we analyse the long-term changes in total rainfall, its seasonal varia-tions, the number of rainy days and extreme events based on standardized global datasets and ground ob-servations for SIS, including island regions of India, to identify suitable adaptation options in order to ensure sustainable food production. We link these climatic para-meters with the observed waterlogging, moisture stress and salinity, compounded by the sea-water intrusion, which severely affects agricultural diversification and food production. In these areas, climate-smart alternative land management (ALM) methods, viz. raised beds, paddy–fish, farm ponds with broader dykes, etc. have been demonstrated and evaluated against these climate change-linked challenges at smallholder farms in the Andaman Islands and Sundarbans region of India. The results showed that the ALM methods created favour-able conditions for crop growth and agricultural diver-sification by excluding sea-water intrusion, harvesting rainwater, reducing salinity and facilitating drainage amidst extreme events experienced during the observa-tion period (2010–2020). ALM enhanced on-farm food production (2.7–34.6 tonne ha–1 rice equivalent yield), sustainability (0.23–0.79, measured as sustainable yield index) and net mitigation benefit (2.2–5.7 Mg CO<inf>2</inf> eq. year–1), providing greater scope for its upscaling in the island and coastal regions as adaptation measures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation; Alternative Land Management; Climate Change; Coastal Regions And Islands; Waterlogging; Coastal Zones; Farms; Land Use; Landforms; Rain; Seawater; Tropics; Adaptation; Alternative Land Management; Coastal Region And Island; Coastal Regions; Food Production; Food Production Systems; Land Managements; Management Method; Small Island; Waterlogging; Climate Change","Coastal zones; Farms; Land use; Landforms; Rain; Seawater; Tropics; Adaptation; Alternative land management; Coastal region and island; Coastal regions; Food production; Food production systems; Land managements; Management method; Small island; Waterlogging; Climate change","","","We thank the National Agricultural Inno-vation Project – GEF, Director and Project Director (CSSRI, Karnal) for providing all necessary support.

This study collects cropland records of each county in Taiyuan City based on historical documents, agricultural statistics, and survey data such as the Gazetteers, Agriculture and Commercial Statistics Table and Datasets of Land and Resources of China. The cropland area at the county level from 1650 to 1980 is determined by revising, correcting, and extrapolating the obtained historical records. By assessing the driving physiogeographic factors for the distribution of cropland through GeoDetector, we establish a land suitability-based gridded allocation model. The cropland areas at the county level are allocated into 1 km × 1 km grid cells. Our results indicated the following. (1) The total cropland area increased since the Qing Dynasty, reaching its maximum value in 1937, after which it declined due to the impact of urbanization after 1937. (2) In terms of the spatial distribution patterns of cropland, from 1650 to 1980, the cropland was mainly distributed in the Fenhe River Valley Plain, and the cropland expanded from the center to the south after 1952. (3) Comparing the reconstruction results for 1980 with the 1 km resolution satellite-based cropland cover data, differences of most (95.77%) grids are between −20% and +20%, comparing the HYDE3.2 dataset with our results. The HYDE3.2 dataset is distinctly lower than our datasets, and the grids with large differences are mainly in the central and southern parts of the study area, especially in the Qing Dynasty. Our reconstruction could evaluate the accuracy of the global dataset when applied to regional areas and serve as base data in studying historical climate change. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gridded Allocation; Historical Cropland Cover; Land Suitability; Taiyuan City; Accuracy Assessment; Agricultural Land; Historical Perspective; Land Cover; Land Use Change; Reconstruction; Satellite Data; Spatiotemporal Analysis; China; Shanxi; Taiyuan","accuracy assessment; agricultural land; historical perspective; land cover; land use change; reconstruction; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Shanxi; Taiyuan","","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No.41807433, grant No.41972193 and grant No.42101103).","Science Plan and Implementation Strategy, (2005); Pongratz, Julia, Radiative forcing from anthropogenic land cover change since A.D. 800, Geophysical Research Letters, 36, 2, (2009); Sterling, Shannon M., The impact of global land-cover change on the terrestrial water cycle, Nature Climate Change, 3, 4, pp. 385-390, (2013); Borrelli, Pasquale, An assessment of the global impact of 21st century land use change on soil erosion, Nature Communications, 8, 1, (2017); Friedlingstein, Pierre, Global Carbon Budget 2022, Earth System Science Data, 14, 11, pp. 4811-4900, (2022); Jia, Gensuo, Land-climate interactions, pp. 131-247, (2022); Feddema, Johannes Jan, Atmospheric science: The importance of land-cover change in simulating future climates, Science, 310, 5754, pp. 1674-1678, (2005); Future Earth Initial Design Report of the Transition Team, (2013); Progress in Geography, (2015); Lepers, Erika, A synthesis of information on rapid land-cover change for the period 1981-2000, BioScience, 55, 2, pp. 115-124, (2005)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","2073445X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183116154"

In general, the approach relies on a change detection analysis applied on pre- and post-event images. This change detection analysis usually is carried out by comparing the values of specific spectral indices such as: NBR (normalised burn ratio), BAI (burn area index), MIRBI (mid-infrared burn index). However, some potential sources of error arise, particularly when near-real-time automated approaches are adopted. An automated approach is mandatory when the burnt area monitoring should operate systematically on a given area of large size (country). Potential sources of errors include but are not limited to clouds on the pre- or post-event images, clouds or topographic shadows, agricultural practices, image pixel size, level of damage, etc. Some authors have already noted differences between global databases of burnt areas based on satellite images. Sources of errors could be related to the spatial resolution of the images used, the land-cover mask adopted to avoid false alarms, and the quality of the cloud and shadow masks. This paper aims to compare different burnt areas datasets (EFFIS, ESACCI, Copernicus, FIRMS, etc.) with the objective to analyse their differences. The comparison is restricted to the Italian territory. Furthermore, the paper aims to identify the degree of approximation of these satellite-based datasets by relying on ground survey data as ground truth. To do so, ground survey data provided by CUFA (Comando Unità Forestali, Ambientali e Agroalimentari Carabinieri) and CFVA (Corpo Forestale e Vigilanza Ambientale Sardegna) were used. The results confirm the existence of significant differences between the datasets. The subsequent comparison with the ground surveys, which was conducted while also taking into account their own approximations, allowed us to identify the accuracy of the satellite-based datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Burnt Area; Dataset; Effis; Esacci; Firms; Remote Sensing; Satellite; Sentinel-2; Errors; Satellite Imagery; Burnt Areas; Change Detection Analysis; Dataset; Effis; Esacci; Firms; Ground Surveys; Potential Sources; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Remote Sensing","Errors; Satellite imagery; Burnt areas; Change detection analysis; Dataset; EFFIS; ESACCI; FIRMS; Ground surveys; Potential sources; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Remote sensing","","","The activities were carried out in the framework of the H2020 European project FirEUrisk, funded by the European Commission (contract n. 101003890).","Keeley, Jon E., Fire intensity, fire severity and burn severity: A brief review and suggested usage, International Journal of Wildland Fire, 18, 1, pp. 116-126, (2009); Firemon Fire Effects Monitoring and Inventory System, (2006); de Santis, Angela, GeoCBI: A modified version of the Composite Burn Index for the initial assessment of the short-term burn severity from remotely sensed data, Remote Sensing of Environment, 113, 3, pp. 554-562, (2009); Garcia-Llamas, Paula, Evaluation and comparison of Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and Deimos-1 remote sensing indices for assessing burn severity in Mediterranean fire-prone ecosystems, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 80, pp. 137-144, (2019); van der Werf, Guido R., Global fire emissions estimates during 1997-2016, Earth System Science Data, 9, 2, pp. 697-720, (2017); Seiler, Wolfgang, Estimates of gross and net fluxes of carbon between the biosphere and the atmosphere from biomass burning, Climatic Change, 2, 3, pp. 207-247, (1980); Laneve, G., The daily fire hazard index: A fire danger rating method for mediterranean areas, Remote Sensing, 12, 15, (2020); Liu, Sichong Cong, A novel fire index-based burned area change detection approach using Landsat-8 OLI data, European Journal of Remote Sensing, 53, 1, pp. 104-112, (2020); Polychronaki, Anastasia, Burned area mapping in greece using SPOT-4 HRVIR images and object-based image analysis, Remote Sensing, 4, 2, pp. 424-438, (2012); Knopp, Lisa, A deep learning approach for burned area segmentation with Sentinel-2 data, Remote Sensing, 12, 15, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20724292","9780891814184; 0891814183; 9780123694072","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181893428"

Universal Soil Loss Equations (USLE) and their modifications have been appreciated and commonly applied among many methods. The idea of this work is to use the ESDAC database (a web platform hosting a series of pan-European and global datasets on soil erosion) to build the modified form of the USLE for the Zagożdzonka catchment, a small agricultural area located in central Poland. The calculated sediment yield is compared with the one determined based on the reservoir survey. The conducted analyses show that the average annual suspended sediment yield from the study catchment estimated using the MUSLE equation accounts for 201 Mg and is close to that determined based on the reservoir survey, i.e., 248 Mg. However, MUSLE, with the initially proposed parameters, will overpredict sediment transport at the study site. The ESDAC database may support local studies concerning soil erosion and sediment transport.

Sub-technology such as PCA and WT have inherent limit with regards to the ability to preserve both spatial and spectral properties. To fill the above-mentioned gaps, this work presents a CAMFNet; a framework that integrates multiscale fusion together with Visible (VIS), Near-Infrared (NIR) and Thermal Infrared (TIR) data for fusion and feature extraction and classification. CAMFNet uses classifiers like Gradient Tree Boost and SVM for differentiating people, cars, trees and other such objects. Feature extraction is carried out using PCA and HOG for enhancing the methods prior to the extraction. One of the radical innovations is the employment of certain aspects in CAMFNet, including multiscale feature extraction and attention mechanisms for boosted data fusion. The framework also involves generative aerial networks (GANs) and it is capable of preserving important spatial and spatial details profiles thereby making it to be more accurate, to more recalls and has low false positives compared to normal methods. Experiments made on real-world datasets coming from different landscapes, revealed that the CAMFNet outperformed the other networks in the classification metrics, as well as in PSNR and SSIM. Surveillance, agriculture, and the military are some of its uses to emphasize work in large-scale and distant investigations.

As such, research related to the effect of ecosystem services and diversity on crop yields has increased significantly in the past decade. One such study by Dainese and colleagues that presented a global synthesis of a compiled database of 1,475 crop experiments related to pollination and pest control ecosystem services and crop yields quickly garnered attention in the literature with more than 540 citations since its publication in 2019. Given the strong influence of this study on the research on diversity and agricultural production, we conduct a reanalysis on the publicly available dataset from the global synthesis study to test the robustness of findings to modeling approach and assumptions. In our reanalysis we apply ordinary least squares regression methods rather than Bayesian path analysis to the same data to examine the robustness of observed field-scale landscape diversity-ecosystem services- crop yield relationships. The result of our reanalysis supports the findings of Dainese and colleagues, illustrating the robustness of findings that suggest that increasing landscape simplicity is associated with lower rates of pollination and pest control ecosystem service provisioning and lower crop yields. However, our analyses also suggest that provisioning of pollination and pest control services account for only a small fraction of the total effect of landscape simplicity on crop yields. Furthermore, we find that management and soil health may mediate the effects of landscape simplicity on ecosystem services and crop yields. While our results complement previous findings for landscape simplicity and ecosystem services, they also indicate that above and below ground ecosystem services are not mutually exclusive but concurrently contribute to support crop production in agriculture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Article; Biodiversity; Controlled Study; Crop; Crop Production; Data Base; Ecosystem Service; Harvest; Landscape; Least Square Analysis; Nonhuman; Path Analysis; Pest Control; Pollination; Soil Health; Bayes Theorem; Ecosystem; Procedures; Agriculture; Bayes Theorem; Biodiversity; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Pollination","agriculture; article; biodiversity; controlled study; crop; crop production; data base; ecosystem service; harvest; landscape; least square analysis; nonhuman; path analysis; pest control; pollination; soil health; Bayes theorem; ecosystem; procedures; Agriculture; Bayes Theorem; Biodiversity; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Pollination","","","","World Population Prospects 2022 World Population Prospects 2022 Summary of Results, (2025); Environmental Entomology, (1983); Organic Farming A Promising Way of Food Production, (2016); Chen, Jianguo, Diversity increases yield but reduces harvest index in crop mixtures, Nature Plants, 7, 7, pp. 893-898, (2021); Foley, Jonathan A., Solutions for a cultivated planet, Nature, 478, 7369, pp. 337-342, (2011); Seufert, Verena, Comparing the yields of organic and conventional agriculture, Nature, 485, 7397, pp. 229-232, (2012); Dainese, Matteo, A global synthesis reveals biodiversity-mediated benefits for crop production, Science Advances, 5, 10, (2019); Smith, Richard G., Effects of crop diversity on agroecosystem function: Crop yield response, Ecosystems, 11, 3, pp. 355-366, (2008); Mijatović, Dunja, The role of agricultural biodiversity in strengthening resilience to climate change: Towards an analytical framework, International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability, 11, 2, pp. 95-107, (2013); Liere, Heidi, Trophic cascades in agricultural landscapes: Indirect effects of landscape composition on crop yield, Ecological Applications, 25, 3, pp. 652-661, (2015)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","38096199","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179771840"

Biochar, a type of carbonized biomass which can be produced from crop residues (CRs), offers a promising solution for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) when it is used to sequester photosynthetically fixed carbon that would otherwise have been returned to atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> through respiration or combustion. However, high-resolution spatially explicit maps of CR resources and their capacity for climate change mitigation through biochar production are currently lacking, with previous global studies relying on coarse (mostly country scale) aggregated statistics. By developing a comprehensive high spatial resolution global dataset of CR production, we show that, globally, CRs generate around 2.4 Pg C annually. If 100% of these residues were utilized, the maximum theoretical technical potential for biochar production from CRs amounts to 1.0 Pg C year−1 (3.7 Pg CO<inf>2</inf>e year−1). The permanence of biochar differs across regions, with the fraction of initial carbon that remains after 100 years ranging from 60% in warm climates to nearly 100% in cryosols. Assuming that biochar is sequestered in soils close to point of production, approximately 0.72 Pg C year−1 (2.6 Pg CO<inf>2</inf>e year−1) of the technical potential would remain sequestered after 100 years. However, when considering limitations on sustainable residue harvesting and competing livestock usage, the global biochar production potential decreases to 0.51 Pg C year−1 (1.9 Pg CO<inf>2</inf>e year−1), with 0.36 Pg C year−1 (1.3 Pg CO<inf>2</inf>e year−1) remaining sequestered after a century. Twelve countries have the technical potential to sequester over one fifth of their current emissions as biochar from CRs, with Bhutan (68%) and India (53%) having the largest ratios. The high-resolution maps of CR production and biochar sequestration potential provided here will provide valuable insights and support decision-making related to biochar production and investment in biochar production capacity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biochar; Carbon Sequestration; Crop Residues; Geospatial Information Science; Global Maps; Negative Emissions; Agricultural Wastes; Biomass; Crops; Decision Making; Global Warming; Bio-energy; Biochar; Carbon Sequestration; Crop Residue; Geospatial Information Science; Global Map; Negative Emission; Residue Production; Spatially Explicit Assessments; Technical Potential; Carbon Dioxide; Biochar; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Carbon Sequestration; Crop Residue; Gis; Bhutan; India","Agricultural wastes; Biomass; Crops; Decision making; Global warming; Bio-energy; Biochar; Carbon sequestration; Crop residue; Geospatial information science; Global map; Negative emission; Residue production; Spatially explicit assessments; Technical potential; Carbon dioxide; biochar; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; crop residue; GIS; Bhutan; India","","","We thank Chandrakant Singh for assistance with python code for spatial analysis.","Anand, Abhijeet, Biochar production from crop residues, its characterization and utilization for electricity generation in India, Journal of Cleaner Production, 368, (2022); Baruch-Mordo, Sharon, From Paris to practice: Sustainable implementation of renewable energy goals, Environmental Research Letters, 14, 2, (2019); Bentsen, Niclas Scott, Agricultural residue production and potentials for energy and materials services, Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 40, 1, pp. 59-73, (2014); Borchard, Nils, Biochar, soil and land-use interactions that reduce nitrate leaching and N2O emissions: A meta-analysis, Science of the Total Environment, 651, pp. 2354-2364, (2019); Chatterjee, Amitava, Annual crop residue production and nutrient replacement costs for Bioenergy feedstock production in United States, Agronomy Journal, 105, 3, pp. 685-692, (2013); Cornelissen, Gerard, Emissions and char quality of flame-curtain ""Kon Tiki"" kilns for farmer-scale charcoal/biochar production, PLOS ONE, 11, 5, (2016); DAVIDSON, ERIC A., Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change, Nature, 440, 7081, pp. 165-173, (2006); Domingues, Rimena Ramos, Enhancing cation exchange capacity ofweathered soils using biochar: Feedstock, pyrolysis conditions and addition rate, Agronomy, 10, 6, (2020); Egu General Assembly 2023, (2023); Quarterly Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Eu, (2022)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","17571693; 17571707","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174066103"

Accurate and early detection of tomato diseases is crucial for reducing losses and improving crop management. Current deep learning and CNN research have resulted in the availability of multiple CNN designs, making automated plant disease identification viable rather than traditional visual inspection-based disease detection. When using deep learning Methods, the dataset serves one of the most crucial roles in disease prediction. PlantVillage is the most widely used publicly available dataset for tomato disease detection, but it was created in a laboratory/controlled environment, and models trained on it do not perform well on real-world images. Some natural or real-world datasets are available, but they are private and not publicly available. Also, when attempting to predict tomato diseases on the field in the Jodhpur and Jaipur districts of Rajasthan, India, we found that the majority of diseases are leaf miner, spotted wilt virus, and Nnutrition deficiency diseases, but there are no public datasets containing such categories. To overcome these challenges, we propose the creation of a new dataset called “Tomato-Village” with three variants: (a) multiclass tomato disease classification, (b) multilabel tomato disease classification, and (c) object detection-based tomato disease detection. To our best knowledge, “Tomato-Village” will be the first such dataset to be available publicly.

This study was conducted in Raya and Kobo Valleys, a semi-arid region in Northern Ethiopia, considering both the structural basin and the surrounding mountainous recharge areas. Climatic Research Unit monthly datasets for 1991 to 2020 and WaPOR actual evapotranspiration data were used. The model results show that the average annual recharge and surface runoff from 1991 to 2020 were 73 mm and 167 mm, respectively, with a substantial portion contributed along the front of the mountainous parts of the study area. The mountainous recharge occurred along and above the valleys as mountain-block and mountain-front recharge. The long-term estimates of the monthly recharge time series indicated that the water balance components follow the temporal pattern of rainfall amount. However, the relation of recharge to precipitation was nonlinearly related, showing the episodic nature of recharge in semi-arid regions. This study informed the spatial and temporal distribution of recharge and runoff hydrologic variables at fine spatial scales for each grid cell, allowing results to be summarized for various planning units, including farmlands. One third of the precipitation in the drainage basin becomes recharge and runoff, while the remaining is lost through evapotranspiration. The current study’s findings are vital for developing plans for sustainable management of water resources in semi-arid regions. Also, monthly groundwater withdrawals for agriculture should be regulated in relation to spatial and temporal recharge patterns. We conclude that combining scarce local data with global datasets and tools is a useful approach for estimating recharge to manage groundwater resources in data-scarce regions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fine Scale; Groundwater; Recharge; Runoff; Water Balance; Drainage Basin; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Recharge; Runoff; Semiarid Region; Temporal Distribution; Time Series; Water Budget; Ethiopian Rift","drainage basin; evapotranspiration; groundwater; recharge; runoff; semiarid region; temporal distribution; time series; water budget; Ethiopian Rift","","","","Groundwater Research Issues in Africa, (2008); Gaye, Cheikh Bécaye, Review: Challenges and opportunities for sustainable groundwater management in Africa, Hydrogeology Journal, 27, 3, pp. 1099-1110, (2019); Scanlon, Bridget R., Global synthesis of groundwater recharge in semiarid and arid regions, Hydrological Processes, 20, 15, pp. 3335-3370, (2006); Ahmed, Ahmed Khaled Abdella, Forecasting of Groundwater Quality by Using Deep Learning Time Series Techniques in an Arid Region, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 8, (2023); Uugulu, Shoopala, Estimation of groundwater recharge in savannah aquifers along a precipitation gradient using chloride mass balance method and environmental isotopes, Namibia, Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, 116, (2020); Healy, Richard W., Using groundwater levels to estimate recharge, Hydrogeology Journal, 10, 1, pp. 91-109, (2002); Messerschmid, Clemens, Spatial distribution of groundwater recharge, based on regionalised soil moisture models in Wadi Natuf karst aquifers, Palestine, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 26, 4, pp. 1043-1061, (2022); Dubois, Emmanuel, Simulation of long-term spatiotemporal variations in regional-scale groundwater recharge: Contributions of a water budget approach in cold and humid climates, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 25, 12, pp. 6567-6589, (2021); Demissie, Endale Siyoum, Groundwater Recharge Estimation in Upper Gelana Watershed, South-Western Main Ethiopian Rift Valley, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 3, (2023); Kafando, Moussa Bruno, Quantification of Soil Deep Drainage and Aquifer Recharge Dynamics according to Land Use and Land Cover in the Basement Zone of Burkina Faso in West Africa, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 22, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183127386"

Unlike human faces, the faces of most Hanwoo cattle, a native breed of Korea, exhibit significant similarities and have the same body color, posing a substantial challenge in accurately distinguishing between individual cattle. In this study, we sought to extend the closed-set scope (only including identifying known individuals) to a more-adaptable open-set recognition scenario (identifying both known and unknown individuals) termed Cattle’s Face Open-Set Recognition (CFOSR). By integrating open-set techniques to enhance the closed-set accuracy, the proposed method simultaneously addresses the open-set scenario. In CFOSR, the objective is to develop a trained model capable of accurately identifying known individuals, while effectively handling unknown or novel individuals, even in cases where the model has been trained solely on known individuals. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates Adversarial Reciprocal Points Learning (ARPL), a state-of-the-art open-set recognition method, with the effectiveness of Additive Margin Softmax loss (AM-Softmax). ARPL was leveraged to mitigate the overlap between spaces of known and unknown or unregistered cattle. At the same time, AM-Softmax was chosen over the conventional Cross-Entropy loss (CE) to classify known individuals. The empirical results obtained from a real-world dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the ARPL and AM-Softmax techniques in achieving both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Notably, the results of the open-set recognition and closed-set recognition validated the superior performance of our proposed method compared to existing algorithms. To be more precise, our method achieved an AUROC of 91.84 and an OSCR of 87.85 in the context of open-set recognition on a complex dataset. Simultaneously, it demonstrated an accuracy of 94.46 for closed-set recognition. We believe that our study provides a novel vision to improve the classification accuracy of the closed set. Simultaneously, it holds the potential to significantly contribute to herd monitoring and inventory management, especially in scenarios involving the presence of unknown or novel cattle. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Animal Welfare; Cattle’s Face Recognition; Deep Learning; Open-set Recognition; Precision Livestock Farming; Accuracy; Agricultural Worker; Algorithm; Animal Welfare; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Network; Artificial Ventilation; Behavior; Bovine; Breed; Classifier; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Deterioration; Facial Recognition; Feeding; Herd; Human; Korea; Learning; Livestock; Multinomial Logistic Regression; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Reproduction; Training","accuracy; agricultural worker; algorithm; animal welfare; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; artificial ventilation; behavior; bovine; breed; classifier; convolutional neural network; deep learning; deterioration; facial recognition; feeding; herd; human; Korea; learning; livestock; multinomial logistic regression; receiver operating characteristic; reproduction; training","","","This work was supported by the Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture and Forestry (IPET) and Korea Smart Farm Foundation (KosFarm) through the Smart Farm Innovation Technology Development Program, funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) and the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Rural Development Administration (RDA) (1545027423).

Data analytics and modeling tools play a key role in fighting this challenge, as they can help identify key sources as well as trace transport and quantify impact within complex hydrological systems. Several tools exist for simulating and tracing pollutant transport throughout surface waters using detailed physical models; these tools are powerful, but can be computationally intensive, require significant amounts of data to be developed, and require expert knowledge for their use (ultimately limiting application scope). In this work, we present a graph modeling framework – which we call HydroGraphs – for understanding pollutant transport and fate across waterbodies, rivers, and watersheds. This framework uses a simplified representation of hydrological systems that can be constructed based purely on open-source data (National Hydrography Dataset and Watershed Boundary Dataset). The graph representation provides a flexible intuitive approach for capturing connectivity and for identifying upstream pollutant sources and for tracing downstream impacts within small and large hydrological systems. Moreover, the graph representation can facilitate the use of advanced algorithms and tools of graph theory, topology, optimization, and machine learning to aid data analytics and decision-making. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework by using case studies in the State of Wisconsin; here, we aim to identify upstream nutrient pollutant sources that arise from agricultural practices and trace downstream impacts to waterbodies, rivers, and streams. Our tool ultimately seeks to help stakeholders design effective pollution prevention/mitigation practices and evaluate how surface waters respond to such practices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Connectivity; Graph Theory; Hydrology; Lakes; Nutrients; Pollutants; Rivers; Watersheds; Data Analytics; Decision Making; Decision Theory; Graph Theory; Graphic Methods; Machine Learning; Nutrients; Open Systems; River Pollution; Watersheds; Connectivity; Downstream Impacts; Graph Representation; Graph-based Models; Hydrological System; Modelling Framework; Pollutant; Pollutant Sources; Pollutants Transport; Waterbodies; Rivers","Data Analytics; Decision making; Decision theory; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Machine learning; Nutrients; Open systems; River pollution; Watersheds; Connectivity; Downstream impacts; Graph representation; Graph-based models; Hydrological system; Modelling framework; Pollutant; Pollutant sources; Pollutants transport; Waterbodies; Rivers","","","We acknowledge support from the U.S. EPA (contract number EP-18-C-000016 ).

A specific object of this research is the implemented risk assessment and management system, part of the drinking water safety plan for Sofia city. The water supply system from the water source to the end user, operated by Sofiyska voda JSC and part of Veolia, was analyzed. The hazards and risk events were reviewed for each component of the system—the catchment, water source, supply water pipes, drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) and distribution water network. The results of the risk evaluation show that the risk of an algal bloom falls from medium risk, with a value of 36 in 2018. This risk was new for the Iskar Dam—the main water source for Sofia city. The purpose of the current study is to analyze the risk of blue-green algae blooming and the potential release of toxins in the Iskar Dam. A data analysis of phytoplankton counts, temperature of the water in the dam, precipitation, algal diversity and quantity of microcystins for a period of three years shows that there is a low probability of algae blooming. The concentration of microcystin LR was below 0.6 µg/L and of microcystin YR was below 0.1 µg/L. The highest phytoplankton count was 70,000 cells/mL in 2018, and it decreased to 30,000 cells/mL in 2020. The impact of the risk of “blue-green algae blooms in the Iskar Dam” is assessed as moderate (3) and that has not changed between 2018 and 2022. The likelihood of occurrence of this risk decreased from possible (3) to unlikely (2) after risk reassessment, and the current control effectiveness changed from weakly controlled (4) in 2018 to well controlled (2) in 2022, because more risk management actions were included in Sofiyska voda JSC. The results of the risk evaluation show that the risk of an algal bloom falls into the low-risk category with a value of 12, after measures were considered and a reassessment. As a preventive measure for better management and risk minimization, it is necessary to continue monitoring the phytoplankton count, species composition, concentration of algae toxins (microcystin LR) and nutrients in raw water from the Iskar Dam. This research has added value to the global database for surface water sources intended for human consumption and is focuses on a potential problem, valid for agricultural as well as for urban territories rich in diffused sources of pollution. The specific risk evaluation and management steps could be used and adapted by other water supply companies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algae Toxins; Blue-green Algae Blooming; Drinking Water Quality And Safety; Microcystins; Risk Evaluation And Management; Catchments; Dams; Health Risks; Phytoplankton; Potable Water; Quality Control; Reservoirs (water); Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Water Quality; Water Supply Systems; Water Treatment; Alga Toxin; Blue Green Algae; Blue-green Alga Blooming; Drinking Water Quality And Safety; Drinking-water Qualities; Microcystins; Quality And Safeties; Risk Evaluation; Risks Management; Water Safety; Water Supply","Catchments; Dams; Health risks; Phytoplankton; Potable water; Quality control; Reservoirs (water); Risk assessment; Risk management; Water quality; Water supply systems; Water treatment; Alga toxin; Blue green algae; Blue-green alga blooming; Drinking water quality and safety; Drinking-water qualities; Microcystins; Quality and safeties; Risk evaluation; Risks management; Water safety; Water supply","","","This research was supported by the Sofiyska voda JSC and Grant № BG05M2OP001-1.002-0019: “Clean Technologies for Sustainable Environment—Water, Waste, Energy for a Circular Economy” financed by the Science and Education for Smart Growth Operational Program (2014–2020) co-financed by the EU through the ESIF.","Sustainable Development Goal; Wan, Liu, Impacts of Climate Change and Non-Point-Source Pollution on Water Quality and Algal Blooms in the Shoalhaven River Estuary, NSW, Australia, Water (Switzerland), 14, 12, (2022); Ferencz, Beata, Role of Hydrology in Cyanobacterial Blooms in the Floodplain Lakes, Water (Switzerland), 15, 8, (2023); Chidiac, Sandra, A comprehensive review of water quality indices (WQIs): history, models, attempts and perspectives, Reviews in Environmental Science and Biotechnology, 22, 2, pp. 349-395, (2023); Lakes Handbook Limnology and Limnetic Ecology, (2004); Jetoo, Savitri, The toledo drinking water advisory: Suggested application of the water safety planning approach, Sustainability (Switzerland), 7, 8, pp. 9787-9808, (2015); Li, Jianzhong, Estimating Effects of Natural and Anthropogenic Activities on Trophic Level of Inland Water: Analysis of Poyang Lake Basin, China, with Landsat-8 Observations, Remote Sensing, 15, 6, (2023); Stoyneva-Gärtner, Maya P., M.

In this study, the upper part of the Porsuk Basin in Türkiye is analyzed using SWAT. In the analysis, in addition to the data provided by the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI), the freely available flow and water quality data from the GEMStat data portal were used. This study presents a discussion of the practicality of GEMStat data for a water quality model. For this purpose, firstly, the SWAT model was constructed with freely available global data sources on elevation, land use/land cover, and soil type. Then, the model flow outputs were calibrated and validated for both DSI and GEMStat data in three different time periods. As a result, the flow calibration and validation success in the daily time step is 0.64 and 0.44 according to the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The model was also validated using GEMStat flow data and calibrated using GEMStat water quality data such as nitrate (NO<inf>3</inf>), total suspended solids (TSS), and dissolved oxygen (DO) with a reasonable value.

However, the issue of the uncertainly, applicability, and limitations of LULC data products is always a challenge and varies distinctively worldwide, especially in the tropics where forest loss is rapid. Eight of the most widely used LULC datasets, here, including 500-m MCD12Q1, 300-m ESA CCI-LC, 30-m GlobelLand30, 30-m GLC_FCS30, 30-m FROM-GLC, 10-m World Cover, 10-m Esri Land Cover, and 10-m FROM-GLC10, were statistically compared and evaluated the consistency and reliability in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA). The results revealed that the FROM-GLC10, World Cover, and GLC_FCS30 have higher accuracy than the other five datasets, with overall accuracy ranging from 90.8 to 92.2%, while FROM-GLC had the lowest accuracy of 77.7%. GlobeLand30, FROM-GLC, and FROM-GLC10 were the most similar with a correlation coefficient of 0.999 compared to only 0.882 for ESA CCI-LC and World Cover. Eight LULC-based forests (52.2%–70.4%) and cropland (21.6%–43.9%) are the predominant LULCs in MSEA, with the ESA CCI-LC having the largest estimated area (844,800 km2, 43.9%) of cropland, which also results in it having the smallest area (52.2%) of forest. Compared to other datasets, Esri Land Cover had the most extensive distribution of built-up land (4.9%), while World Cover had larger areas of grassland cover (9.8%). In particular, the spatial patterns of cropland and forest are highly consistent, but there are significant local differences, e.g., in western Myanmar and southern Vietnam. The MCD12Q1, ESA CCI-LC, and GLC_FCS30 showed consistent overall trends in forest change across the five countries of MSEA over the past two decades, while GlobelLand30 produced different results. Our cross-comparison and evaluation based on eight global LULC datasets in MSEA highlighted the consistency and differences, which will help to select the suitable dataset for specific needs (e.g., regional ecosystem response to forest loss) in the future. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accuracy Assessment; Consistency Analysis; Forest Loss; Global Land Use And Land Cover Dataset; Mainland Southeast Asia; Remote Sensing Mapping; Forestry; Land Use; Mapping; Surface Measurement; Tropics; Accuracy Assessment; Consistency Analysis; Forest Loss; Global Land Use And Land Cover Dataset; Land Cover; Land Cover Datasets; Land Use And Land Cover; Mainland Southeast Asia; Remote Sensing Mapping; Remote-sensing; Remote Sensing; Accuracy Assessment; Agricultural Land; Ecosystem Response; Grassland; Land Cover; Land Use; Mapping; Remote Sensing; Tracking; Myanmar; Viet Nam","Forestry; Land use; Mapping; Surface measurement; Tropics; Accuracy assessment; Consistency analysis; Forest loss; Global land use and land cover dataset; Land cover; Land cover datasets; Land use and land cover; Mainland Southeast Asia; Remote sensing mapping; Remote-sensing; Remote sensing; accuracy assessment; agricultural land; ecosystem response; grassland; land cover; land use; mapping; remote sensing; tracking; Myanmar; Viet Nam","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42371280, 42130508, and 42001226), the Programme of Kezhen-Bingwei Excellent Young Scientists of the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022RC002), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA28060302).

Taking preindustrial cropland expansion in France, Germany, and Italy as a case study, this study first adopted a productivity-based estimation of cropland per capita, which converted crop yield to cropland demand per capita through negative correlations under different crop rotations, to improve the accuracy of national cropland areas. Then, a new allocation algorithm was proposed to allocate national cropland areas into 5′× 5′ grids. The algorithm combines land suitability, which characterizes regional differentiation of potential productivity indicated by physiogeographic factors (climate, topography, soil, etc.) that dominate cultivation, and cultivation preference, which quantifies sociocultural impacts by kernel density estimation based on city information (i.e., location, size, accessibility). The cropland cover scenario here shows similar phases but different modes of cropland expansion in these countries: (1) National cropland areas increased 1.73–2.46 times during the 11th–13th centuries, manifested by the expanding cultivated ranges in France and Germany and the increasing cultivation intensity in Italy. (2) National cropland fractions decreased by 9.16–19.98 percentage points in the 14th century, accompanied by widespread reductions in cultivation intensity. (3) Cropland gradually recovered toward its peak in 1300 AD during the 15th–18th centuries, achieved by general and remarkable increases in cultivation intensity. Compared to representative global datasets, this study is more consistent with cultivation-related descriptions in the literature, especially with respect to the cropland expansion in newly cultivated regions and on marginal lands. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anthropogenic Land Cover Change; Cropland Cover Scenario; Empirical Data; Europe; Preindustrialization; Agricultural Land; Algorithm; Crop Yield; Cultivation; Empirical Analysis; Human Activity; Industrialization; Land Cover; France; Germany; Italy","agricultural land; algorithm; crop yield; cultivation; empirical analysis; human activity; industrialization; land cover; France; Germany; Italy","","","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2017YFA0603304 ).

Vision-equipped robots are being deployed in the fields to take care of crops and control weeds. However, publicly available agricultural datasets containing both image data as well as data from navigational robot sensors are scarce.

RumexWeeds includes whole image sequences instead of individual static images, which is rare for computer vision image datasets, yet crucial for robotic applications. It allows for more robust object detection, incorporating temporal aspects and considering different viewpoints of the same object. Furthermore, RumexWeeds includes data from additional navigational robot sensors—GNSS, IMU and odometry—which can increase robustness, when additionally fed to detection models. In total the dataset includes 5510 images with 15,519 manual bounding box annotations collected at three different farms and four different days in summer and autumn 2021.

In this application context, however, very few data sets are available to the community and for some important crops, such as grapes and olives, they are almost absent. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to introduce and release ARD-VO, a data set for agricultural robotics applications focused on vineyards and olive cultivations. Its main purpose is to provide the researchers with a real-world extensive set of data to support the development of solutions and algorithms for precision farming technologies in the aforementioned crops. ARD-VO has been collected with an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with different heterogeneous sensors that capture information essential for robot localization and plant monitoring tasks. It is composed of sequences gathered in 11 experimental sessions between August and October 2021, navigating the UGV for several kilometers in four cultivation fields in Umbria, a central region of Italy. In addition, to highlight the utility of ARD-VO, two application case studies are presented. In the first one, the data set is used to compare the performance of simultaneous localization and mapping and odometry estimation methods using vision systems, light detection and ranging, and inertial measurement unit sensors. The second one shows how the multispectral images included in ARD-VO can be used to compute Normalized Difference Vegetation Index maps, which are crucial to monitor the crops and build prescription maps. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Robotics; Plant Monitoring; Robotic Data Set; Agricultural Robots; Cultivation; Farms; Global Positioning System; Ground Vehicles; Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems; Robot Applications; Agricultural Robot; Agricultural Robotics; Application Contexts; Data Set; Olive Grove; Plant Monitoring; Precision-farming; Real-world; Robotic Data Set; Robotics Applications; Crops","Agricultural robots; Cultivation; Farms; Global positioning system; Ground vehicles; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Robot applications; Agricultural robot; Agricultural robotics; Application contexts; Data set; Olive grove; Plant monitoring; Precision-farming; Real-world; Robotic data set; Robotics applications; Crops","","","This work was supported by the project “Gruppo Operativo Agrobot” in the framework of the initiative “PSR Umbria 2014/2020, Misura 16.2.” The authors acknowledge the role of Cratia SRL (Confagricoltura Umbria) in the project management and the collaboration of: Departement of Engineering and Departement of Agricultural, Alimentary and Enviromental Sciences of the University of Perugia; Fondazione per l'Istruzione Agraria of Perugia; Life Science Institute of Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies of Pisa; “Ciuffelli Einaudi” Technical Agricultural Institute of Todi (PG); Assoprol Umbria and Infomobility SRL Modena.

Most of the investigations had focused on particular problems of carbon and nitrogen pools and fluxes, or had covered a narrow range of ecosystems. Therefore, the idea of this research was to carry out a multi-disciplinary study of carbon fluxes and pools in the sector of agriculture and land use – one of the main sources of GHG – in regions with humid continental climate that are the most affected by current climate change. Our work was aimed at solving the problem of quantifying GHG fluxes and carbon pools in crop and livestock production, analyzing the reasons for their formation and possible absorption pathways at three locations in the European part of Russia in the cold continental climate zone. The study examined both agricultural and natural ecosystems; field measurements, laboratory analyses, and simulation modelling techniques were applied. The sites included seven types of ecosystems: croplands, pastures, hayfields, fallows, forests, stockyards, and compost piles. Livestock facilities are potent sources of three main biogenic GHG (0.42 − 9.27 g C-CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1; 2.43 − 783.51 mg C-CH<inf>4</inf> m-2 h-1; 0.01 − 1.49 mg N-N<inf>2</inf>O m-2 h-1); whereas croplands, hayfields and forests can absorb methane (from −1.10 to −118.2 μg C-CH<inf>4</inf> m-2 h-1), as well as pastures, hayfields, fallows and forests are weak sinks of nitrous oxide (from −0.10 to −4.57 μg N-N<inf>2</inf>O m-2 h-1). Ecosystems were ranked using a non-parametric test by increasing rate of CO<inf>2</inf> emission from soil in the following order: croplands (0.06 − 0.24 g C-CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) ≤ hayfields (0.06 − 0.25 g C-CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) ≤ pastures (0.06 − 0.22 g C-CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) = fallows (0.13 − 0.26 g C-CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) = forests (0.16 − 0.30 g CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) ≤ stockyards (0.42 − 1.57 g CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) < compost piles (1.95 − 9.27 g CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1). According to the correlation analysis, the most important dynamic environmental factor on which the intensity of soil respiration depends is the soil temperature at the depth of 10 cm (r = 0.55 − 0.97, p < 0.05). As the regression analysis shows, hydrothermal and agrochemical controls explain the 46 − 89% variance of CO<inf>2</inf> emission from soil. The content of total carbon (1.31−7.95%) as well as of total nitrogen (0.12 − 0.62%) in soil follows a latitudinal pattern and increases from north to south regardless of the type of land use and farming intensity. The amount of carbon incorporated into the arable soil layer by root residues decreases in the following sequence: barley > winter wheat > spring wheat > oats > soybean from 402 to 198 kg C ha-1 yr-1. Field crop stubble is an additional source of soil carbon at 118 − 368 kg C ha-1 yr-1 in the following sequence: spring wheat > winter wheat > oats > soybean > barley. According to simulation modelling (DeNitrification-DeComposition model, DNDC; and Rothamsted Carbon model, RothC), accumulation of soil organic carbon is possible under winter wheat (270 kg C ha-1 yr-1), while under other crops its stocks decrease (from −190 to −423 kg C ha-1 yr-1). According to DNDC modelling, agrolandscapes are net sinks of carbon to a varying degree (at least 500 kg C ha-1 yr-1), with phytomass being the main pool of carbon sink, most of which is removed with yields. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Methane; Net Ecosystem Exchange; Nitrous Oxide; Phytomass; Soil Organic Carbon; Soil Respiration; Agricultural Ecosystem; Carbon Flux; Climate Change; Greenhouse Gas; Methane; Net Ecosystem Exchange; Organic Carbon; Phytomass; Soil Carbon; Soil Respiration; Eastern Europe; Russian Federation","agricultural ecosystem; carbon flux; climate change; greenhouse gas; methane; net ecosystem exchange; organic carbon; phytomass; soil carbon; soil respiration; Eastern Europe; Russian Federation","","","The work was carried out within the framework of the state assignment of the Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences (FMGE-2019–0007) and in accordance with the Order No. 25–15r of September 2, 2022, of the Government of the Russian Federation for the purpose of implementing the innovation project of national importance, aimed at creating a unified system for monitoring climatic active substances.","undefined, (2022); Afzali, Sayed Fakhreddin, Using RothC model to simulate soil organic carbon stocks under different climate change scenarios for the rangelands of the arid regions of southern Iran, Water (Switzerland), 11, 10, (2019); Balafoutis, Athanasios T., Precision agriculture technologies positively contributing to ghg emissions mitigation, farm productivity and economics, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 8, (2017); Balashov, Eugene V., N2O fluxes from agricultural soils in Slovakia and Russia -direct measurements and prediction using the DNDC model, Folia Oecologica, 37, 1, pp. 8-15, (2010); Balashov, Eugene V., Field validation of DNDC and SWAP models for temperature and water content of loamy and sandy loam Spodosols, International Agrophysics, 28, 2, pp. 133-142, (2014); Barančíková, Gabriela, Application of RothC model to predict soil organic carbon stock on agricultural soils of Slovakia, Soil and Water Research, 5, 1, pp. 1-9, (2010); Beck, Hylke E., Present and future köppen-geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution, Scientific Data, 5, (2018); de Bernardi, Maria, Impact of land use change on soil methane fluxes and diffusivity in Pampean plains, Argentina, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 329, (2022); Bezuglova, Olga S., Interrelationship between the physical properties and the humus content of chernozems in the south of European Russia, Eurasian Soil Science, 39, 2, pp. 187-194, (2006); Biernat, Lars, Nitrous oxide emissions and methane uptake from organic and conventionally managed arable crop rotations on farms in Northwest Germany, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 8, (2020)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01678809","","AEEND","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152136113"

However, they are of growing global concern due to climate change exacerbating their multiple impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems, carbon storage, human health, economies, and wider society. Temperate regions are predicted to be at greatest risk of increasing fire activity due to climate change, where fires can seriously impact important ecosystems for biodiversity and carbon storage, such as peatlands and forests. There is insufficient literature on the background prevalence, distribution, and drivers of fires in these regions, especially within Europe, to assess and mitigate their risks. Using a global database of fire patches based on the MODIS FireCCI51 product, we address this knowledge gap by quantifying the current prevalence and size of fires in Polesia, a 150,000 km2 area comprising a mosaic of peatland, forest, and agricultural habitats in northern Ukraine and southern Belarus. Between 2001 and 2019, fires burned 31,062 km2 of land, and were most frequent in spring and autumn. Although most fires started in agricultural land, fires disproportionately affected natural and semi-natural land cover types, particularly in protected areas. Over one fifth of protected land burned. Coniferous forests were the most common land cover type in protected areas, but fires mostly occurred in meadows, open peatlands (especially fen and transition mires), and native deciduous forests. These land cover types were highly susceptible to fires under low soil moisture conditions, but the risk of fire was low under average or higher soil moisture conditions. Restoring and maintaining natural hydrological regimes could be an effective nature-based solution to increase the resilience of fire-vulnerable ecosystems and support global biodiversity and carbon storage commitments under the United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change and Convention on Biological Diversity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fire Drivers; Landscape Fire; Landscape Restoration; Nature-based Solutions; Polesia; Remote-sensing; Carbon; Carbon; Soil; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation; Earth (planet); Ecosystems; Environmental Protection; Fires; Forestry; Risk Assessment; Soil Moisture; Wetlands; Carbon Storage; Fire Driver; Land-cover Types; Landscape Fire; Landscape Restoration; Moisture Conditions; Nature-based Solution; Peat Land; Polesia; Remote-sensing; Remote Sensing; Agricultural Land; Biodiversity; Carbon Storage; Database; Deciduous Forest; Fire Behavior; Fire Management; Landscape Structure; Literature Review; Meadow; Modis; Moisture Content; Nature Conservation; Peatland; Protected Area; Remote Sensing; Temperate Environment; United Nations Framework Convention On Climate Change; Article; Autumn; Belarus; Climate Change; Drought; Ecosystem; Europe; Fire; Forest; Habitat; Human; Knowledge Gap; Land Use; Landscape; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Soil Moisture; Spring; Ukraine; United Nations; Grassland; Soil; Polissya; Carbon; Carbon; Ecosystem; Forests; Grassland; Humans; Soil","Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Earth (planet); Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Fires; Forestry; Risk assessment; Soil moisture; Wetlands; Carbon storage; Fire driver; Land-cover types; Landscape fire; Landscape restoration; Moisture conditions; Nature-based solution; Peat land; Polesia; Remote-sensing; Remote sensing; agricultural land; biodiversity; carbon storage; database; deciduous forest; fire behavior; fire management; landscape structure; literature review; meadow; MODIS; moisture content; nature conservation; peatland; protected area; remote sensing; temperate environment; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; article; autumn; Belarus; climate change; drought; ecosystem; Europe; fire; forest; habitat; human; knowledge gap; land use; landscape; prevalence; risk assessment; soil moisture; spring; Ukraine; United Nations; grassland; soil; Polissya; carbon; Carbon; Ecosystem; Forests; Grassland; Humans; Soil","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon; Soil","We would like to acknowledge support from the BTO and the Endangered Landscapes Programme (ELP).

Yet, at a global scale, systematic evaluations of human–bird coexistence in croplands are scarce. Here, we compiled and used meta-analysis approaches to synthesize multiple global datasets of ecological and social dimensions to understand this complex coexistence system. Our result shows that birds usually increase woody, but not herbaceous, crop production, implying that crop loss mitigation efforts are critical for a better coexistence. We reveal that many nonlethal technical measures are more effective in reducing crop loss, e.g., using scaring devices and changing sow practices, than other available methods. Besides, we find that stakeholders from low-income countries are more likely to perceive the crop losses caused by birds and are less positive toward birds than those from high-income ones. Based on our evidence, we identified potential regional clusters, particularly in tropical areas, for implementing win-win coexistence strategies. Overall, we provide an evidence-based knowledge flow and solutions for stakeholders to integrate the conservation and management of birds in croplands. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Bird; Crop Production; Cropland; Highest Income Group; Human; Low Income Country; Meta Analysis; Mitigation; Nonhuman; Tropics; Agriculture; Animal; Crop; Environmental Protection; Female; Pig; Procedures; Agriculture; Animals; Birds; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Female; Humans; Swine","article; bird; crop production; cropland; highest income group; human; low income country; meta analysis; mitigation; nonhuman; tropics; agriculture; animal; crop; environmental protection; female; pig; procedures; Agriculture; Animals; Birds; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Female; Humans; Swine","","","","Global Sustainable Development Report 2019 the Future is Now Science for Achieving Sustainable Development, (2021); Laurance, William F., Averting biodiversity collapse in tropical forest protected areas, Nature, 489, 7415, pp. 290-293, (2012); Geldmann, Jonas, A global-level assessment of the effectiveness of protected areas at resisting anthropogenic pressures, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 116, 46, pp. 23209-23215, (2019); Cazalis, Victor, Effectiveness of protected areas in conserving tropical forest birds, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); Nyhus, Philip J., Human-Wildlife Conflict and Coexistence, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 41, pp. 143-171, (2016); Dainese, Matteo, A global synthesis reveals biodiversity-mediated benefits for crop production, Science Advances, 5, 10, (2019); Green, Andy J., Ecosystem services provided by waterbirds, Biological Reviews, 89, 1, pp. 105-122, (2014); Michel, Nicole L., Ecosystem services provided by Neotropical birds, Condor, 122, 3, (2020); Whelan, Christopher J., Why birds matter: from economic ornithology to ecosystem services, Journal of Ornithology, 156, pp. 227-238, (2015); Whelan, Christopher J., Ecosystem services provided by birds, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1134, pp. 25-60, (2008)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","15449173; 15457885","","PBLIB","37410698","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164257119"

H08 is a global hydrological model that considers human water use and management (e.g., reservoir operation and crop irrigation). Although a crop growth sub-model has been included in H08 to estimate the global crop-specific calendar, its performance as a yield simulator is poor, mainly because a globally uniform parameter set was used for each crop type. In addition, the effects of CO2 fertilization and vapor pressure deficit on crop yield were not considered. Here, through country-wise parameter calibration and algorithm improvement, we enhanced H08 to simulate the yields of four major staple crops: maize, wheat, rice, and soybean. The simulated crop yield was compared with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) national yield statistics and the global dataset of historical yield for major crops (GDHY) gridded yield estimates with respect to mean bias (across nations) and time series correlation (for individual nations). Our results showed that the effects of CO2 fertilization and vapor pressure deficit had opposite impacts on crop yield. The simulated yield showed good consistency with FAO national yield. The mean biases of the major producer countries were considerably reduced to 2%, 2%, -2%, and -1% for maize, wheat, rice, and soybean, respectively. The capacity of our model to capture the interannual yield variability observed in FAO yield was limited, although the performance of our model was comparable to that of other mainstream global crop models. The grid-level analysis showed that our model showed a similar spatial pattern to that of the GDHY yield in terms of reproducing the temporal variation over a wide area, although substantial differences were observed in other places. Using the enhanced model, we quantified the contributions of irrigation to global food production and compared our results to an earlier study. Overall, our improvements enabled H08 to estimate crop production and hydrology in a single framework, which will be beneficial for global food-water nexus studies in relation to climate change. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Crop Plant; Crop Yield; Food And Agricultural Organization; Hydrological Modeling; Irrigation System; Simulation; Water Resource","climate change; crop plant; crop yield; Food and Agricultural Organization; hydrological modeling; irrigation system; simulation; water resource","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (JPMEERF20202005) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan; the Excellent Young Scientists Fund (Overseas) of the National Natural Science Foundation of China; and the Fund (E3V30030) of Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences.; Funding text 2: This study was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (JPMEERF20202005) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan; the Excellent Young Scientists Fund (Overseas) of the National Natural Science Foundation of China; and the Fund (E3V30030) of Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, the magnitude of crop WUE response to K fertilization has only been reported for individual regions, crops and scales due to lack of extensive and complete global datasets. Here we quantified the responses of crop WUE to K fertilization at the three scales of field-population (WUE<inf>field</inf>), whole-plant (WUE<inf>plant</inf>) and single-leaf (WUE<inf>leaf</inf>) through synthesizing 797 paired observations from 81 field-based studies worldwide. Meta-analysis results showed that K fertilization increased WUE<inf>field</inf>, WUE<inf>plant</inf> and WUE<inf>leaf</inf> of crops by 19.0%, 12.0% and 29.9%, respectively, with the key factors influencing this being crop type, mean annual precipitation and soil pH, respectively. It should be noted that the magnitude of WUE<inf>field</inf>, WUE<inf>plant</inf> and WUE<inf>leaf</inf> response to K fertilization was significantly positively correlated with mean annual precipitation, while significantly negatively correlated with soil pH, which implying that K fertilization is an effective way to improve crop WUE in the region with humid climate or acidic soil. Furthermore, the conclusive findings of this meta-analysis showed that the relative importance of environmental factors in the magnitude of the WUE<inf>field</inf>, WUE<inf>plant</inf> and WUE<inf>leaf</inf> response to K fertilization was 49.8%, 68.8% and 82.0%, respectively, which indicated that climatic characteristics and soil properties were drivers of crop WUE response to K fertilization rather than management practices. Overall, our meta-analysis provides new insight into the crop WUE response to K fertilization from field, plant, to leaf was driven by environmental factors and highlights the great potential of improved field K fertilization strategies in developing sustainable agriculture under the condition of climate change. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Environmental Factors; K Fertilizer; Sustainable Agriculture; Synthetic Analysis; Water Productivity; Crops; Efficiency; Factor Analysis; Fertilizers; Soils; Sustainable Development; Crop Water Use; Environmental Factors; Fertilisation; Field Plants; K Fertilizer; Meta-analysis; Sustainable Agriculture; Synthetic Analysis; Water Productivity; Water Use Efficiency; Climate Change; Agricultural Production; Alternative Agriculture; Climate Change; Crop Improvement; Environmental Factor; Fertilizer Application; Water Use; Water Use Efficiency","Crops; Efficiency; Factor analysis; Fertilizers; Soils; Sustainable development; Crop water use; Environmental factors; Fertilisation; Field plants; K fertilizer; Meta-analysis; Sustainable agriculture; Synthetic analysis; Water productivity; Water use efficiency; Climate change; agricultural production; alternative agriculture; climate change; crop improvement; environmental factor; fertilizer application; water use; water use efficiency","","","This work was financially supported by the Major project of Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, China ( 2021hsz002 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities , China ( 2662021ZH001 ).","Neumann Andersen, Mathias Neumann, The Interaction Effects of Potassium and Drought in Field-Grown Barley.

Recent studies (e.g., SVANN, spatial ensemble) targeting this difficult problem either require a known space-partitioning as the input, or can only support very limited number of partitions or classes (e.g., two) due to the decrease in training data size and the complexity of analysis. To address these limitations, we propose a model-agnostic framework to automatically transform a deep learning model into a spatial-heterogeneity-aware architecture, where the learning of arbitrary space partitionings is guided by a learning-engaged generalization of multivariate scan statistic and parameters are shared based on spatial relationships. Moreover, we propose a spatial moderator to generalize learned space partitionings to new test regions. Finally, we extend the framework by integrating meta-learning-based training strategies into both spatial transformation and moderation to enhance knowledge sharing and adaptation among different processes. Experiment results on real-world datasets show that the framework can effectively capture flexibly shaped heterogeneous footprints and substantially improve prediction performances. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Heterogeneity; Meta-learning; Mobility; Remote Sensing; Spatial; Statistics; Crops; Decision Making; Deep Learning; Learning Systems; Satellite Imagery; Space Optics; Decisions Makings; Heterogeneity; Metalearning; Mobility; Remote-sensing; Space Partitioning; Spatial; Spatial Data; Spatial Heterogeneity; Remote Sensing","Crops; Decision making; Deep learning; Learning systems; Satellite imagery; Space optics; Decisions makings; Heterogeneity; Metalearning; Mobility; Remote-sensing; Space partitioning; Spatial; Spatial data; Spatial heterogeneity; Remote sensing","","","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.2105133, 2126474 and 2147195; NASA under Grant Nos. 80NSSC22K1164 and 80NSSC21K0314; USGS under Grant No. G21AC10207; US-DOT under Grant No.69A3551747131 (through SAFER-SIM); Google’s AI for Social Good Impact Scholars program; the DRI award at the University of Maryland; Pitt Momentum Funds award and CRC at the University of Pittsburgh; and the ISSSF grant from the University of Iowa.","undefined, (2021); Kraemer, Moritz U.G., The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China, Science, 368, 6490, pp. 493-497, (2020); Bao, Han, COVID-GAN: Estimating Human Mobility Responses to COVID-19 Pandemic through Spatio-Temporal Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, pp. 273-282, (2020); Atluri, Gowtham, Spatio-temporal data mining: A survey of problems and methods, ACM Computing Surveys, 51, 4, (2019); Shekhar, Shashi, Spatial computing, Communications of the ACM, 59, 1, pp. 72-81, (2016); Goodchild, Michael F., Replication across space and time must be weak in the social and environmental sciences, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 35, (2021); Karpatne, Anuj, Machine Learning for the Geosciences: Challenges and Opportunities, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 31, 8, pp. 1544-1554, (2019); Krizhevsky, Alex, ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2, pp. 1097-1105, (2012); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016); 1st ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Deep Learning for Spatiotemporal Data Applications and Systems, (2020)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","02193116; 02191377","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149563971"

In most crop models, HI is set as a parameter; this empirical approach does not consider that HI not only depends on plant genotype, but is also affected by the environment. An alternative is to simulate allocation mechanistically, as in the LPJ-GUESS crop model, which simulates HI based on daily growing conditions and the crop development stage. Simulated HI is critical for agricultural research due to its economic importance, but it also can validate the robust representation of production processes. However, there is a challenge to constrain parameter values globally for the allocation processes. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the sensitivity of yield and HI of wheat and maize simulated with LPJ-GUESS to eight production allocation-related parameters and identify the most suitable parameter values for global simulations. The nitrogen demand reduction after anthesis, the minimum leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) and the range of leaf C:N strongly affected carbon assimilation and yield, while the retranslocation of labile stem carbon to grains and the retranslocation rate of nitrogen and carbon from vegetative organs to grains after anthesis mainly influenced HI. A global database of observed HI for both crops was compiled for reference to constrain simulations before calibrating parameters for yield against reference data. Two high- and low-yielding maize cultivars emerged from the calibration, whilst spring and winter cultivars were found appropriate for wheat. The calibrated version of LPJ-GUESS improved the simulation of yield and HI at the global scale for both crops, providing a basis for future studies exploring crop production under different climate and management scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calibration; Lpj-guess; N Concentration; Parameter Sensitivity; Retranslocation; Aboveground Biomass; Agricultural Management; Agricultural Research; Biomass Allocation; Calibration; Climate Effect; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Cultivar; Harvesting; Maize; Modeling; Nitrogen; Wheat","aboveground biomass; agricultural management; agricultural research; biomass allocation; calibration; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; harvesting; maize; modeling; nitrogen; wheat","","","Funding text 1: This paper was funded by the Global Challenges scheme of the University of Birmingham and contributes to the strategic research areas BECC and MERGE.

Despite substantial and continuing concerns about the negative socio-environmental impacts of LSLTs, trade-off analysis on boosting crop yield and minimizing climate-related effects remains limited. Our study makes use of a global dataset on LSLTs for agricultural production to estimate potential carbon emissions based on different scenarios of land cover change and fertilizer use, as well as potential value of agricultural production on transacted land. We show that, if fully implemented on ∼ 38 M ha of transacted land, 2.51 GtC will be emitted during land conversion, with another 24.2 MtC/year emitted from fertilizer use, assuming farming technology of investors’ origin is adopted on transacted land. Comparison of different combinations of forest protection policies and agricultural intensification levels reveals that enforcing strict deforestation regulation while promoting fertilizer use rate improves the carbon efficiency of agricultural production. Additionally, positive spillovers of investors’ farming technology on existing arable lands of host countries can potentially double their crop yield. Our analyses thus suggest that fostering agricultural intensification and technology spillovers under strict regulation on land allocation to investors to protect forests would allow for boosting agricultural yield while minimizing carbon emissions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Yield; Carbon Emission; Large-scale Land Transactions; Sustainable Intensification; Agricultural Intensification; Agricultural Production; Carbon Emission; Crop Yield; Fertilizer Application; Spillover Effect","agricultural intensification; agricultural production; carbon emission; crop yield; fertilizer application; spillover effect","","","","Agrawal, Arun, Governing agriculture-forest landscapes to achieve climate change mitigation, Global Environmental Change, 29, pp. 270-280, (2014); Agrawal, Arun, From environmental governance to governance for sustainability, One Earth, 5, 6, pp. 615-621, (2022); Alcántara, Camilo, Mapping the extent of abandoned farmland in Central and Eastern Europe using MODIS time series satellite data, Environmental Research Letters, 8, 3, (2013); Arneth, Almuth, Historical carbon dioxide emissions caused by land-use changes are possibly larger than assumed, Nature Geoscience, 10, 2, pp. 79-84, (2017); Baylis, Kathy R., Agricultural trade and environmental sustainability, Annual Review of Resource Economics, 13, pp. 379-401, (2021); Borras, Saturnino M., The value of so-called ‘failed’ large-scale land acquisitions, Land Use Policy, 119, (2022); Carlson, Kimberly M., Carbon emissions from forest conversion by Kalimantan oil palm plantations, Nature Climate Change, 3, 3, pp. 283-287, (2013); Food Waste within Global Food Systems, (2013); Curtis, Philip G., Classifying drivers of global forest loss, Science, 361, 6407, pp. 1108-1111, (2018); Davis, Kyle Frankel, Accelerated deforestation driven by large-scale land acquisitions in Cambodia, Nature Geoscience, 8, 10, pp. 772-775, (2015)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09593780","","GECHE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153600587"

Global gridded cropping system datasets are useful in various fields, such as crop and hydrological simulations. They could serve as a source alternative to observed datasets. This study evaluates data on rainfed wheat yield derived from a satellite-based Global Dataset of Historical Yields (GDHY) over Iran from the years 1983–2016 (in this period, the average rainfed wheat yield over Iran was 0.86 tons/ha). The process of development of this dataset employed satellite products, solar radiation, harvested area, crop calendar, and production share by cropping season. Our evaluations were conducted at the country scale, province scale, and in reference to different climates based on the Köppen-Geiger climate classification. The index of agreement over Iran is approximately 0.79, and according to percentage bias, GDHY has a 1.6% error over Iran. The dataset was reliable at the sub-national level, over the western parts, and particularly in the mountainous region. In reference to the root mean square error (tons/ha), it showed the lowest performance in the humid part of Iran (Mazandaran, Gilan, and Golestan provinces). Drought analysis showed that the reference crop yield dataset over the study area is more consistent with SPI-12, although GDHY agrees with SPI-3. In contrast to drier years in recent years, the crop yield has increased. This positive trend can be justified by increasing the rate of fertilizer applications, better grazing, an overall improvement in farming technologies, and better farm management at the country scale. In conclusion, GDHY can be used at the national scale for different analyses or modeling, but it is inaccurate at the sub-national level. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arid Region; Crop Productivity; Food Security; Harvested Area; Reanalysis; Arid Region; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Fertilizer Application; Food Security; Rainfed Agriculture; Wheat; Iran","arid region; crop production; crop yield; fertilizer application; food security; rainfed agriculture; wheat; Iran","","","We would like to acknowledge the editor and anonymous reviewers for providing insightful reviews of the manuscript, which improved the quality of the manuscript.

However, its definition, using pentad-averaged soil moisture, could result in low accuracy in assessing the drought occurrence, making it difficult to analyze various factors controlling the formation of flash droughts. Here we used a stochastic water balance framework to quantify the whole probability structure of the timing for soil moisture dropping from a higher level to a lower one. Based on this framework, we can theoretically examine the nonlinear relationship between the rapid decline rate of soil moisture and various hydrometeorological factors and identify possible flash drought risks caused by less rainfall (e.g., long dry spells), higher evapotranspiration (e.g., extreme heat waves), lower soil water storage capacity (e.g., deforestation), or a combination thereof. Applying this framework to the global datasets, we obtained global maps of the average time for drought development and the risks of flash drought. We found that possible flash drought development in humid regions, such as southern China and the northeastern United States, calls particular attention to the need for flash drought monitoring and mitigation.

In our study, a global database of 572 observations from 202 research publications analysed to explore the impacts of increased atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> on soil microbial diversities. The soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), structural (microbial populations), and functional (enzymatic activities) microbial diversities were analysed across 22 nations and 108 crops (including forest, grassland and C3 plants). The impact of three elevated CO<inf>2</inf> (eCO<inf>2</inf>) concentrations i.e., <25%, 25–50% and >50% over ambient in three-time scale (1970–1989, 1990–2009 and 2010–2020) and two region (tropical and temperate) on the above parameters were studied. Higher MBC contents were found under eCO<inf>2</inf> level (>50%) followed by eCO<inf>2</inf> level 25–50% and <25% over ambient in C3 plants and forest ecology, however, in grassland the average MBC content was higher under eCO<inf>2</inf> level 25–50%. Soil enzymatic activities were higher under eCO<inf>2</inf> (25–50%) than other elevated CO<inf>2</inf> conditions in the forest and C3 plants, whereas in grasslands, the enzymatic activities decreased with an increase in CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations. These findings suggested that grassland was more sensitive to elevated CO<inf>2</inf> as such compared to the forest and C3 plants. Both the bacterial and fungal populations were higher only up to eCO<inf>2</inf> level (25–50% over ambient) in all the vegetations. So, higher microbial populations and soil enzymatic activities were noticed up to 50% elevation of CO<inf>2</inf> over ambient conditions irrespective of the vegetation and region indicating higher belowground soil activities. Therefore, the findings suggested that there would be higher belowground soil activities in increased CO<inf>2</inf> levels (anticipated climate change scenario) in agriculture and forest crop up to a certain threshold elevation of CO<inf>2</inf> which needs better water and nutrient management for getting sustainable yield. The finding also suggested region and vegetation-specific (crop/forest/grassland) management options are necessary for fetching advantage of CO<inf>2</inf> fertilization and to tackle the abiotic stress management of crops. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crops; Elevated Co2; Meta-analysis; Microbial Diversities; Rhizosphere; Yield","","","","Authors are grateful to the ICAR-National Fellow Project (Agri.

Early response can greatly improve containment efforts, underscoring the importance of collecting up-to-date information about the locations where pest species are being observed. However, existing invasive species databases have limitations in both extent and rapidity. The spatial extent is limited by costs and there are delays between species establishment, official recording, and consolidation. Local online news outlets have the potential to provide supplemental spatial coverage worldwide and social media has the potential to provide direct observations and denser historical data for modeling. Gathering data from these online sources presents its own challenges and their potential contribution to historical tracking of pest invasions has not previously been tested. To this end, we examine the practical considerations for using three online aggregators, the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT), Google News, and a commercial media listening platform, Brandwatch, to support pest biosurveillance. Using these tools, we investigate the presence and nature of cogent mentions of invasive species in these sources by conducting case studies of online news and Twitter excerpts regarding two invasive plant pests, Spotted Lanternfly and Tuta absoluta. Our results using past data demonstrate that online news and social media may provide valuable data streams to supplement official sources describing pest invasions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gdelt; Geospatial–temporal; Invasive Pests; Online News; Text Mining; Twitter; Forestry; Geo-spatial; Geospatial–temporal; Global Database; Global Database Of Event, Language And Tone; Invasive Pest; Online News; Plant Pests; Social Media; Text-mining; Twitter; Social Networking (online); Data Mining; Invasive Species; Pest Outbreak; Social Media; Spatiotemporal Analysis","Forestry; Geo-spatial; Geospatial–temporal; Global database; Global database of event, language and tone; Invasive pest; Online news; Plant pests; Social media; Text-mining; Twitter; Social networking (online); data mining; invasive species; pest outbreak; social media; spatiotemporal analysis","","","Funding text 1: We thank Chris Jones, Research Scholar at North Carolina State University, for providing and explaining the Spotted Lanternfly survey data.

It is crucial in making national, provincial, and regional choices and estimates the government to meet the food demands of its citizens. Crop production is anticipated based on various factors such as soil conditions and meteorological, environmental, and crop variables. This study intends to develop an effective model that can accurately anticipate agricultural production in advance, assisting farmers in better planning. In the current study, the Crop Yield Prediction Dataset is normalized initially, and then feature engineering is performed to determine the significance of the feature in assessing the crop yield. Crop yield forecasting is performed using the Multi-Layer Perceptron model and the Spider Monkey Optimization method. The Multi-Layer Perceptron technique is efficient in dealing with the non-linear relations among the features in the data, and the Spider Monkey Optimization technique would assist in optimizing the corresponding feature weights. The current study uses data from the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Data Bank to forecast maize yield in the Saudi Arabia region based on factors such as average temperature, average rainfall, and Hg/Ha production in past years. The suggested MLP-SMO model’s prediction effectiveness is being evaluated using several evaluation metrics such as Root-Mean-Square Error, R-Squared, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Bias Error, where the model has outperformed in the prediction process with a Root-Mean-Square Error value of 0.11, which is lowest among all the techniques that are considered in the statical analysis in the current study. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crop Yield; Multi-layer Perceptron; Performance Analysis; Prediction; Spider Monkey Optimization; Agricultural Production; Crop Yield; Government; Maize; Optimization; Performance Assessment; Prediction; Software; Saudi Arabia","agricultural production; crop yield; government; maize; optimization; performance assessment; prediction; software; Saudi Arabia","","","Funding text 1: The author extends his appreciation to the Deputyship for Research and Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia, for funding this research work through the project number (IFT20157).; Funding text 2: The paper funding was performed by the Deputyship for Research and Innovation, Ministry of Education, Saudi Arabia, through project number IFT20157.","Al-Adhaileh, Mosleh Hmoud, Artificial intelligence framework for modeling and predicting crop yield to enhance food security in Saudi Arabia, PeerJ Computer Science, 8, (2022); Jayagopal, Prabhu, Weather-based maize yield forecast in Saudi Arabia using statistical analysis and machine learning, Acta Geophysica, 70, 6, pp. 2901-2916, (2022); Elzaki, Raga Mohamed, Optimal crop combination under soaring oil and energy prices in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 83, (2022); Gana, Rajaram, Ridge Regression and the Elastic Net: How Do They Do as Finders of True Regressors and Their Coefficients?, Mathematics, 10, 17, (2022); Proceedings, (2020); Srinivasu, Parvathaneni Naga, A comparative review of optimisation techniques in segmentation of brain MR images, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 38, 5, pp. 6031-6043, (2020); Guleria, Pratiyush, XAI Framework for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using Classification Techniques, Electronics (Switzerland), 11, 24, (2022); New Developments and Environmental Applications of Drones, (2022); Feng, Puyu, Dynamic wheat yield forecasts are improved by a hybrid approach using a biophysical model and machine learning technique, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 285-286, (2020); Nyéki, Aniko, Crop Yield Prediction in Precision Agriculture, Agronomy, 12, 10, (2022)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149269874"

The species is threatened by uncontrolled harvesting of its roots for pharmaceutical applications and by the extension of agricultural land. This study assessed the role of environmental variables for the current distribution and the potential impact of climate change on the future spatial distribution of U. chamae in Benin. We used data related to climate, soil, topography and land cover to model the distribution of the species. Occurrence data were combined with six least correlated bioclimatic variables derived from the WorldClim database, data on soil layers (texture and pH) and topography (slope) obtained from the FAO world database and land cover from the DIVA-GIS site. Random Forest (RF), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm were used to predict the current and future (2050–2070) distribution of the species. Two climate change scenarios (SSP245 and SSP585) were considered for the future predictions. The results showed that climate (i.e., water availability) and soil type are the key predictors of the distribution of the species. Based on future climate projections, RF, GLM and GAM models predict that the Guinean-Congolian and Sudano-Guinean zones of Benin will remain suitable for U. chamae, while it will decline in these zones according to the MaxEnt model. These results call for a timely management effort for the species in Benin through its introduction into agroforestry systems to ensure the continuity of its ecosystem services. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Conditions; Ecological Niche Modeling; Ecosystem Services; Wild Edible Plant","","","","Mrs Emilienne Houévo DAÏ was supported by Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World [3240314465].","Rendón-Sandoval, Francisco Javier, Traditional agroforestry systems and conservation of native plant diversity of seasonally dry tropical forests, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 11, (2020); Fonta, M.

The combined use of MT with/without straw mulching (SM) in current studies, however, limits us from understanding the relative contributions of certain conservation principles, and thus their potential for carbon accumulation. In this study, a synthesis was conducted based on a global database to explore the SOC accumulation potential by separating the relative importance of MT and SM. The results show that SM had a better performance in enhancing soil properties than MT, including decreasing soil bulk density (BD) as well as increasing SOC concentration down to deeper soil layers. Adopting SM, MT and the combination of SM and MT (SMMT) significantly promoted SOC sequestration in the 0–30 cm soil, but had no significant impact on SOC sequestration when deeper soil layers were considered. Nevertheless, the overall SOC sequestration rate under SM was over two times higher than MT, and especially, adopting SM could maintain SOC stock in the subsoil. Furthermore, we found that adoption of SMMT had positive impacts on SOC stock accumulations with increasing experimental duration, mean annual precipitation (MAP), and mean annual temperature (MAT) in the surface 0–5 cm soil. The results highlight that it is equally important to increase SOC sequestration in the surface soil and maintain SOC stock in the subsoil, which has been overlooked in current assessments. Further increase of carbon sequestration could be expected by applying proper MT practices over long-term in certain climatic conditions, but a reform of current MT framework through involving SM more deeply is critical in global sustainable agriculture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Accumulation; Climate Change; Croplands; Minimum Tillage; Straw Mulching; Agricultural Land; Bulk Density; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Climate Conditions; Experimental Study; Mitigation; Mulching; Precipitation (climatology); Soil Depth; Soil Organic Matter; Straw; Tillage","agricultural land; bulk density; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate conditions; experimental study; mitigation; mulching; precipitation (climatology); soil depth; soil organic matter; straw; tillage","","","This research was jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 42277325, 41971241 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province (grant no. 212300410199, 202300410276 ), and the Key Scientific Research Project of Colleges and Universities of Henan Province (grant no. 21A210026 ) .","Angers, Denis A., Full-inversion tillage and organic carbon distribution in soil profiles: A meta-analysis, Soil Science Society of America Journal, 72, 5, pp. 1370-1374, (2008); Conant, Richard Theodore, Impacts of periodic tillage on soil C stocks: A synthesis, Soil and Tillage Research, 95, 1-2, pp. 1-10, (2007); Corbeels, Marc, Limits of conservation agriculture to overcome low crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa, Nature Food, 1, 7, pp. 447-454, (2020); Dikgwatlhe, Shadrack Batsile, Tillage and residue management effects on temporal changes in soil organic carbon and fractions of a silty loam soil in the North China Plain, Soil Use and Management, 30, 4, pp. 496-506, (2014); Don, Axel, Impact of tropical land-use change on soil organic carbon stocks - a meta-analysis, Global Change Biology, 17, 4, pp. 1658-1670, (2011); Du, Zhangliu, The effect of no-till on organic C storage in Chinese soils should not be overemphasized: A meta-analysis, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 236, pp. 1-11, (2017); Ghuman, Birinder Singh, Tillage and residue management effects on soil properties and yields of rainfed maize and wheat in a subhumid subtropical climate, Soil and Tillage Research, 58, 1-2, pp. 1-10, (2001); Huggins, David R., No-till: The quiet revolution, Scientific American, 299, 1, pp. 70-77, (2008); Lal, Rattan A., Soil carbon sequestration impacts on global climate change and food security, Science, 304, 5677, pp. 1623-1627, (2004); Lal, Rattan A., Managing Soil Carbon, Science, 304, 5669, (2004)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","11610301","","EJAGE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145183808"

The implications of these specific aspects of environmental change are not immediately obvious; therefore, it is hard to obtain a bigger picture of what these changes imply and distinguish the beneficial from the detrimental, where human impact is concerned. In this paper, I describe a holistic approach that allows us to obtain such a bigger picture and use it to understand how the terrestrial biosphere can be sustained in the presence of increased human activity. This approach places particular emphasis on the free energy generated by photosynthesis—energy that is required to sustain both the dissipative metabolic activity of ecosystems and human activities (with the generation rate being restricted by the physical constraints of the environment). Thus, one can then identify two types of human influence on the biosphere and their resulting consequences: the detrimental effects caused by enhanced human consumption of this free energy and the beneficial effects that allow for more photosynthetic activity and, therefore, more dissipative activity within the biosphere. I use examples from the terrestrial biosphere to illustrate this view and global datasets to indicate how this can be quantified. Thereafter, I discuss how certain aspects of modern technology can enhance free energy generation within the terrestrial biosphere, which can, in turn, safeguard its sustenance even as human activity increasingly shapes the functioning of the Earth system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exergy; Global Change; Maximum Power; Planetary Boundaries; Sustainability","","","","","Global Precipitation Climatology Project Gpcp Climate Data Record CDR, (2017); Ayres, Robert U., Thermodynamics and Economics, Physics Today, 37, 11, pp. 62-71, (1984); Beer, Christian, Terrestrial gross carbon dioxide uptake: Global distribution and covariation with climate, Science, 329, 5993, pp. 834-838, (2010); Clarke, Andrew, Climate, energy and diversity, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273, 1599, pp. 2257-2266, (2006); Cleveland, Cutler J., Energy and the U.S. economy: A biophysical perspective, Science, 225, 4665, pp. 890-897, (1984); Conte, Luigi, Effects of Tropical Deforestation on Surface Energy Balance Partitioning in Southeastern Amazonia Estimated From Maximum Convective Power, Geophysical Research Letters, 46, 8, pp. 4396-4403, (2019); Cowan, Ian R., Stomatal function in relation to leaf metabolism and environment., Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology, 31, pp. 471-505, (1977); Currie, David J., Predictions and tests of climate-based hypotheses of broad-scale variation in taxonomic richness, Ecology Letters, 7, 12, pp. 1121-1134, (2004); Elimelech, Menachem, The future of seawater desalination: Energy, technology, and the environment, Science, 333, 6043, pp. 712-717, (2011); Annual Review of Plant Physiology, (1958)","","Indian Society for Ecological Economics (INSEE)","","","","","","25816152; 25816101","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149121105"

Weather generators are often used to generate stochastic rainfall time series; however, no such model exists for the generation of a stochastically plausible PET time series. Here we develop a stochastic PET generator, stoPET, by leveraging a recently published global dataset of hourly PET at 0.1° resolution (hPET). stoPET is designed to simulate realistic time series of PET that capture the diurnal and seasonal variability in hPET and to support the simulation of various scenarios of climate change. The parsimonious model is based on a sine function fitted to the monthly average diurnal cycle of hPET, producing parameters that are then used to generate any number of synthetic series of randomised hourly PET for a specific climate scenario at any point of the global land surface between 55° N and 55° S. In addition to supporting a stochastic analysis of historical PET, stoPET also incorporates three methods to account for potential future changes in atmospheric evaporative demand to rising global temperature. These include (1) a user-defined percentage increase in annual PET, (2) a step change in PET based on a unit increase in temperature, and (3) the extrapolation of the historical trend in hPET into the future. We evaluated stoPET at a regional scale and at 12 locations spanning arid and humid climatic regions around the globe. stoPET generates PET distributions that are statistically similar to hPET and an independent PET dataset from CRU, thereby capturing their diurnal/seasonal dynamics, indicating that stoPET produces physically plausible diurnal and seasonal PET variability. We provide examples of how stoPET can generate large ensembles of PET for future climate scenario analysis in sectors like agriculture and water resources with minimal computational demand. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arid Region; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Diurnal Variation; Land Surface; Land-atmosphere Interaction; Potential Evapotranspiration; Scenario Analysis; Seasonal Variation; Time Series Analysis","arid region; climate change; climate effect; diurnal variation; land surface; land-atmosphere interaction; potential evapotranspiration; scenario analysis; seasonal variation; time series analysis","","","Funding text 1: We acknowledge financial support from the Royal Society (grant no.

However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise their performance, integrity, and privacy. This research focuses on defending crop recommendation systems against poisoning and evasion attacks, which aim to manipulate the training data and deceive the model during prediction, respectively. The research investigates the vulnerabilities of crop recommendation systems to adversarial attacks and analyzes potential risks and consequences. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed defenses, extensive experiments are conducted using a real-world dataset of crop information. The results demonstrate the susceptibility of crop recommendation systems to adversarial attacks. Specifically, the accuracy of the model decreases to 0.64 and 0.65 under poisoned attacks, while the precision drops to 0.77 and 0.65. However, after implementing the defense mechanisms, the model's accuracy and precision improve to 0.73 and 0.75, respectively. Additionally, under evasion attacks, the model's recall decreases to 0.48 and the F1-score drops to 0.70. Nevertheless, the defense mechanisms significantly improve the model's recall to 0.86 and the F1-score to 0.80. The research also assesses the performance of the defense mechanisms by quantifying their ability to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks, demonstrating significant improvements achieved through their deployment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adversarial Attacks; Adversarial Training; Crop Recommendation Systems; Data Poisoning Detection; Evasion Attacks; Poisoning Attacks; Query Sanitization; Crops; Cultivation; Drops; Network Security; Search Engines; Adversarial Attack; Adversarial Training; Crop Recommendation System; Data Poisoning Detection; Defence Mechanisms; Evasion Attack; Performance; Poisoning Attacks; Query Sanitization; Sanitization; Recommender Systems","Crops; Cultivation; Drops; Network security; Search engines; Adversarial attack; Adversarial training; Crop recommendation system; Data poisoning detection; Defence mechanisms; Evasion attack; Performance; Poisoning attacks; Query sanitization; Sanitization; Recommender systems","","","","Maresh Nelson, Scott B., Sensitivity of North American grassland birds to weather and climate variability, Conservation Biology, 38, 1, (2024); Exploring the Limits of Indiscriminate Data Poisoning Attacks, (2024); Pad Towards Principled Adversarial Malware Detection Against Evasion Attacks, (2023); Van Etten, Jacob, Data-driven approaches can harness crop diversity to address heterogeneous needs for breeding products, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 120, 14, (2023); Harrou, Fouzi, Statistical Process Monitoring Using Advanced Data-Driven and Deep Learning Approaches: Theory and Practical Applications, pp. 1-315, (2020); Wadhwani, Ganesh Kumar, Sentiment Analysis and Comprehensive Evaluation of Supervised Machine Learning Models Using Twitter Data on Russia–Ukraine War, SN Computer Science, 4, 4, (2023); Tian, Zhiyi, A Comprehensive Survey on Poisoning Attacks and Countermeasures in Machine Learning, ACM Computing Surveys, 55, 8, (2023); Herath, Jerome Dinal, Real-Time Evasion Attacks against Deep Learning-Based Anomaly Detection from Distributed System Logs, pp. 29-40, (2021); Gupta, Rajeev Kumar, Preface, pp. xv-xix, (2023); Machine Learning Master Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Algorithms with Real Examples English Edition, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st IEEE International Conference on Ambient Intelligence, Knowledge Informatics and Industrial Electronics, AIKIIE 2023","","Ballari; Rao Bahadur Y.

In general, the approach relies on a change detection analysis applied on pre- and post-event images [1]. This change detection analysis is usually carried out by comparing the values of specific spectral indices such as: NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) [2], BAI (Burned Area Index) [3], MIRBI (Mid Infrared Burn Index) [4]. However, some potential sources of error arise, in particular when near-real-time automated approaches are adopted. An automated approach is needed when the burnt area monitoring should operate systematically on a given area of large sizes (country). Potential sources of error are: clouds on the pre- or post-event images, clouds or topographic shadows [5], agricultural practices, image pixel size, level of damage, etc. [6]Sources of difference between different existing global datasets of burned areas based on satellite images could be related to the spatial resolution of the images used, the land cover mask adopted to avoid false alarms, the quality of the cloud and shadow masks. This paper aims at comparing several burned area databases (EFFIS, ESACCI, Copernicus, FIRMS, etc.) with the objective of identifying and characterizing their approximations. In order to do so, ground survey data provided by CUFA (Comando unità forestali, ambientali e agroalimentari Carabinieri) and CFVA (Corpo Forestale e Vigilanza Ambientale Sardegna) have been used. In using ground data, the accessibility of the burned area has been also considered in order to account for the approximations due to the difficulties in reaching the affected area. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Burnt Areas; Datasets; Fireurisk; Satellite Images; Wildfires","","","","5.

It builds a virtual space by mirroring a physical space and performs different simulations to solve problems that are complicated or impossible to solve in the physical space. Livestock farming in agriculture is evolving rapidly with the introduction of various information and communication technologies for digital farming. However, only few studies have examined the digital twin in terms of HVAC systems directly related to productivity in livestock farming. Here, we propose a novel digital twin framework for livestock farming focusing on pig houses. Livestock farming is one of perspective areas where digital twins can provide benefits for the growth of livestock and their operation in an efficient manner. To validate effect of the proposed digital twin framework for a pig house, we perform various simulations using a real-world dataset of a pig house. As a result of analyzing the energy demands for heating in pigsty based on the digital twin framework, the fan-coil unit was found to be the most energy efficient. In addition, when the optimal control of the HVAC system was applied, it was found to be more energy efficient than the conventional control method. The results obtained in this study show that our approach is superior to existing operational conventions, particularly in terms of energy efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Livestock Farming; Digital Twin; Energy; Simulation; Climate Control; Energy Efficiency; Farms; Houses; Interactive Computer Systems; Mammals; Virtual Reality; Digital Livestock Farming; Energy; Farming; Livestock Farming; Pig House; Real - Time System; Simulation; Smart Agricultures; Real Time Systems","Climate control; Energy efficiency; Farms; Houses; Interactive computer systems; Mammals; Virtual reality; Digital livestock farming; Energy; Farming; Livestock farming; Pig house; Real - Time system; Simulation; Smart agricultures; Real time systems","","","","World Population Day 2022 Symposium Launch of United Nations World Population Prospects 2022; Farooq, Muhammad Shoaib, A Survey on the Role of IoT in Agriculture for the Implementation of Smart Farming, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 156237-156271, (2019); Farooq, Muhammad Shoaib, Internet of Things in Greenhouse Agriculture: A Survey on Enabling Technologies, Applications, and Protocols, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 53374-53397, (2022); Aker, Jenny C., The promise (and pitfalls) of ICT for agriculture initiatives, Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom), 47, pp. 35-48, (2016); International Journal of Computer Science and Mathematical Theory, (2017); Mat, Ibrahim, Smart agriculture using internet of things, pp. 54-59, (2018); Digital Twin Manufacturing Excellence Through Virtual Factory Replication, (2014); Costantino, Andrea, Energy Use for Climate Control of Animal Houses: The State of the Art in Europe, Energy Procedia, 101, pp. 184-191, (2016); Hu, Yuan'an, Environmental and human health challenges of industrial livestock and poultry farming in China and their mitigation, Environment International, 107, pp. 111-130, (2017); Aarnink, André J.André, Nutrition, key factor to reduce environmental load from pig production, Livestock Science, 109, 1-3, pp. 194-203, (2007)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171541964"

To ensure sustainable development and quality control of the inputs required by the industry, it is essential to monitor and classify the behavior of cattle. Sensor-based monitoring systems provide accurate information by capturing raw data and identifying behavior through machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This approach has allowed farmers to better understand the individual needs of their animals. This study presents a deep residual neural network for the classification of cattle behavior. The performance of the ResNeXt model was evaluated using a public real-world dataset collected from sensors attached to the neck of six different Japanese black beef cows. The experimental results showed that the presented ResNeXt model achieved the highest average accuracy of 94.96% and the highest average F1-score of 93.66%. Compared to other baseline deep learning models and the current state-of-the-art model for cattle behavior classification, the presented model outperformed them and achieved better performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Animal Activity Recognition; Cattle Behavior Classification; Deep Learning; Livestock; Wearable Sensor; Agriculture; Animals; Behavioral Research; Deep Learning; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Wearable Sensors; Activity Recognition; Animal Activities; Animal Activity Recognition; Behaviour Classification; Cattle Behavior Classification; High Productivity; Learning Approach; Livestock; Performance; Quality Control","Agriculture; Animals; Behavioral research; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Wearable sensors; Activity recognition; Animal activities; Animal activity recognition; Behaviour classification; Cattle behavior classification; High productivity; Learning approach; Livestock; Performance; Quality control","","","This research project was supported by Thailand Science Research and Innovation Fund; University of Phayao (Grant No. FF66-UoE001); National Science, Research and Innovation Fund (NSRF); and King Mongkut s University of Technology North Bangkok with Contract no.

During harvesting, fruit pickers pick fruit into wearable bags and empty these bags into harvesting bins located in the orchard. Once full, these bins are quickly transported to a cooled pack house to improve the shelf life of picked fruits. For farmers and managers, the knowledge of when a picker bag is emptied is important for managing harvesting bins more effectively to minimise the time the picked fruit is left out in the heat (resulting in reduced shelf life). We propose a means to detect these bag-emptying events using human activity recognition with wearable sensors and machine learning methods. We develop a semi-supervised approach to labelling the data. A feature-based machine learning ensemble model and a deep recurrent convolutional neural network are developed and tested on a real-world dataset.

Crops considered include maize, rice, wheat, and soybean. This dataset offers the plausible peak dates of sowing, emergence, maturity and harvesting as well as those of silking for maize, flowering for soybean, heading and flowering for wheat, and transplanting, heading and flowering for rice. Distinctions are made between fully irrigated and rainfed conditions and winter and spring wheat as well as between dry-and wet-season rice in the tropics.

EPPO codes are an easy way of referring to a specific organism by means of short 5 or 6 letter codes instead of long scientific names or ambiguous common names. EPPO codes are freely available in different formats through the EPPO Global Database platform and are implemented as a worldwide standard and used among scientists and experts in both industry and regulatory organizations. One of the large companies that adopted such codes is BASF, which uses them mainly in research and development to build their crop protection and seeds products. However, extracting the information is limited by fixed API calls or files that require additional processing steps. Facing these issues makes it difficult to use the available information flexibly, infer new data connections, or enrich it with external data sources. To overcome such limitations, BASF has developed an internal EPPO ontology to represent the list of codes provided by the EPPO Global Database as well as the regulatory categorization and relationship among them. This paper presents the development process of this ontology along with its enrichment process, which allows the reuse of relevant information available in an external knowledge source such as the NCBI Taxon. In addition, this paper describes the use and adoption of the EPPO ontology within the BASF's Agricultural Solutions division and the lessons learned during this work. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chemical Industry; Crop Protection; Diseases; Eppo Codes; Ontologies; Pests; Plants; Seeds","","","","We would like to thank Alexander García Castro for the conceptualization of the EPPO ontology development.","Alomar, Òscar, Development and testing of the media monitoring tool MedISys for early identification and reporting of existing and emerging plant health threats, EPPO Bulletin, 45, 2, pp. 288-293, (2015); Efsa Supporting Publications, (2016); Ncbitaxon Ontology, (2013); Chávez-Feria, Serge, Chowlk: from UML-Based Ontology Conceptualizations to OWL, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 13261 LNCS, pp. 338-352, (2022); Cooper, Laurel D., The plant ontology as a tool for comparative plant anatomy and genomic analyses, Plant and Cell Physiology, 54, 2, (2013); Côté, Richard G., The Ontology Lookup Service, a lightweight cross-platform tool for controlled vocabulary queries, BMC Bioinformatics, 7, (2006); Iobc Wprs Bull, (2017); Integrated Food Ontology Workshop Ifow 21 at the 12th International Conference on Biomedical Ontologies Icbo, (2021); Horizon Scanning for Plant Health Report on 2017 2020 Activities, (2021); tPP 1/248 (3) Harmonized system for classification and coding of the uses of plant protection products, EPPO Bulletin, 52, 1, pp. 17-24, (2022)","","Frontiers Media SA","","","","","","26248212","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164381109"

However, deep learning models pose some challenges in the learning process. It is computationally intensive to train deep learning networks and also resource-intensive. Therefore, it cannot be applicable in limited-resource devices. Limited research is being done on the implementation of efficient approaches for real-world problems. This study tries to bridge the gaps towards an applicable system in the real world especially in the agricultural sector for plants disease management and fruits classification. We introduce a novel deep learning architecture called LightNet. LightNet is an architecture that employs two strategies to achieve the sparsity of DenseNet: the skip connections and pruning strategy. The resultant is a small network with reduced parameters and model size. LightNet model matches the performance of the highest accuracy of DenseNet. Moreover, LightNet is × 2 smaller, × 2 parameters efficient and × 3 faster compared original DenseNet. The model is evaluated on the real-worlds dataset PlantsVillage and Fruits-360.

Genome duplications are an important mechanism to enable plant adaptation. This leads to characteristic footprints in the genome, such as protein family expansion. We explore genetic diversity and uncover evolutionary adaptation to stresses by exploiting genome comparisons between stress tolerant and sensitive species and RNA-Seq data sets from stress experiments. Expanded gene families that are stress-responsive based on differential expression analysis could hint at species or clade-specific adaptation, making these gene families exciting candidates for follow-up tolerance studies and crop improvement. Software: Integration of such cross-species omics data is a challenging task, requiring various steps of transformation and filtering. Ultimately, visualization is crucial for quality control and interpretation. To address this, we developed A2TEA: Automated Assessment of Trait-specific Evolutionary Adaptations, a Snakemake workflow for detecting adaptation footprints in silico. It functions as a one-stop processing pipeline, integrating protein family, phylogeny, expression, and protein function analyses. The pipeline is accompanied by an R Shiny web application that allows exploring, highlighting, and exporting the results interactively. This allows the user to formulate hypotheses regarding the genomic adaptations of one or a subset of the investigated species to a given stress. Conclusions: While our research focus is on crops, the pipeline is entirely independent of the underlying species and can be used with any set of species. We demonstrate pipeline efficiency on real-world datasets and discuss the implementation and limits of our analysis workflow as well as planned extensions to its current state.

Flood prediction offers a huge challenge for researchers struggling to predict floods since long time. In this article, flood forecasting model using federated learning technique has been proposed. Federated Learning is the most advanced technique of machine learning (ML) that guarantees data privacy, ensures data availability, promises data security, and handles network latency trials inherent in prediction of floods by prohibiting data to be transferred over the network for model training. Federated Learning technique urges for onsite training of local data models, and focuses on transmission of these local models on the network instead of sending huge data set towards central server for local model aggregation and training of global data model at the central server. In this article, the proposed model integrates locally trained models of eighteen clients, investigates at which station flooding is about to happen and generates flood alert towards a specific client with five days lead time. A local feed forward neural network (FFNN) model is trained at the client station where the flood has been expected. Flood forecasting module of local FFNN model predicts the expected water level by taking multiple regional parameters as input. The dataset of five different rivers and barrages has been collected from 2015 to 2021 considering four aspects including snow melting, rainfall-runoff, flow routing and hydrodynamics. The proposed flood forecasting model has successfully predicted previous floods happened in the selected zone during 2010 to 2015 with 84 % accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Federated Learning; Feed-forward Neural Network; Flood Forecasting System; Hydraulic; Meteorological; Data Privacy; Disasters; Feedforward Neural Networks; Flood Control; Hydraulics; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Water Levels; Weather Forecasting; Federated Learning; Feed Forward Neural Net Works; Flood Forecasting; Flood Forecasting Models; Flood Forecasting System; Forecasting System; Learning Techniques; Meteorological; Predictive Models; Floods","Data privacy; Disasters; Feedforward neural networks; Flood control; Hydraulics; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Water levels; Weather forecasting; Federated learning; Feed forward neural net works; Flood forecasting; Flood forecasting models; Flood forecasting system; Forecasting system; Learning techniques; Meteorological; Predictive models; Floods","","","","Floods World Health Organization, (2022); Patro, Shivananda, Hydrodynamic modelling of a large flood-prone river system in India with limited data, Hydrological Processes, 23, 19, pp. 2774-2791, (2009); Mountain Hazards and Disaster Risk Reduction, (2015); Rahman, Atta Ur, Analysis of 2010-flood causes, nature and magnitude in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, Natural Hazards, 66, 2, pp. 887-904, (2013); Terti, Galateia, Dynamic vulnerability factors for impact-based flash flood prediction, Natural Hazards, 79, 3, pp. 1481-1497, (2015); Annu Flood Rep, (2022); Martinez, Maria, Innovative Techniques in the Context of Actions for Flood Risk Management: A Review, Eng, 2, 1, pp. 1-11, (2021); Chan, N.

Many studies have been conducted to improve our understanding of the emission processes and to identify influential variables in order to develop mitigation techniques adapted to each manure management step (animal housing, outdoor storage, and manure spreading to land). The international project DATAMAN (http://www.dataman.co.nz) aims to develop a global database on greenhouse gases (N<inf>2</inf>O, CH<inf>4</inf>) and NH<inf>3</inf> emissions from the manure management chain to refine emission factors (EFs) for national greenhouse gas and NH<inf>3</inf> inventories. This paper describes the housing and outdoor storage components of this database. Relevant information for different animal categories, manure types, livestock buildings, outdoor storage, and climatic conditions was collated from published peer reviewed research, conference papers, and existing databases published between 1995 and 2021. In the housing database, 2024 EFs were collated (63% for NH<inf>3</inf>, 19.5% for CH<inf>4</inf>, and 17.5% for N<inf>2</inf>O). The storage database contains 654 NH<inf>3</inf> EFs from 16 countries, 243 CH<inf>4</inf> EFs from 13 countries, and 421 N<inf>2</inf>O EFs from 17 countries. Across all gases, dairy cattle and swine production in temperate climate zones are the most represented animal and climate categories. As for the housing database, the number of EFs for the tropical climate zone is under-represented. The DATAMAN database can be used for the refinement of national inventories and better assessment of the cost-effectiveness of a range of mitigation strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ammonia; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Ammonia; Greenhouse Gases; Manure; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Ammonia; Animals; Cost Effectiveness; Digital Storage; Fertilizers; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Housing; Manures; Methane; Nitrogen Oxides; Ammonia Emissions; Ch 4; Emission Factors; Global Database; Greenhouses Gas; Housing Database; Livestock Housing; Livestock Manure; Manure Management; Nitrous Oxide Emissions; Database Systems; Ammonia; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Agricultural Waste; Air Pollution Control; Ammonia Formation; Animal Experiment; Animal Housing; Article; Carbon Footprint; Climate; Conference Paper; Controlled Study; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Dairy Cattle; Data Base; Geographic Distribution; Greenhouse Gas Emission; Livestock; Methane Emission; Mitigation; Nitrous Oxide Emission; Nonhuman; Peer Review; Pig; Poultry Manure; Storage; Waste Management; Animal; Bovine; Greenhouse Gas; Manure; Cattle; Greenhouse Gases; Housing, Animal; Livestock; Manure; Nitrous Oxide; Swine","Ammonia; Animals; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Manures; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Ammonia emissions; CH 4; Emission factors; Global database; Greenhouses gas; Housing database; Livestock housing; Livestock manure; Manure management; Nitrous oxide emissions; Database systems; ammonia; methane; nitrous oxide; agricultural waste; air pollution control; ammonia formation; animal experiment; animal housing; Article; carbon footprint; climate; conference paper; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; dairy cattle; data base; geographic distribution; greenhouse gas emission; livestock; methane emission; mitigation; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; peer review; pig; poultry manure; storage; waste management; animal; bovine; greenhouse gas; manure; Cattle; Greenhouse Gases; Housing, Animal; Livestock; Manure; Nitrous Oxide; Swine","","ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Ammonia; Greenhouse Gases; Manure; Methane; Nitrous Oxide","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the New Zealand Government in support of the objectives of the Livestock Research Group of the Global Research Alliance (GRA); the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Defra (UK); National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE); and individual European funding organizations in support of the MELS project \u201CMitigating greenhouse gas Emissions from Livestock Systems\u201D (ID: 39258) within the framework of the Joint Call of ERA\u2010NETs SusAn, FACCE ERA\u2010GAS, and ICT\u2010AGRI 2.

This study investigates the contributions of different climatic and socio-economic variables to agricultural drought in Jharkhand. The three primary criteria, i.e., exposure (E), sensitivity (S), and adaptive capacity (AC), responsible for agricultural drought vulnerability, were examined to identify the drought-prone areas. Long-term (1958–2020) gridded climatic datasets obtained from the Terra-climate global dataset, MODIS vegetation index dataset (MOD13Q1) for the years 2001–2020, different soil parameters obtained from the ISRIC global soil database and state agricultural portal of Jharkhand, and different socio-economic datasets obtained from census data (2011) provided by Govt. of India, were utilized for this study. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to estimate the weighted contribution of the indicator variables falling under each criterion (E, S, and AC), and three criteria index maps were generated. These separate maps were further integrated to generate the final vulnerability index map. Finally, the study area was categorized into different zones based on the drought vulnerability index value ranging from 0 to 1, according to the severity of the drought. It was observed that about 4.05%, 28.12%, and 37.07% of the total geographical area is very highly, highly, and moderately vulnerable to agricultural drought, respectively. Amongst the three primary criteria, exposure showed a significant positive correlation (R = 0.61), and sensitivity showed a strong positive correlation (R = 0.55) with vulnerability. The adaptive capacity was negatively correlated (R = −0.75) with the vulnerability. However, putting equal weights to the variables to calculate the vulnerability, the exposure and sensitivity indicators showed a significant positive correlation with the vulnerability, with an R-value of 0.82 and 0.79, respectively. In contrast, the adaptive capacity showed a negative correlation with the vulnerability with R = −0.75. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Drought Vulnerability; Ahp; Climate Change; Socio-economic Influence; Soil; Agriculture; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Drought; Economic Analysis; Economic And Social Effects; Food Supply; Hierarchical Systems; Maps; Population Statistics; Adaptive Capacity; Agricultural Drought; Agricultural Drought Vulnerability; Environmental Hazards; Food Production; Index Maps; Positive Correlations; Socio-economic Influence; Socio-economics; Vulnerability Index; Climate Change; Agricultural Production; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Climate Change; Correlation; Data Set; Drought; Mapping Method; Modis; Socioeconomic Conditions; Terra (satellite); Vegetation Index; Vulnerability; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Article; Controlled Study; Jharkhand; Soil Property; Vegetation; Agriculture; Environmental Monitoring; Socioeconomics; Soil; India; Climate Change; Droughts; Environmental Monitoring; Socioeconomic Factors; Soil","Agriculture; Analytic hierarchy process; Drought; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Hierarchical systems; Maps; Population statistics; Adaptive capacity; Agricultural drought; Agricultural drought vulnerability; Environmental hazards; Food production; Index maps; Positive correlations; Socio-economic influence; Socio-economics; Vulnerability index; Climate change; agricultural production; analytical hierarchy process; climate change; correlation; data set; drought; mapping method; MODIS; socioeconomic conditions; Terra (satellite); vegetation index; vulnerability; analytic hierarchy process; article; controlled study; Jharkhand; soil property; vegetation; agriculture; environmental monitoring; socioeconomics; soil; India; Climate Change; Droughts; Environmental Monitoring; Socioeconomic Factors; Soil","","Soil","The authors would like to thank BIT, Mesra, for pursuing this research.

In Shaanxi province, central China, frequently affected by rebellions and natural disasters over the past 300 years, the cropland area fluctuated. In this study, based on local gazetteers, statistics, and survey data, systematic steps are followed to reconstruct the cropland area change since 1650 in Shaanxi province. The result shows four stages of changes in the total cropland area: steady increase during 1650–1830 stimulated by policies and population growth, decrease during 1830–1937 affected by wars and natural disasters, rapid growth during 1937–the 1980s, and rapid decrease after the 1980s influenced by urbanization and the agricultural planting structure adjustment. The total cropland area increased from 2.2 × 104 km2 in 1650 to 3.99 × 104 km2 in 2016. The majority of the cropland concentrated on the Guanzhong region from 1650 to 2016. The cropland expanded from the center to the surroundings in the Guanzhong region, from northeastern to southwestern in northern Shaanxi, and from western to eastern in southern Shaanxi before the 1980s. Cropland area declined in all three regions after the 1980s. The comparisons show most cropland area data in the Qing dynasty from the existing regional studies are still highly dependent on the registered tax-paying cropland area. Without considering agricultural history, changes in the SAGE cropland in Shaanxi province over the past 300 years are irrational. Spatially, HYDE 3.2 dataset cannot show the “real” spatial distribution of the cropland before 1930, because too much cropland is allocated to northern and southern Shaanxi. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cropland Reconstruction; Historical Documents; Shaanxi Province; Spatial-temporal Change; Agricultural Land; Reconstruction; Spatial Distribution; Spatial Variation; Temporal Variation; China; Shaanxi","agricultural land; reconstruction; spatial distribution; spatial variation; temporal variation; China; Shaanxi","","","This study is jointly funded by National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2019YFC0507801 ), NSFC Project (Nos. 41807433 , 41972193 ), and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20180804 ).","Van Bodegom, Peter Michiel, A fully traits-based approach to modeling global vegetation distribution, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111, 38, pp. 13733-13738, (2014); Land Utilization in China, (1937); Cao, Xue, Research on cropland data recovery and reconstruction in the Qing Dynasty: Method and case study, Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica, 68, 2, pp. 245-256, (2013); Cao, Xue, Reconstruction and change analysis of cropland data of China in recent 300 years, Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica, 69, 7, pp. 896-906, (2014); undefined, (1990); Chen, Hai, Land cover and landscape changes in Shaanxi Province during China’s Grain for Green Program (2000–2010), Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 187, 10, (2015); Claussen, Martin, Late Quaternary vegetation-climate feedbacks, Climate of the Past, 5, 2, pp. 203-216, (2009); Famine Relief History in China, (2012); Writing Publishing and Reading Local Gazetteers in Imperial China 1100 1700, (2015); Ellis, Erle Christopher, People have shaped most of terrestrial nature for at least 12,000 years, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 17, (2021)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","10406182","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125746043"

However, our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological drivers of successful host adaptation, expansion, and dissemination are limited. Staphylococcus aureus is a major bacterial pathogen of humans and a leading cause of mastitis in dairy cows worldwide. Here we trace the evolutionary history of bovine S. aureus using a global dataset of 10,254 S. aureus genomes including 1,896 bovine isolates from 32 countries in 6 continents. We identified 7 major contemporary endemic clones of S. aureus causing bovine mastitis around the world and traced them back to 4 independent host-jump events from humans that occurred up to 2,500 y ago. Individual clones emerged and underwent clonal expansion from the mid-19th to late 20th century coinciding with the commercialization and industrialization of dairy farming, and older lineages have become globally distributed via established cattle trade links. Importantly, we identified lineage-dependent differences in the frequency of host transmission events between humans and cows in both directions revealing high risk clones threatening veterinary and human health. Finally, pangenome network analysis revealed that some bovine S. aureus lineages contained distinct sets of bovine-associated genes, consistent with multiple trajectories to host adaptation via gene acquisition.

Researchers have been working on a number of visual processing and machine intelligence algorithms to handle this type of data as efficiently as feasible. Deep learning approaches have advanced significantly in the field of machine vision, which is also having a big impact on the analysis of hyperspectral data. To increase its discriminative potential for HI classification, this work suggests a powerful 3D-CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) architecture, where the shallow features extracted using 1D-EWT (Empirical Wavelet Transform) are served as input, and the ultimate output of the CNN are projected class-related outcomes. The framework is known as PEC, where P stands for PCA, E for 1D-EWT, and C for 3D-CNN model. Prior to features extraction, the HI undergoes spectral dimension reduction via Principal Component Anaalysis (PCA). To forecast segmentation for a volumetric area of a 3D HI sample, 3D CNNs use 3D convolutional kernels. The usage of more parameters by these CNNs means that the ability to employ interslice context that can boost performance. The CNN model’s parameters are optimised using a limited training set. The newly proposed PEC framework achieves a considerable overall accuracy of 99.58% and 99.94% (percentage increase of 0.08% and 0.54%) and Kappa score of 99.51% and 99.92 (percentage increase of 1.5% and 0.8%) compared to similar approaches for two real-world data sets IP and PU respectively with 30% training samples. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1d-ewt (empirical Wavelet Transform); 3d-cnn (convolutional Neural Network); Hyperspectral Images (his); Pec Framework; Principal Component Analysis (pca); Image Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Spectral Analysis; Three-dimensional Modeling; Wavelet Analysis","image analysis; principal component analysis; spectral analysis; three-dimensional modeling; wavelet analysis","","","","Alberg, Anthony J., The use of ""overall accuracy"" to evaluate the validity of screening or diagnostic tests, Journal of General Internal Medicine, 19, 5 PART 1, pp. 460-465, (2004); Bai, Jun, Semisupervised pair-wise band selection for hyperspectral images, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 8, 6, pp. 2798-2813, (2015); Ben Hamida, Amina, 3-D deep learning approach for remote sensing image classification, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 56, 8, pp. 4420-4434, (2018); Carvalho, Vinícius Rezende, Evaluating five different adaptive decomposition methods for EEG signal seizure detection and classification, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 62, (2020); Chang, Chgein I., A joint band prioritization and banddecorrelation approach to band selection for hyperspectral image classification, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 37, 6, pp. 2631-2641, (1999); Demir, Begüm M., Empirical mode decomposition of hyperspectral images for support vector machine classification, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 48, 11, pp. 4071-4084, (2010); Demir, Begüm M., Empirical mode decomposition pre-process for higher accuracy hyperspectral image classification, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2, 1, pp. II939-II941, (2008); Druzhkov, Pavel N., A survey of deep learning methods and software tools for image classification and object detection, Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis, 26, 1, pp. 9-15, (2016); Analysis of Pca Algorithms in Distributed Environments, (2015); Ertürk, Alp, Hyperspectral image classification using empirical mode decomposition with spectral gradient enhancement, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 51, 5, pp. 2787-2798, (2013)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","18650481; 18650473","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140263670"

Recently, demands for applying machine learning (ML) methods to improve the knowledge and understanding of soil behavior have increased. While real-world datasets are inherently imbalanced, ML models overestimate the majority classes and underestimate the minority ones. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of imbalance in training data on the performance of a random forest model (RF). The original dataset (imbalanced) included 6100 soil texture data from the surface layer of agricultural fields in northern Iran. A synthetic resampling approach using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to make a balanced dataset from the original data. Bioclimatic and remotely sensed data, distance, and terrain attributes were used as environmental covariates to model and map soil textural classes. Results showed that based on mean minimal depth (MMD), when imbalanced data was used, distance and annual mean precipitation were important, but when balanced data were employed, terrain attributes and remotely sensed data played a key role in predicting soil texture. Balanced data also improved the accuracies from 44% to 59% and 0.30 to 0.52 with regard to the overall accuracy and kappa values, respectively. Similar increasing trends were observed for the recall and F-scores. It is concluded that, in modeling soil texture classes using RF models through a digital soil mapping approach, data should be balanced before modeling. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Resampling; Digital Soil Mapping; Imbalance Classification; Iran; Machine Learning; Soil Particle Size Fraction","","","","The authors would like to thank the Soil and Water Research Institute (SWRI) for providing opportunities for this research.

Despite their ecological and economic importance, it is likely that pests go unreported in many regions. Using a global dataset of tree pests and multiple metrics of pest diversity standardized for host availability, we describe the biogeography of under-reporting and reveal potential for future pest invasions. Location: Global. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Pathogens, insect pests and native tree hosts. Methods: We assembled the global distributions of 3,828 tree pests and 2,689 host tree species across 226 countries, and calculated two metrics of pest diversity that account for host availability: pest saturation (i.e., the proportion of the known pests of native host trees present with countries) and pest deficit (the number of known pests of native trees that have not yet been reported in countries). We used Bayesian regression models to identify how sampling, socio-economic variables, climate and ecological drivers affect estimates of pest saturation and deficit. Results: We show that most countries are reported to have fewer than 50% of the pests for which native hosts are available—corresponding to hundreds of additional pest species per country. Pest saturation was lowest in Africa and central Asia, while pest deficit was highest in eastern Europe. Accounting for research output, pest saturation was higher in warmer and wetter countries, while pest deficit was highest in countries with greater host phylogenetic diversity. Low saturation and high deficit even in well-documented countries suggest a considerable potential for pest range expansion if barriers to dispersal are lowered. Main conclusions: Our findings indicate that, although all countries could potentially host additional pests, countries with low research output and high host diversity should be prioritized for future pest discovery and surveillance to ensure timely detection and implementation of pest mitigation strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Invasive Species; Plant Diseases; Plant Insects; Plant-pest Interaction; Tree Diversity; Undiscovered Diversity; Biogeography; Disease; Interspecific Interaction; Invasive Species; Pest Outbreak; Pest Species; Species Diversity; Vulnerability","biogeography; disease; interspecific interaction; invasive species; pest outbreak; pest species; species diversity; vulnerability","","","","Bahram, Mohammad, Structure and function of the global topsoil microbiome, Nature, 560, 7717, pp. 233-237, (2018); Bebber, Daniel Patrick, Many unreported crop pests and pathogens are probably already present, Global Change Biology, 25, 8, pp. 2703-2713, (2019); Bebber, Daniel Patrick, The global spread of crop pests and pathogens, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 23, 12, pp. 1398-1407, (2014); Bebber, Daniel Patrick, Economic and physical determinants of the global distributions of crop pests and pathogens, New Phytologist, 202, 3, pp. 901-910, (2014); Beech, Emily, GlobalTreeSearch: The first complete global database of tree species and country distributions, Journal of Sustainable Forestry, 36, 5, pp. 454-489, (2017); Bivand, Roger S., Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R: Second Edition, pp. 1-405, (2013); Bürkner, Paul Christian, brms: An R package for Bayesian multilevel models using Stan, Journal of Statistical Software, 80, (2017); Cabi Crop Protection Compendium; Carpenter, Bob, Stan: A probabilistic programming language, Journal of Statistical Software, 76, 1, (2017); Castello, John D., Pathogens, patterns, and processes in forest ecosystems, BioScience, 45, 1, pp. 16-24, (1995)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","1466822X; 14668238","","GEBIF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135519660"

Evaluating the reliability of existing global LUCC datasets is a precondition for improved data quality. In this study, based on the regional historical document-based reconstructions, satellite-based data, and historical reclamation evidence for the Xinjiang area of China, the accuracy and rationality of cropland data for this area in the HYDE 3.2 and SAGE datasets were evaluated by utilizing comparative analysis regarding three aspects, namely the change tendency of the cropland area, the area of cropland, and the differences in spatial pattern. This study concluded that the amount of cropland in the Xinjiang area in the global and regional datasets shows both disparate trends and large differences in absolute values. Spatially, historical reclamation evidence indicated that agricultural cultivation in the Xinjiang area underwent expansion from south to north and from east to west over the past 300 years; however, the global datasets revealed that the cropland spatial patterns in the Xinjiang area in the historical period are similar to those in the current period. These differences are attributable to the uncertainties of the basic assumptions, per capita cropland area estimates, and reconstruction methods in the global datasets.

Local decision makers therefore need reliable long-term hydro-meteorological forecasts to support the seasonal management of water resources, reservoir operations and agriculture. In this context, an Ensemble Kalman Filter framework is applied to predict sub-basin-scale runoff employing global freely available datasets of reanalysis precipitation (ERA5-Land) as well as bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated seasonal forecasts (SEAS5-BCSD). Runoff is estimated using least squares predictions, exploiting the covariance structures between runoff and precipitation. The performance of the assimilation framework was assessed using different ensemble skill scores. New hydrological insights for the region: Our results show that the quality of runoff predictions are closely linked to the performance of the rainfall seasonal predictions and allows skillful predictions up to two months ahead in most sub-basins. The anthropogenic conditions such as in the Western Bahia state, however, must be taken under consideration, since non-stationary runoff time-series have poorer skill as such unnatural variations can not be captured by long-term covariances. In sub-basins which are dominated by little anthropogenic influence, the presented framework provides a promising and easily transferable approach for skillful operational seasonal runoff predictions on sub-basin scale. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data-assimilation; Hydro-meteorology; River Basin Management; Seasonal Forecast","","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for the SaWaM project (Seasonal Water Resources Management: Regionalized Global Data and Transfer to Practice) under the financial assistance agreement No 02WGR1421.

We conducted year-long sampling of 59 sites in a nested-catchment design in the Mara River, Kenya in which fluxes were quantified and their underlying controls assessed. We estimated annual basin-scale greenhouse gas emissions from measured in-stream gas concentrations, modeled gas transfer velocities, and determined the sensitivity of up-scaling to discharge. Based on the total annual CO<inf>2</inf>-equivalent emissions calculated from global warming potentials (GWP), the Mara basin was a net greenhouse gas source (294 ± 35 Gg CO<inf>2</inf> eq yr−1). Lower-order streams (1–3) contributed 81% of the total fluxes, and higher stream orders (4–8) contributed 19%. Cropland-draining streams also exhibited higher fluxes compared to forested streams. Seasonality in stream discharge affected stream widths (and stream area) and gas exchange rates, strongly influencing the basin-wide annual flux, which was 10 times higher during the high and medium discharge periods than the low discharge period. The basin-wide estimate was underestimated by up to 36% if discharge was ignored, and up to 37% for lower stream orders. Future research should therefore include seasonality in stream surface areas in upscaling procedures to better constrain basin-wide fluxes. Given that agricultural activities are a major factor increasing riverine greenhouse gas fluxes in the study region, increased conversion of forests and agricultural intensification has the possibility of increasing the contribution of the African continent to global greenhouse gas sources. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Intensification; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gas; Land Cover; Land Use Change; River Discharge; Seasonality; Upscaling; Mara River","agricultural intensification; global warming; greenhouse gas; land cover; land use change; river discharge; seasonality; upscaling; Mara River","","","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the German academic exchange service (DAAD) as part of R.M.'s doctoral studies.

In the context of tourism-driven economic potential areas, these drivers have greater effects, including threatening groundwater availability. This study assessed the combined impacts of climate and land use changes on the groundwater recharge (GWR) in Siem Reap, Cambodia utilizing Phase Six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) global climate models (GCMs), DynaCLUE land-use model, and Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Three climate models CanESM5, EC_Earth3, and MIROC6, out of seven, best captured the observed data after performance evaluation through the entropy method, were bias-corrected linearly for two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) - SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. The results indicate a general increase in precipitation under both SSPs, while the average annual maximum temperature is likely to increase by 0.024 °C/year and 0.049 °C/year under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. A similar trend but relatively higher increase is expected for the minimum temperature. Furthermore, the historical land use change showed the expansion of urban settlement by 373% between 2004 and 2019 at the expense of forest and shrubland. Future land use projections from the DynaCLUE model show that the urban settlements in the study area are likely to expand, from their 2019 condition, by 55% in 2030, 209% in 2060, and 369% in 2090 under SSP2 and at double of these rates under SSP5 scenario. The GWR is expected to rise by 39–53% during the wet season and decrease by 13–29% during the dry season under both scenarios. Meanwhile, under constant land use, the GWR is likely to increase more compared to other scenarios, highlighting the importance of land use planning to policymakers and planners. Additionally, the study shall also be important to practitioners and researchers in understanding, planning, and evaluating the performance of multiple climate models in groundwater assessment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cmip6; Dynaclue; Global Datasets; Groundwater Recharge; Ssps; Swat; Fresh Water; Ground Water; Rain; Climate Change; Groundwater; Land Use Change; Socioeconomic Impact; Agricultural Land; Article; Cambodia; Climate Model; Dry Season; Entropy; Forest; Global Climate; Grassland; Hydrological Model; Land Use; Meteorology; Precipitation; Rainy Season; Scrub; Soil And Water Assessment Tool Model; Temperature; Water Supply; Wetland; Socioeconomics; Urbanization; Climate Change; Groundwater; Socioeconomic Factors; Urbanization","fresh water; ground water; rain; climate change; groundwater; land use change; socioeconomic impact; agricultural land; Article; Cambodia; climate model; dry season; entropy; forest; global climate; grassland; hydrological model; land use; meteorology; precipitation; rainy season; scrub; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; temperature; water supply; wetland; socioeconomics; urbanization; Climate Change; Groundwater; Socioeconomic Factors; Urbanization","","","Funding text 1: Research grant was received from Kurita Water and Environment Foundation (KWEF), Japan.This paper forms part of the first author's research work for a master's degree in Water Engineering and Management, School of Engineering and Technology, Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand.

However, the amount of carbon that can be potentially added to the soil is still being debated, and there is a lack of information on additional storage potential on global cropland. Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential is region-specific and conditioned by climate and management but most global estimates use fixed accumulation rates or time frames. In this study, we model SOC storage potential as a function of climate, land cover and soil. We used 83,416 SOC observations from global databases and developed a quantile regression neural network to quantify the SOC variation within soils with similar environmental characteristics. This allows us to identify similar areas that present higher SOC with the difference representing an additional storage potential. We estimated that the topsoils (0-30 cm) of global croplands (1,410 million hectares) hold 83 Pg C. The additional SOC storage potential in the topsoil of global croplands ranges from 29 to 65 Pg C. These values only equate to three to seven years of global emissions, potentially offsetting 35% of agriculture's 85 Pg historical carbon debt estimate due to conversion from natural ecosystems. As SOC store is temperature-dependent, this potential is likely to reduce by 14% by 2040 due to climate change in a ''business as usual'' scenario.

Some strategies to promote sustainability include reducing inputs, substituting conventional crops with genetically modified (GM) alternatives, and using organic production. Here, we leveraged global databases covering 121 countries to determine which farming strategies—the amount of inputs per area (fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation), GM crops, and percent agriculture in organic production—are most correlated with 12 sustainability metrics recognized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Using quantile regression, we found that countries with higher Human Development Indices (HDI) (including education, income, and lifespan), higher-income equality, lower food insecurity, and higher cereal yields had the most organic production and inputs. However, input-intensive strategies were associated with greater agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, countries with more GM crops were last on track to meeting the SDG of reduced inequalities. Using a longitudinal analysis spanning 2004–2018, we found that countries were generally decreasing inputs and increasing their share of agriculture in organic production. Also, in disentangling correlation vs. causation, we hypothesize that a country's development is more likely to drive changes in agricultural strategies than vice versa. Altogether, our correlative analyses suggest that countries with greater progress toward the SDGs of no poverty, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, decent work, economic growth, and reduced inequalities had the highest production of organic agriculture and, to a lesser extent, intensive use of inputs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Genetically Modified Crops; Input-intensive; Organic Agriculture; Social-ecological Systems; Sustainable Development Goals","","","","Funding text 1: The page charges were funded by start-up money awarded to Tobin Northfield from Washington State University Department of Entomology.; Funding text 2: B.

However, the continent lacks technological advancement. Therefore, there is a need to apply global data and open geospatial tools for analysis to prevent, stop and comprehend the trend and effects of land degradation, food insecurity and the unsustainability of cities. The study takes three representative indicators (climate risk, land degradation and land consumption) from FAO’s four strategic better’s to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of global datasets to support decision makers. Three representative cities in Africa are selected for the study—Houet, Burkina Faso (West Africa); Kisumu, Kenya (East Africa); and Analamanga, Madagascar (South East Africa). The study found that eight Fokontany of the Analamanga region were at high risk from climate change; at the ward level, a maximum of 54.2% of the total degraded land area in Kisumu; and maximum land-consumption rate of 1.5 was found in Houet at the department level.

At the field level, NO3 leaching is highly variable due to interactions among soil, weather and crop management factors, but the relative effects of these drivers have not been quantified on a global scale. Using a global database of 82 field studies in temperate rainfed cereal crops with 961 observations, our objectives were to (a) quantify the relative importance of environmental and management variables to identify key leverage points for NO3 mitigation and (b) determine associated changes in crop productivity and potential tradeoffs for high and low NO3 loss scenarios. Machine learning algorithms (XGboost) and feature importance analysis showed that the amount and intensity of rainfall explained the most variability in NO3 leaching (up to 24 kg N ha-1), followed by nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate and crop N removal. In contrast, other soil and management variables such as soil texture, crop type, tillage and N source, timing and placement had less importance. To reduce N losses from global agriculture under changing weather and climatic conditions, these results highlight the need for better targeting and increased adoption of science-based, locally adapted management practices for improving N use efficiency. Future policy discussions should support this transition through different instruments while also promoting more advanced weather prediction analytics, especially in areas susceptible to extreme climatic variation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Climate Change; Fertilizer; Nitrate Leaching; Nitrogen; Climate Change; Crops; Ecosystems; Environmental Management; Groundwater; Groundwater Pollution; Leaching; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Nitrogen Fertilizers; Nitrogen Removal; Soil Pollution; Soils; Textures; Cereal Crop; Ecosystem Degradation; Field Level; Freshwater Ecosystem; Groundwater Contamination; Nitrate Leaching; Nitrate Leaching Loss; Primary Sources; Rainfed; Soil Management; Nitrates; Algorithm; Cereal; Crop Production; Leaching; Nitrate; Rainfall","Climate change; Crops; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Leaching; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen removal; Soil pollution; Soils; Textures; Cereal crop; Ecosystem degradation; Field level; Freshwater ecosystem; Groundwater contamination; Nitrate leaching; Nitrate leaching loss; Primary sources; Rainfed; Soil management; Nitrates; algorithm; cereal; crop production; leaching; nitrate; rainfall","","","","Abendroth, Lori J., Lengthening of maize maturity time is not a widespread climate change adaptation strategy in the US Midwest, Global Change Biology, 27, 11, pp. 2426-2440, (2021); Andrade, Renata, Assessing models for prediction of some soil chemical properties from portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry data in Brazilian Coastal Plains, Geoderma, 357, (2020); Andraski, Todd W., Using the presidedress soil nitrate test and organic nitrogen crediting to improve corn nitrogen recommendations, Agronomy Journal, 94, 6, pp. 1411-1418, (2002); Apley, Daniel W., Visualizing the effects of predictor variables in black box supervised learning models, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Currently, several global datasets of vegetation production are available at coarse or moderate spatial resolutions, but globally they still have large uncertainties, which hindered the application of GPP, especially in strongly heterogeneous agriculture ecosystems and mountainous areas. Here, we used the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach with the footprints of FLUXNET data to optimize the parameters of the high resolution of Global LAnd Surface Satellite (Hi-GLASS) GPP algorithm (i.e., the revised EC-LUE model) using 30 m spatial resolution Landsat data as driving data. Then, we generated a new set of algorithm parameters for high resolution GPP estimates. We used the optimized parameters with integrating footprint to calculate Hi-GLASS GPP based on Landsat data and our results revealed that on average, Hi-GLASS GPP explained 76% of variance in tower GPP at the total of 78 sites across ten vegetation types. Moreover, compared with previous 500 m GPP product such as GLASS GPP and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP, our optimized Hi-GLASS algorithm using Landsat data had large superiority in simulating GPP for wetlands, savannas, shrubland and C3, C4 cropland ecosystems, and had a slightly improvement for deciduous broadleaf forests and evergreen broadleaf forest ecosystem. Our study is an effort to optimize and quantify parameter uncertainty of Hi-GLASS algorithm using high spatial resolution (30 m) Landsat data and improve the high resolution GPP estimation for better understanding global ecosystem carbon dynamics and carbon-climate feedbacks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Footprints; Gross Primary Production; High Resolution; Landsat; Light Use Efficiency; Remote Sensing","","","","","Bagnara, Maurizio, Bayesian optimization of a light use efficiency model for the estimation of daily gross primary productivity in a range of Italian forest ecosystems, Ecological Modelling, 306, pp. 57-66, (2015); Beer, Christian, Terrestrial gross carbon dioxide uptake: Global distribution and covariation with climate, Science, 329, 5993, pp. 834-838, (2010); Cai, Zhanzhang, Modelling daily gross primary productivity with sentinel-2 data in the nordic region–comparison with data from modis, Remote Sensing, 13, 3, pp. 1-18, (2021); Chen, Baozhang, A data-model fusion approach for upscaling gross ecosystem productivity to the landscape scale based on remote sensing and flux footprint modelling, Biogeosciences, 7, 9, pp. 2943-2958, (2010); Cosh, Michael H., Microscale structural aspects of vegetation density variability, Journal of Hydrology, 276, 1-4, pp. 128-136, (2003); Dong, Jie, Early-season mapping of winter wheat in China based on Landsat and Sentinel images, Earth System Science Data, 12, 4, pp. 3081-3095, (2020); Friend, Andrew D., FLUXNET and modelling the global carbon cycle, Global Change Biology, 13, 3, pp. 610-633, (2007); He, Mingzhu, Regional crop gross primary productivity and yield estimation using fused landsat-MODIS data, Remote Sensing, 10, 3, (2018); Heimann, Martin, Terrestrial ecosystem carbon dynamics and climate feedbacks, Nature, 451, 7176, pp. 289-292, (2008); Heinsch, Faith Ann, Evaluation of remote sensing based terrestrial productivity from MODIS using regional tower eddy flux network observations, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 44, 7, pp. 1908-1923, (2006)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","26660172","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131817225"

Three issues commonly arise. First, focusing primarily on core development accessions may mean that the potential contributions of landraces or other secondary accessions may be overlooked. Second, elite cultivars may accumulate deleterious alleles away from nontarget loci due to the strong effects of artificial selection. Finally, a tendency to focus solely on SNP-based methods may cause incomplete or erroneous identification of functional variants. In practice, integration of local breeding programs with findings from global database projects may be challenging. First, local GWAS experiments may only indicate useful functional variants according to the diversity of the experimental panel, while other potentially useful loci—identifiable at a global level—may remain undiscovered. Second, large-scale experiments such as GWAS may prove prohibitively costly or logistically challenging for some agencies. Here, we present a fully automated bioinformatics pipeline (riceExplorer) that can easily integrate local breeding program sequence data with international database resources, without relying on any phenotypic experimental procedure. It identifies associated functional haplotypes that may prove more robust in determining the genotypic determinants of desirable crop phenotypes. In brief, riceExplorer evaluates a global crop database (IRRI 3000 Rice Genomes) to identify haplotypes that are associated with extreme phenotypic variation at the global level and recorded in the database. It then examines which potentially useful variants are present in the local crop panel, before distinguishing between those that are already incorporated into the elite breeding accessions and those only found among secondary varieties (e.g., landraces). Results highlight the effectiveness of our pipeline, identifying potentially useful functional haplotypes across the genome that are absent from elite cultivars and found among landraces and other secondary varieties in our breeding program. riceExplorer can automatically conduct a full genome analysis and produces annotated graphical output of chromosomal maps, potential global diversity sources, and summary tables. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioinformatics; Crop Breeding; Deleterious Variants; Elite Cultivars; Genomics; Non-focal Varieties","","","","This study was supported by grant from National Science and Technology Development Agency, Thailand (NSTDA grant number: P-18–51456).","Abbai, Ragavendran, Haplotype analysis of key genes governing grain yield and quality traits across 3K RG panel reveals scope for the development of tailor-made rice with enhanced genetic gains, Plant Biotechnology Journal, 17, 8, pp. 1612-1622, (2019); Rediscovery of Landraces as A Resource for the Future, (2018); Bardel, Claire, On the use of haplotype phylogeny to detect disease susceptibility loci, BMC Genetics, 6, (2005); Bhandari, Aditi, Selection of trait-specific markers and multi-environment models improve genomic predictive ability in rice, PLOS ONE, 14, 5, (2019); Bhat, Javaid Akhter, Features and applications of haplotypes in crop breeding, Communications Biology, 4, 1, (2021); Birchler, James A., Unraveling the genetic basis of hybrid vigor, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 103, 35, pp. 12957-12958, (2006); Blair, Matthew Wohlgemuth, Use of the advanced backcross-QTL method to transfer seed mineral accumulation nutrition traits from wild to Andean cultivated common beans, Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 125, 5, pp. 1015-1031, (2012); Bryant, David J., Inferring species trees directly from biallelic genetic markers: Bypassing gene trees in a full coalescent analysis, Molecular Biology and Evolution, 29, 8, pp. 1917-1932, (2012); Cingolani, Pablo E., A program for annotating and predicting the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms, SnpEff: SNPs in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster strain w1118; iso-2; iso-3, Fly, 6, 2, pp. 80-92, (2012); Clark, Andrew G., The role of haplotypes in candidate gene studies, Genetic Epidemiology, 27, 4, pp. 321-333, (2004)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","1664462X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130286261"

However, in most of the countries including Malaysia, soil data are available as low resolution and semi-detailed soil series maps, which hinder their applicability. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a framework to compare the conventional soil mapping with digital soil databases and to determine the accuracy of digital soil mapping. Kedah province located in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia was selected as the study area. Observed soil (Cation exchange capacity - CEC, pH, organic matter as chemical and clay, sand and silt content as physical properties) data published by the Department of Agriculture, Malaysia was compared with SoilGrid (soillgrid.org) dataset. The depths of observed data were harmonised to international standard soil depths as; 0-5, 5-15, 15-30, s30-60, 60-100, and 100-200 cm using the equal quadratic spline approach. Global data were compared with harmonised 16 selected soil series data in Malaysia. Observed soil chemical properties (CEC, pH, and organic carbon) were within the range of SoilGrids data which allows the selected chemical properties to be used where observed data are limited or not available. In contrast, most of the soil physical properties from SoilGrids were not accurate when compared with the observed data. The developed framework in this study can be used to strengthen the accuracy of the available soil data in Earth system models, particularly those that are related to organic carbon and soil structural properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conventional Soil Mapping; Soil Harmonization; Soilgrids; Spline Tools","","","","Authors acknowledge European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, grant agreement No. 774234.","Review of Existing Information on the Interrelations Between Soil and Climate Change, (2008); Input Mark Syst, (2000); Imeson, Anton Charles, Soil erosion and climate change: the transect approach and the influence of scale, Geomorphology, 23, 2-4, pp. 219-227, (1998); Dasgupta, Susmita, Climate change and soil salinity: The case of coastal Bangladesh, Ambio, 44, 8, pp. 815-826, (2015); Borrelli, Pasquale, Land use and climate change impacts on global soil erosion by water (2015-2070), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 117, 36, pp. 21994-22001, (2020); Soil Properties Physical Chemical Biological Mechanical, (2017); Wimalasiri, Eranga M., A framework for the development of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) as a crop for the future in tropical environments, Industrial Crops and Products, 172, (2021); Awang Besar, Normah, Carbon stock and sequestration potential of an agroforestry system in Sabah, Malaysia, Forests, 11, 2, (2020); Rozainah, Mohamad Zakaria, Estimation of carbon pool in soil, above and below ground vegetation at different types of mangrove forests in Peninsular Malaysia, Marine Pollution Bulletin, 137, pp. 237-245, (2018); Plos One, (2016)","","IOP Publishing Ltd","","7th International Conference on Climate Change, ICCC 2021","","Virtual, Online","178921","17551307; 17551315","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129164671"

Recent climatic shifts in this highly diverse region are not well understood due to sparse observations, and as the skill of global climate products have not been thoroughly evaluated. We examine the performance for several reanalysis and satellite-based global climate data products (CHIRPS/CHIRTS, ERA5, MERRA-2, PERSIANN-CDR) as compared to the observation-based GPCC precipitation dataset. These datasets are then used to evaluate the magnitude and spatial extent of hydroclimatic shifts and changes in aridity and drought over the last four decades. We focus on water-limited regions that are important for rain-fed agriculture and particularly vulnerable to further drying, and newly delineate those regions for Central America and Mexico by adapting prior definitions of the Central American Dry Corridor. Our results indicate that the CHIRPS dataset exhibits the greatest skill for the study area. A general warming of 0.2–0.8°C·decade−1 was found across the region, particularly for spring and winter, while widespread drying was indicated by several measures for the summer growing season. Changes in annual precipitation have been inconsistent, but show declines of 20–25% in eastern Honduras/Nicaragua and in several parts of Mexico. Some regions most vulnerable to drying have been subject to statistically significant trends towards summer drying, increases in drought and aridity driven by precipitation declines, and/or a lengthening of the winter dry season, highlighting areas where climate adaptation measures may be most urgent. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central America; Climate Change; Drought; Dry Corridor; Precipitation; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Chirp Modulation; Drought; Rain; Annual Precipitation; Climatic Shifts; Global Datasets; Rain Fed Agriculture; Seasonal Variation; Sensitive Regions; Smallholder Livelihood; Water-limited Regions; Drying; Agricultural Application; Climate Effect; Data Set; Growing Season; Hydrometeorology; Precipitation (climatology); Rainfed Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Satellite Data; Seasonal Variation; Trend Analysis; Vulnerability; Warming; Central America; Honduras; Mexico [north America]; Nicaragua","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Chirp modulation; Drought; Rain; Annual precipitation; Climatic shifts; Global datasets; Rain fed agriculture; Seasonal variation; Sensitive regions; Smallholder livelihood; Water-limited regions; Drying; agricultural application; climate effect; data set; growing season; hydrometeorology; precipitation (climatology); rainfed agriculture; remote sensing; satellite data; seasonal variation; trend analysis; vulnerability; warming; Central America; Honduras; Mexico [North America]; Nicaragua","","","Funding text 1: We gratefully acknowledge funding for this work from U.S. National Science Foundation Grant BCS\u20101539795, DFG (German Research Foundation) Grant STA 632/6\u20101, and the Freiburg Institute of Advanced Studies (FRIAS) at Freiburg University (Germany).

These debates are plagued by semantic and conceptual confusions in terms of the definitions proffered to the ‘middle ground’ between foragers and farmers, as well as in terms of how categories are applied in the past and the present. In broad terms, perspectives diverge between considering the adoption of agriculture to be an ‘all-or-nothing’ commitment or a continuum representing various types of ‘middle ground’. A careful unpacking of data from traditional societies in Murdock's Ethnographic Atlas reveals geographical structuring of the global dataset, as well as considerable differences based on local crop assemblages. In sum, agro-pastoral, cereal-based societies in Africa and Eurasia exhibit a stronger tendency with respect to subsistence dependence on farming, while societies in North America and those reliant on root crops and arboriculture in the wet tropics tend more towards a ‘middle ground’ that incorporates aspects of farming without abandoning foraging. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agro-pastoral; Arboriculture; Ethnographic Atlas; Farming; Foraging; George Murdock; Global Distributions; Horticulture; Land Use","","","","Tim Denham’s involvement in this research was funded by an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (2016-2020, FT150100420); Mark Donohue’s involvement was funded by an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (2011-2015, FT100100241).

The response of soil bacterial communities to different fertilization regimes has been studied widely, but the inconsistent results urged us to systematically study the effect of multiple environmental factors on bacterial diversity and composition under different fertilization regimes. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of a global dataset from 105 publications to explore the effect of mineral nitrogen, straw, and manure addition on soil bacterial alpha-diversity (Shannon and Chao1 indices) and community composition. Mineral nitrogen and straw addition decreased the Shannon (mineral nitrogen: –4.48%; straw: –11.83%) and Chao1 (mineral nitrogen: –0.97%; straw: –11.57%) indices, while manure addition increased the Shannon (0.53%) and Chao1 (5.64%) indices. The three types of fertilizer all favored the growth of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes and inhibited the growth of Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae. Manure addition had the greatest increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and the least decrease in abundance of Nitrospirae. Manure addition increased soil organic carbon, total soil nitrogen, and soil microbial biomass carbon more than mineral nitrogen and straw addition. Mineral nitrogen and straw addition decreased soil pH, while manure addition increased soil pH. Soil environmental and climate factors significantly drove changes in bacterial alpha-diversity and community, particularly soil pH.

Numerous experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of CA under various local conditions, and meta-analysis has become a standard approach in agricultural sector for analysing and summarizing the experimental data. Meta-analysis provides valuable synthetic information based on mean effect size estimation. However, summarizing large amounts of information by way of a single mean effect value is not always satisfactory, especially when considering agricultural practices. Indeed, their impacts on crop yields are often non-linear, and vary widely depending on a number of factors, including soil properties and local climate conditions. To address this issue, here we present a machine learning approach to produce data-driven global maps describing the spatial distribution of the productivity of CA versus conventional tillage (CT). Our objective is to evaluate and compare several machine-learning models for their ability in estimating the productivity of CA systems, and to analyse uncertainty in the model outputs. We consider different usages, including classification, point regression and quantile regression. Our approach covers the comparison of 12 different machine learning algorithms, model training, tuning with cross-validation, testing, and global projection of results. The performances of these algorithms are compared based on a recent global dataset including more than 4,000 pairs of crop yield data for CA vs. CT. We show that random forest has the best performance in classification and regression, while quantile regression forest performs better than quantile neural networks in quantile regression. The best algorithms are used to map crop productivity of CA vs. CT at the global scale, and results reveal that the performance of CA vs. CT is characterized by a strong spatial variability, and that the probability of yield gain with CA is highly dependent on geographical locations. This result demonstrates that our approach is much more informative than simply presenting average effect sizes produced by standard meta-analyses, and paves the way for such probabilistic, spatially-explicit approaches in many other fields of research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithm Comparison; Conservation Agriculture; Crop Yield; Machine Learning; Model Performance","","","","This work was supported by the ANR under the ?Investissements d?avenir? program with the reference ANR-16-CONV-0003 (CLAND) and by the INRAE CIRAD meta-program ?GloFoods?.","Aho, Ken A., Model selection for ecologists: The worldviews of AIC and BIC, Ecology, 95, 3, pp. 631-636, (2014); Ali, Najat, Classification of heterogeneous data based on data type impact on similarity, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 840, pp. 252-263, (2019); Bergmeir, Christoph, Neural networks in R using the Stuttgart neural network simulator: RSNNS, Journal of Statistical Software, 46, 7, (2012); Bozdag, Aslı, Spatial prediction of PM10 concentration using machine learning algorithms in Ankara, Turkey, Environmental Pollution, 263, (2020); Cannon, Alex J., Non-crossing nonlinear regression quantiles by monotone composite quantile regression neural network, with application to rainfall extremes, Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 32, 11, pp. 3207-3225, (2018); Cannon, Alex J., Quantile regression neural networks: Implementation in R and application to precipitation downscaling, Computers and Geosciences, 37, 9, pp. 1277-1284, (2011); Cao, Juan, Wheat yield predictions at a county and field scale with deep learning, machine learning, and google earth engine, European Journal of Agronomy, 123, (2021); Eugenics Review, (1960); Chan, Simon, Continuous Model Selection for Large-Scale Recommender Systems, Handbook of Statistics, 33, pp. 107-124, (2015); Corbeels, Marc, Limits of conservation agriculture to overcome low crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa, Nature Food, 1, 7, pp. 447-454, (2020)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","2296665X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125059800"

Evaluating the potential socio-economic impact of GLOFs is essential for risk mitigation and enhancing community resilience. Yet in most of the cases, this is confronted with the challenges of limited availability of data and inaccessibility to most of the glacial lakes in the high-altitude areas. This study aims to exploit open data from different sources and high-performance hydrodynamic modelling to develop a new framework for GLOF exposure and impact assessment. In the new framework, different GLOF scenarios are created using a simple dam breach model. A high-performance hydrodynamic model is then adopted to simulate the resulting flood hydrodynamics. Necessary socio-economic information is collected and processed from multiple sources including OpenStreetMap, Google Earth, and global data products to support exposure analysis. Established depth-damage curves are used to assess the GLOF damage extents to different exposed objects and an existing fatality estimating procedure is adopted to assess the potential loss of lives. The evaluation framework is applied to the Tsho Rolpa glacial lake in Nepal. From the results, the worst GLOF scenario as considered can potentially inundate 1647 buildings, impact 5038 people and hit 123 key facilities including schools, hospitals, airports, hydropower plants, etc. It may substantially damage 900 buildings, 10.63 km2 of agricultural land and 50.9 km roads and may potentially lead to 45 deaths even if warning is available. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Glacial Lake Outburst Floods; Hazard Exposure; Hydrodynamic Flood Modelling; Impact Assessment; Object-based Assessment; Open-source Data; Floods; Glacial Geology; Hydrodynamics; Lakes; Open Data; Flood Modeling; Glacial Lake Outburst Flood; Hazard Exposure; Hydrodynamic Flood Modeling; Impact Assessments; Object Based; Object-based Assessment; Objects-based; Open Source Datum; Performance; Hazards; Data; Flood; Glacial Lake; Hazard Assessment; Hydrodynamics; Hydrological Modeling; Outburst; Agricultural Land; Airport; Article; Clinical Article; Fatality; Flooding; Human; Hydropower; Nepal; Ice Cover; Lake; Janakpur; Tsho Rolpa; Humans; Ice Cover","Floods; Glacial geology; Hydrodynamics; Lakes; Open Data; Flood modeling; Glacial lake outburst flood; Hazard exposure; Hydrodynamic flood modeling; Impact assessments; Object based; Object-based assessment; Objects-based; Open source datum; Performance; Hazards; data; flood; glacial lake; hazard assessment; hydrodynamics; hydrological modeling; outburst; agricultural land; airport; article; clinical article; fatality; flooding; human; hydropower; Nepal; ice cover; lake; Janakpur; Tsho Rolpa; Humans; Ice Cover","","","This work is supported by the WeACT project (NE/S005919/1) funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through the SHEAR programme.

Yet, the water balance of cultivated areas is strongly influenced by applied management practices (e.g. planting, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting). The SWAT+ (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model represents agricultural land by default in a generic way, where the start of the cropping season is driven by accumulated heat units. However, this approach does not work for tropical and subtropical regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where crop growth dynamics are mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature. In this study, we present an approach on how to incorporate crop phenology using decision tables and global datasets of rainfed and irrigated croplands with the associated cropping calendar and fertilizer applications in a regional SWAT+ model for northeastern Africa. We evaluate the influence of the crop phenology representation on simulations of leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ET) using LAI remote sensing data from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and WaPOR (Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data) ET data, respectively. Results show that a representation of crop phenology using global datasets leads to improved temporal patterns of LAI and ET simulations, especially for regions with a single cropping cycle. However, for regions with multiple cropping seasons, global phenology datasets need to be complemented with local data or remote sensing data to capture additional cropping seasons. In addition, the improvement of the cropping season also helps to improve soil erosion estimates, as the timing of crop cover controls erosion rates in the model. With more realistic growing seasons, soil erosion is largely reduced for most agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs), which can be considered as a move towards substantial improvements over previous estimates. We conclude that regional and global hydrological models can benefit from improved representations of crop phenology and the associated management practices. Future work regarding the incorporation of multiple cropping seasons in global phenology data is needed to better represent cropping cycles in areas where they occur using regional to global hydrological models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biology; Cultivation; Decision Tables; Erosion; Hydrology; Land Use; Remote Sensing; Soils; Tropics; Agricultural Land Use; Crop Phenology; Cropping Seasons; Global Datasets; Leaf Area Index; Management Practises; Remote Sensing Data; Soil And Water Assessment Tools; Soil Erosion; Tool Models; Crops; Agricultural Land; Agricultural Management; Hydrological Change; Land Use; Soil And Water Assessment Tool","Biology; Cultivation; Decision tables; Erosion; Hydrology; Land use; Remote sensing; Soils; Tropics; Agricultural land use; Crop phenology; Cropping seasons; Global datasets; Leaf Area Index; Management practises; Remote sensing data; Soil and Water assessment tools; Soil erosion; Tool models; Crops; agricultural land; agricultural management; hydrological change; land use; soil and water assessment tool","","","Acknowledgements.

Improper dumping of plastic litter can cause environmental degradation. In particular, the disposal of local plastic litter, sewage sludge landfills and plastic mulch from agricultural activities is a serious problem and a major concern for soil litter. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network-based model called GENII to predict the spatial distribution and quantity of local plastic litter leveraging crowdsensing data. Specifically, we leverage meteorological data to embed the temporal dependency. To represent the spatial dependency, we first use K-means method to cluster the spatial distribution of litter. Based on each cluster, we build multiple graphs leveraging the in-cluster POI and litter distribution, and then apply graph convolutional neural networks and heterogeneous graph attention networks to aggregate neighboring information of these graphs, respectively. Fully connected layers are used for the final litter prediction. Experiments on real-world data verify that our model is effective for the citywide litter prediction, while outperforming multiple prediction models. We expect that the proposed model can be used to improve the city's litter management system and serve as a better guidance for the city's plastic litter control.

The classification performance appears inadequate when every original HSI band is in use. In order to improve performance of classification, band (dimensionality) reduction approaches using feature extraction as well as feature selection techniques are widely utilized to mitigate this. Despite the widespread usage of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in HSI feature reduction, it frequently struggles to assess the local beneficial properties of the HSI as it analyzes solely the HSI's global data. Segmented-PCA (SPCA) and Sparse-PCA are initiatives to replace the PCA. In this paper, we propose the Segmented-Sparse-PCA (SSPCA) feature extraction approach nto exploit the amenities of both SPCA and Sparse- PCA. In particular, we first segment the entire dataset into a number of strongly correlated spectral band sub-groups and then apply Sparse-PCA to each subgroup separately. Afterward, the results are analyzed through experimenting over the mixed agricultural Indian Pines HSI dataset using a per-pixel Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experimental results exhibit that the overall classification performance of the proposed SSPCA (91.024%) performs better compared to every other investigated approaches: PCA (83.554%), SPCA (86.774%), Sparse-PCA (88.39%) and the entire original bands of HSI (82.997%). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feature Ex-traction; Hyperspectral Image Classification; Pca; Remote Sensing; Segmented Pca; Segmented Sparse-pca; Sparse Pca; Classification (of Information); Extraction; Feature Selection; Image Classification; Remote Sensing; Support Vector Machines; Feature Ex-traction; Hyperspectral; Hyperspectral Image Classification; Principal-component Analysis; Remote-sensing; Segmented Principal Component Analyse; Segmented Sparse-principal Component Analyse; Sparse Principal Component Analysis; Principal Component Analysis","Classification (of information); Extraction; Feature Selection; Image classification; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Feature ex-traction; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral image classification; Principal-component analysis; Remote-sensing; Segmented principal component analyse; Segmented sparse-principal component analyse; Sparse principal component analysis; Principal component analysis","","","","Remote Sensing Digital Image Analysis an Introduction, (2006); Hossain, Md Ali, Subspace detection using a mutual information measure for hyperspectral image classification, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 11, 2, pp. 424-428, (2014); Uddin, Md Palash, Information-theoretic feature selection with segmentation-based folded principal component analysis (PCA) for hyperspectral image classification, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 42, 1, pp. 286-321, (2021); Jia, Xiuping, Feature mining for hyperspectral image classification, Proceedings of the IEEE, 101, 3, pp. 676-697, (2013); Melgani, Farid, Classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images with support vector machines, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 42, 8, pp. 1778-1790, (2004); Tsai, Fuan, Spectrally segmented principal component analysis of hyperspectral imagery for mapping invasive plant species, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 28, 5, pp. 1023-1039, (2007); Fauvel, Mathieu, Kernel principal component analysis for feature reduction in hyperspectrale images analysis, pp. 238-241, (2006); Liu, Bing, Supervised deep feature extraction for hyperspectral image classification, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 56, 4, pp. 1909-1921, (2018); Shao, Yuanjie, Spatial and class structure regularized sparse representation graph for semi-supervised hyperspectral image classification, Pattern Recognition, 81, pp. 81-94, (2018); Jia, Xiuping, Segmented principal components transformation for efficient hyperspectral remote-sensing image display and classification, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 37, 1 II, pp. 538-542, (1999)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority; Gazi Communications; ICT Division; Nesco; SincoS; Supersign Cable","4th International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, ICECTE 2022","","Rajshahi; Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology","188470","","9798350320541","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160205788"

Machine learning (ML) models using these spectra can be calibrated, adding only samples from one field or gathering different areas to augment the data inserted and enhance the models’ accuracy. Robustness assessment of prediction models usually rely on statistical metrics. However, how the spatial distribution of predicted soil attributes can be affected is still little explored, despite the fact that agriculture productive decisions depend on the spatial variability of these attributes. The objective of this study was to use online NIR spectra to predict soil attributes at field level, evaluating the statistical metrics and also the spatial distribution observed in prediction to compare a local prediction model with models that gathered samples from other areas. A total of 383 online NIR spectra were acquired in an experimental field to predict clay, sand, organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). To build ML calibrations, 72 soil spectra from the experimental field (local dataset) were gathered, with 59 samples from another area nearby, in the same geological region (geological dataset) and with this area nearby and more 60 samples from another area in a different region (global dataset). Principal components regression was performed using k-fold (k=10) cross-validation. Clay models reported similar errors of prediction, and although the local model presented a lower R2 (0.17), the spatial distribution of prediction proved that the models had similar performance. Although OM patterns were comparable between the three datasets, local prediction, with the lower R2 (0.75), was the best fitted. However, for secondary NIR response attributes, only CEC could be successfully predicted and only using local dataset, since the statistical metrics were compatible, but the geological and global models misrepresented the spatial patterns in the field. Agronomic plausibility of spatial distribution proved to be a key factor for the evaluation of soil attributes prediction at field level. Results suggest that local calibrations are the best recommendation for diffuse reflectance spectroscopy NIR prediction of soil attributes and that statistical metrics alone can mispresent the accuracy of prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture Management; Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy; Geostatistics; Machine Learning; Soil Variability","","","","Soil sample analyses were funded by the Brazilian Institute of Analysis (IBRA).

This restricts the researchers from developing deep learning based models for precision agricultural tasks involving crop row detection. We suggest the utilization of small real-world datasets along with additional data generated by simulations to yield similar crop row detection performance as that of a model trained with a large real world dataset. Our method could reach the performance of a deep learning based crop row detection model trained with real-world data by using 60% less labelled real-world data. Our model performed well against field variations such as shadows, sunlight and growth stages.

Plant diseases not only reduce the agricultural yield but also reduce the quality of the produce. Thus, tackling plant diseases at an early stage becomes crucial. This becomes a difficult task if done manually as tracking large farmlands is not easy. In this paper, we present an approach for detecting plant diseases. One of the datasets used in this work is the most popularly available dataset, Plant Village. Since the dataset is imbalanced, generative adversarial network (GAN) has been used to generate synthetic minority class images for balancing the dataset. Most of the existing works have only used the Plant Village dataset for training and testing, which makes these trained models unfit for plant images in uncontrolled conditions. Thus, Plant Doc, a real-world dataset, has also been used. Transfer learning has been used in our proposed system for training the CNN models to detect diseases. Segmentation and object detection methods have been employed to identify individual plant leaves from images containing multiple leaves and complex backgrounds, thus facilitating the model to work on real-world images. Each prominently visible leaf was segmented and the disease and severity predictions have been made on the masked image.

The Internet of Things (IoT) and also Analytics techniques are useful tools for the actualization of smart farms as they allow for information dissemination to rural farmers and also serve as a platform for monitoring farm activities. When farm activities are properly monitored, food production is optimized. As the world’s population grows, there is a greater challenge of the availability of food. The combination of IoT and data analytics has not been fully explored for Smart farming especially in developing economies. This paper proposes a FarmSmart Application using an IoT-based mobile monitoring system that combines sensors, and data analytics to manage irrigation processes and broadcast Agricultural information to farmers. The FarmSmartApp was implemented on the IntelliJ IDE using C++ and MongoDB.Python and Excel were used for the data analytics. The effectiveness of the proposed system is examined on a real-world dataset harvested from the mounted sensors. Also an initial evaluation of the system is done by stakeholders. Simple Analysis of Variance of light, moisture and temperature led to the rejection of the null hypothesis of no significance difference in mean effect among the variables since fcalc is greater than fcrit justified by p value less than 0.05.

In large-scale experiments, however, UAV images suffer from containing a multitudinous amount of crops in a complex canopy architecture. Especially for the observation of temporal effects, this complicates the recognition of individual plants over several images and the extraction of relevant information tremendously. Results: In this work, we present a hands-on workflow for the automatized temporal and spatial identification and individualization of crop images from UAVs abbreviated as ""cataloging""based on comprehensible computer vision methods. We evaluate the workflow on 2 real-world datasets. One dataset is recorded for observation of Cercospora leaf spot - a fungal disease - in sugar beet over an entire growing cycle. The other one deals with harvest prediction of cauliflower plants. The plant catalog is utilized for the extraction of single plant images seen over multiple time points. This gathers a large-scale spatiotemporal image dataset that in turn can be applied to train further machine learning models including various data layers. Conclusion: The presented approach improves analysis and interpretation of UAV data in agriculture significantly. By validation with some reference data, our method shows an accuracy that is similar to more complex deep learning-based recognition techniques. Our workflow is able to automatize plant cataloging and training image extraction, especially for large datasets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Plant Identification; Plant Individualization; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Uav Imaging; Article; Cercospora; Computer Vision; Controlled Study; Deep Learning; Image Processing; Information Processing; Leaf Spot; Machine Learning; Mycosis; Nonhuman; Plant Identification; Precision Agriculture; Remote Sensing; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Workflow; Agriculture; Computer; Crop; Procedures; Agriculture; Computers; Crops, Agricultural; Remote Sensing Technology","Article; Cercospora; computer vision; controlled study; deep learning; image processing; information processing; leaf spot; machine learning; mycosis; nonhuman; plant identification; precision agriculture; remote sensing; unmanned aerial vehicle; workflow; agriculture; computer; crop; procedures; Agriculture; Computers; Crops, Agricultural; Remote Sensing Technology","","","This work has been funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemein-schaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy–EXC 2070–390732324 and partially by the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development with contribution from North-Rhine Westphalia (17-02.12.01-10/16–EP-0004617925-19-001).

To investigate this question this paper uses a standard Input-Output modeling framework and data from 141 countries and regions to construct a new global dataset of employment, value-added, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (disaggregated into CO2 and Non-CO2 elements), and air pollution (including nine categories of air pollutants such as PM2.5) multipliers from supply side investments. We find that many of the traditional sectors in agriculture and industry have large employment multipliers, but also generate male dominant, lower skill employment, and tend to have higher emission multipliers. It is in economies dominated by these sectors that trade-offs to a 'greener' transition will emerge most sharply. However, we find a substantial heterogeneity in outcomes, so even in these economies, there exist other sectors with high employment multipliers and low emissions, including sectors that are more conducive to female employment. In addition, we find a high correlation between industries that generate GHG emissions, which cause long term climate impacts, and those that generate air pollution, which have immediate harmful impacts on human health, suggesting that policies could be designed to simultaneously confer longer climate benefits with immediate health improvements. Our results confirm some of the findings from recent research and shed new light on opportunities for greening economies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Green Growth; Green Jobs; Input-output Analysis; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Economic And Social Effects; Employment; Gas Emissions; Greenhouse Gases; Industrial Emissions; Green Growths; Green Jobs; Green Stimuli; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Input-output Modeling; Input/output Analysis; Modeling Data; Modelling Framework; Productive Capacity; Standard Input; Climate Change; Atmospheric Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Data Set; Employment; Environmental Economics; Greenhouse Gas; Heterogeneity; Input-output Analysis; Investment","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Employment; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Green growths; Green jobs; Green stimuli; Greenhouse gas emissions; Input-output modeling; Input/Output analysis; Modeling data; Modelling framework; Productive capacity; Standard input; Climate change; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; data set; employment; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; heterogeneity; input-output analysis; investment","","","The authors would like to thank Freddie Taylor, Associate Editor of the journal, and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and constructive suggestions.

If a timely and correct diagnosis is not done, it may lead to adverse e_ects on agricultural productivity and crop yield. The first sign of disease appears on the leaves. Diseases can be detected from the symptoms appearing on leaves. Aiming at tomato, this paper presents a novel disease recognition convolution neural network architecture based on Self-excitation network and ResNet architecture. The main research gap identified was the use of lab controlled standard images, consideration of only biotic disorders and low accuracy on unseen test dataset. The main contribution of this work is to increase generalization. Therefore, to reduce generalization error, augmentation is applied and images are captured in a manner where leaf is surrounded by occlusion areas. To capture minute lesion and spot details, multiscale feature extraction with dilated kernel is applied. Our collected real-world dataset consists of 11 types of biotic and abiotic disorders. Various experiments are carried out to verify proposed method's e_ectiveness. The proposed method has a recognition accuracy of 81.19% on a real-world validation dataset using 75-10-15(train-validation-test) division ratio on augmented data and average recognition accuracy of 91.76% for the 10-fold cross-validation technique. The comparative analysis with all state-of-the-art techniques exhibited amelioration in the computation time and classification accuracy. The results are used to classify tomato biotic and abiotic diseases in the real-world complex environment and novelty lies in the fact that both biotic and abiotic elements are taken into account. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Image Enhancement; Multiscale Feature Extraction; Residual Block; Tomato Leaf Disease Recognition","","","","","Barbedo, Jayme G.A., Plant disease identification from individual lesions and spots using deep learning, Biosystems Engineering, 180, pp. 96-107, (2019); Basavaiah, Jagadeesh, Tomato Leaf Disease Classification using Multiple Feature Extraction Techniques, Wireless Personal Communications, 115, 1, pp. 633-651, (2020); Pantazi, Xanthoula Eirini, Automated leaf disease detection in different crop species through image features analysis and One Class Classifiers, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 156, pp. 96-104, (2019); Chouhan, Siddharth Singh, Leaf disease segmentation and classification of Jatropha Curcas L. and Pongamia Pinnata L. biofuel plants using computer vision based approaches, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 171, (2021); Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition, (2014); Krizhevsky, Alex, ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2, pp. 1097-1105, (2012); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016); Szegedy, Christian, Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 2818-2826, (2016); Densely Connected Convolutional Networks, (2016); Lee, Sue Han, New perspectives on plant disease characterization based on deep learning, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 170, (2020)","","University of Bahrain","","","","","","2210142X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128605006"

Previous studies assessed the drought impact using a drought index based on a single input data set, while the variability of the drought index to the input data choice is notable. In this study, a drought index based on the standardized precipitation index with multiple timescales using several global precipitation datasets was compared with the detrended anomaly based on the global dataset of historical yield for major crops over 1981-2016. Results show that the drought index based on the ensemble precipitation dataset correlates better with the crop yield anomaly than a single dataset. Based on the drought index using ensemble datasets, global crop areas significantly affected by drought during the study period were around 23%, 8%, 30%, and 29% for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat, respectively, induced mainly by medium to longer drought timescale (5-12 months). This study indicates that most crops cultivated in dry regions were affected by droughts worldwide, while rice shows less correlation to drought as it is generally irrigated and cultivated in humid regions with less drought exposure. This study provides a valuable framework for data choices in drought index development and a better knowledge of the drought impact on agriculture using different timescales on a global scale towards understanding crop vulnerability to climate disruptions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crop; Drought; Multisource; Standardized Precipitation Index; Yield Loss; Crops; Cultivation; Input Output Programs; Stream Flow; Crop Yield; Global Scale; Input Datas; Multi Scalars; Multi-sources; Precipitation Data; Scale Relationship; Standardized Precipitation Index; Time-scales; Yield Loss; Drought; Climate Change; Crop Plant; Crop Production; Crop Yield; Data Set; Index Method; Spatiotemporal Analysis","Crops; Cultivation; Input output programs; Stream flow; Crop yield; Global scale; Input datas; Multi scalars; Multi-Sources; Precipitation data; Scale relationship; Standardized precipitation index; Time-scales; Yield loss; Drought; climate change; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; data set; index method; spatiotemporal analysis","","","","Aghakouchak, Amir, Remote sensing of drought: Progress, challenges and opportunities, Reviews of Geophysics, 53, 2, pp. 452-480, (2015); Aitsi-Selmi, Amina A., The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction: Renewing the Global Commitment to People’s Resilience, Health, and Well-being, International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, 6, 2, pp. 164-176, (2015); Antwi-Agyei, Philip, Mapping the vulnerability of crop production to drought in Ghana using rainfall, yield and socioeconomic data, Applied Geography, 32, 2, pp. 324-334, (2012); Bachmair, Sophie, How well do meteorological indicators represent agricultural and forest drought across Europe?, Environmental Research Letters, 13, 3, (2018); Beck, Hylke E., MSWEP: 3-hourly 0.25° global gridded precipitation (1979-2015) by merging gauge, satellite, and reanalysis data, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 21, 1, pp. 589-615, (2017); Becker, Andreas, A description of the global land-surface precipitation data products of the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre with sample applications including centennial (trend) analysis from 1901-present, Earth System Science Data, 5, 1, pp. 71-99, (2013); CarrÃ£o, Hugo, Mapping global patterns of drought risk: An empirical framework based on sub-national estimates of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, Global Environmental Change, 39, pp. 108-124, (2016); Chau, Vu Ngoc, Economic impact upon agricultural production from extreme flood events in Quang Nam, central Vietnam, Natural Hazards, 75, 2, pp. 1747-1765, (2015); Chen, Huili, Effects of drought and flood on crop production in China across 1949–2015: spatial heterogeneity analysis with Bayesian hierarchical modeling, Natural Hazards, 92, 1, pp. 525-541, (2018); Chen, Mingyue, Global land precipitation: A 50-yr monthly analysis based on gauge observations, Journal of Hydrometeorology, 3, 3, pp. 249-266, (2002)","","IOP Publishing Ltd","","","","","","17489326","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123785542"

However, comprehensive studies addressing the whole-genomic features of colistin-resistant bacteria in aquatic bird farms are scarce. Over a 2-year period, we conducted surveillance to determine the whole-genome epidemiology and characterisation of mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli in aquatic bird farms in southeastern coastal China. A total of 100 mcr-1-producing isolates among 654 E. coli strains were recovered from 781 samples collected in 11 aquatic bird farms and 1 veterinary clinic in the Pearl River Delta area. Higher resistance phenotypes to 17 antibiotics were found in mcr-1-positive isolates compared with other isolates. Subsequently, 20 mcr-1-carrying isolates were sequenced to analyse the whole-genomic features. Molecular typing as well as antimicrobial resistance gene and virulence factor profiles of the isolates showed considerable diversity. Three types of genetic backbones of mcr-1 in the isolates were assembled and were identified in diverse broad-host-range plasmids and bacterial species. Pangenome analyses revealed a large genetic pool composed of the isolates. Furthermore, phylogenetic trees both of the isolates in this study and a global data set were built, indicating the spread of the three mcr-1 backbones and the mcr-1-positive isolates among different habitats, farms and even countries. This study highlights that aquatic bird farms may act as an important reservoir for mcr-1-producing E. coli, from which colistin resistance may be spread to diverse habitats, different geographical locations and even across bacterial species. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antimicrobial Resistance;

The global epidemic enforces consumers to be warned of the originality of food supply. Various technology unification is included to address this problem. Heterogeneous IoT sensors for sensing agricultural or plantation land provide system automation and monitoring for certain commodities. Sensor data and captured images of surveillance cameras are the results of IoT devices sensing capability. However, the originality of the data being stored is questioned; even worse, the data records are deleted. Such as problems occur due to several things: network congestion, device reliability, storage media, and operator. One of the findings proposed in this research is storing sensing results from each sensor and camera surveillance to a global database that is decentralized, immutable, and synchronized, known as the blockchain. All the parties involved in the smart farming system, such as farmers, food suppliers, and customers, are connected to a global blockchain network. Multi-Image Encryption (MIE) yields to secure the authenticity of captured images from multiple cameras. A specific MIE algorithm will compile and randomized the captured image from cameras to produce an encrypted image stored in the blockchain database with a unique identifier. This study provides a simulated model of blockchain technology that can be implemented in a smart farming environment using Ganache as the test net. In the smart contract, every entity connected to the blockchain network appears as a node account that is digitally assigned based on each role. Therefore, the transaction was successfully done from one node to the others. This research is the initial stages of implementing a smart farming system into the unification of various technology in the development of sustainable agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support by the Kyushu Institute of Technology.","Demestichas, Konstantinos P., Blockchain in agriculture traceability systems: A review, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 10, 12, pp. 1-22, (2020); Walter, Achim, Smart farming is key to developing sustainable agriculture, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 114, 24, pp. 6148-6150, (2017); Klerkx, Laurens W.A., A review of social science on digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0: New contributions and a future research agenda, NJAS - Wageningen Journal of Life Sciences, 90-91, (2019); Wolfert, Sjaak, Big Data in Smart Farming – A review, Agricultural Systems, 153, pp. 69-80, (2017); Dannen, Chris, Introducing ethereum and solidity: Foundations of cryptocurrency and blockchain programming for beginners, pp. 1-185, (2017); undefined; Mohanty, Sachi Nandan, An efficient Lightweight integrated Blockchain (ELIB) model for IoT security and privacy, Future Generation Computer Systems, 102, pp. 1027-1037, (2020); Zhang, Xiaoqiang, Multiple-image encryption algorithm based on mixed image element and chaos, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 62, pp. 401-413, (2017); Chen, Jian, Design of personnel big data management system based on blockchain, Future Generation Computer Systems, 101, pp. 1122-1129, (2019); Xiong, Hang, Blockchain Technology for Agriculture: Applications and Rationale, Frontiers in Blockchain, 3, (2020)","Barolli, L.; Chen, H.; Enokido, T.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","13th International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems, INCoS 2021","","Taichung","263569","23673389; 23673370","9789819652372; 9783031931055; 9789819662968; 9783031999963; 9783031950162; 9783031947698; 9783032004406; 9783031910074; 9783031926105; 9789819639410","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113773615"

The common understanding is that increased on-farm IE leads to an increase in water availability at the basin. However, in the recent past, many instances have been reported where increasing on-farm IE failed to increase water availability at the basin scale. This phenomenon is commonly known as the ‘Irrigation Efficiency Paradox (IEP)’. In this paper, we present a dynamic systems model of the IEP. Our model combines a simple mass-balance description of the water flows with the rent-seeking behavior of consumers. Through the socio-hydrological model, we arrive at a parametric characterization of the IEP, which is given by three attributes: the maximum short-term benefit enjoyed after improvement in IE, the time duration after which the paradox occurs, and the escalation of the paradox once it occurs. We find that the paradox in basins with lower evaporation and higher recharge is more pronounced, the policy implications of which are in contrast to the common narrative that seeks to reduce evaporation and increase recharge. We also use our findings along with global data sets to identify regions that are most susceptible to the IEP. We argue that much caution must be practiced while introducing efficient irrigation technologies in the identified regions so as to avoid paradoxical effects to as much extent as possible. We also discuss the seemingly counter-intuitive role of evaporation and recharge properties of the basin and how it ties in with contemporary policy narratives. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer Behavior; Irrigation Efficiency Paradox; Jevon's Paradox; Rebound Effect; Socio-hydrology; System Dynamics Modeling; Climate Models; Consumer Behavior; Efficiency; Hydrology; Irrigation; Public Policy; Water Management; Agriculture Sectors; Hydrological Models; Irrigation Efficiency; Irrigation Efficiency Paradox; Jevon Paradox; On-farm Irrigation Efficiency; Rebound-effect; Socio-hydrology; System Dynamics Modelling; Water Availability; Evaporation; Agroindustry; Hydrological Modeling; Irrigation System; Recharge; Water Availability","Climate models; Consumer behavior; Efficiency; Hydrology; Irrigation; Public policy; Water management; Agriculture sectors; Hydrological models; Irrigation efficiency; Irrigation efficiency paradox; Jevon paradox; On-farm irrigation efficiency; Rebound-effect; Socio-hydrology; System dynamics modelling; Water availability; Evaporation; agroindustry; hydrological modeling; irrigation system; recharge; water availability","","","Funding text 1: A.

While a lot of work focused on structured environments, this article focuses on navigation in off-road environments. In the off-road environment, due to the lack of salient features, scan matching algorithms tend to degenerate. Therefore, the first contribution of this paper is to propose a reliable degeneracy indicator which can evaluate the scan matching performance. The evaluated degeneracy indicator is then integrated into the factor graph optimization framework which is used in both the offline mapping system and the online localization system. Moreover, a complete navigation system that can handle the incomplete and partly outdated LiDAR maps is developed. Extensive tests on real-world data sets show that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, especially in degenerate scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Vehicle; Off-road Environment; Robust Localization; Scan Matching; Agricultural Robots; Navigation Systems; Off Road Vehicles; Optical Radar; Roads And Streets; Autonomous Land Vehicles; Mapping Systems; On-line Localization; Road Environment; Salient Features; Scan Matching; State-of-the-art Approach; Structured Environment; Autonomous Vehicles","Agricultural robots; Navigation systems; Off road vehicles; Optical radar; Roads and streets; Autonomous land vehicles; Mapping systems; On-line localization; Road environment; Salient features; Scan matching; State-of-the-art approach; Structured environment; Autonomous vehicles","","","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under No. 61790565 and the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province of China under Grant 2019JJ50738.","undefined, (2019); Almalioglu, Yasin, Milli-RIO: Ego-Motion Estimation with Low-Cost Millimetre-Wave Radar, IEEE Sensors Journal, 21, 3, pp. 3314-3323, (2021); undefined, (2001); Besl, Paul J., A Method for Registration of 3-D Shapes, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 14, 2, pp. 239-256, (1992); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2007); undefined, (2013); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2017); undefined, (2018)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","15564967; 15564959","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118524189"

However, predicting where these changes occur and how they will influence current pest control efforts is a challenge. Using experimentally parameterised and field-tested models, we show that climate change over the past 50 years increased the overwintering range of a global agricultural insect pest, the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), by ~2.4 million km2 worldwide. Our analysis of global data sets revealed that pesticide resistance levels are linked to the species’ overwintering range: mean pesticide resistance was 158 times higher in overwintering sites compared to sites with only seasonal occurrence. By facilitating local persistence all year round, climate change can promote and expand pesticide resistance of this destructive species globally.

Past studies developed several LULC change models to identify the factors behind the changes and to simulate future LULC scenarios. However, the accuracy of these models remained contentious and a matter of ongoing debate and research. Most of these studies used a training dataset to train the model and a validation dataset to validate the prediction accuracy, both of which are a part of the original training dataset. However, to evaluate the model's actual predictive capability in terms of spatial data modeling, it is necessary to test the model's performance on the real-world dataset. In this study, we presented an XGBoost model aiming at improving the prediction accuracy while used a separate test dataset to test the model's actual predictive capacity. We applied the method to predict the land cover change of the Khulna City Corporation (KCC) area in Bangladesh. The study reveals that the KCC area experienced rapid urban development during the 2002–2018 period while the agricultural and vacant land declined at a similar rate. The major factors contributing to this substantial change of the city's land covers are-proximity to existing built-up areas and proximity to major roads. Our study indicates that agricultural areas and wetlands closer to the major roads and existing urban areas have a greater probability of converting into built-up areas. Our experiment demonstrates that the XGBoost model can predict the city's land cover change with greater accuracy and outperforms the benchmark models such as the LR-CA and ANN-CA. The finding assures the reliability of the XGBoost model while predicting future land-cover scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Land Cover Modeling; Land-use Land Cover Change Modeling; Logistic Regression; Machine Learning; Xgboost","","","","","Ackermann, F., Airborne laser scanning - Present status and future expectations, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 54, 2-3, pp. 64-67, (1999); Planning Forum, (2021); Bharath, Aithal H., Agent based modelling urban dynamics of Bhopal, India, Journal of Settlements and Spatial Planning, 7, 1, pp. 1-14, (2016); Chen, Tianqi, XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, 13-17-August-2016, pp. 785-794, (2016); Chen, Guangzhao, Global projections of future urban land expansion under shared socioeconomic pathways, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020); Modelling Spatial and Temporal Urban Growth, (2003); Dewan, Ashraf Mahmmood, Land use and land cover change in Greater Dhaka, Bangladesh: Using remote sensing to promote sustainable urbanization, Applied Geography, 29, 3, pp. 390-401, (2009); Dewan, Ashraf Mahmmood, Dynamics of land use/cover changes and the analysis of landscape fragmentation in Dhaka Metropolitan, Bangladesh, GeoJournal, 77, 3, pp. 315-330, (2012); Dewan, Ashraf Mahmmood, Urbanisation and environmental degradation in Dhaka metropolitan area of Bangladesh, International Journal of Environment and Sustainable Development, 11, 2, pp. 118-147, (2012); Land Cover Classification System Lccs Classification Concepts and User Manual, (2000)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","23529385","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117166001"

Climate is often the primary component of the abiotic (fundamental) niche, especially among terrestrial plants. In invasion biology, there is an ongoing debate on the prevalence of niche shifts, which may be linked to divergent traits in a species’ native and invaded ranges, as well as dispersal limitations and invasion lag phases. Using a global dataset, we tested whether shifts occurred in the invader Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), which has undergone intercontinental spread as well as habitat-switching within its invaded range in North America. Climate space ordination showed that North America is, on average, colder than Afro-Eurasia, and North American Johnsongrass occupies wetter environments than in its native range. Within North America, both agricultural and non-agricultural ecotypes shifted slightly toward colder climates. Notably, while non-agricultural populations far outnumber agricultural ones, the former occupy a narrower niche (D<inf>M</inf> = 42.7 ± 0.8) than the latter (D<inf>M</inf> = 59.3 ± 1.1), implying agriculture's role in providing suitable environments in otherwise suboptimal climates. Maximum entropy models of agricultural and non-agricultural North American populations showed limited ecotypic differences in current suitability and range expansion under climate change through the rest of this century. We also predicted climatic suitability for Johnsongrass to increase most in the Upper Midwest and Great Plains by 2100. Our results help contextualize the empirical evidence for ecotypic differentiation in Johnsongrass, as well predict future range expansion and damage niches. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Ecotypes; Invasive Species; Niche Shift; Species Distributions","","","","This work was partially supported by the Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture Global Food Security CAP [ 2015-68004-493 23492 to JNB].","Abdelkrim, Jawad, Island colonization and founder effects: The invasion of the Guadeloupe islands by ship rats (Rattus rattus), Molecular Ecology, 14, 10, pp. 2923-2931, (2005); Adhikari, Pradeep, Potential impact of climate change on plant invasion in the Republic of Korea, Journal of Ecology and Environment, 43, 1, (2019); Allouche, Omri, Assessing the accuracy of species distribution models: Prevalence, kappa and the true skill statistic (TSS), Journal of Applied Ecology, 43, 6, pp. 1223-1232, (2006); Ancillotto, Leonardo, An overlooked invader?

This study investigates the spatiotemporal patterns of changes in land covers, forest harvest areas and soil erosion rates in Nordic countries, namely Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. This region is highly sensitive to environmental changes, as it is experiencing high levels of human pressure and among the highest rates of global warming. An analysis that uses consistent land cover dataset to quantify and compares the recent spatiotemporal changes in land cover in the Nordic countries is missing. The recent products issued by the European Space Agency and the Copernicus Climate Change Service framework provide the possibility to investigate the historical land cover changes from 1992 to 2018 at 300 m resolution. These maps are then integrated with time series of forest harvest areas between 2004 and 2018 to study if and how forest management is represented in land cover products, and with soil erosion data to explore status and recent trends in agricultural land. Land cover changes typically involved from 4% to 9% of the total area in each country. Wetland showed the strongest reduction (11,003 km2, −11% of the wetland area in 1992), followed by forest (8,607 km2, −1%) and sparse vegetation (5,695 km2, −7%), while agriculture (15,884 km2, 16%) and settlement (3,582 km2, 84%) showed net increases. Wetland shrinkage dominated land cover changes in Norway (5,870 km2, −18%), followed by forest and grassland with a net gain of 3,441 km2 (3%) and 3, 435 km2 (10%), respectively. In Sweden, forest areas decreased 13,008 km2 (−4%), mainly due to agriculture expansion (9,211 km2, 29%). In Finland, agricultural areas increased by 5,982 km2 (24%), and wetland decreased by 6,698 km2 (−22%). Settlement had the largest net growth in Denmark (717 km2, 70%), mainly from conversion of agriculture land. Soil erosion rates in Nordic countries are lower than the global average, but they are exacerbating in several locations (especially western Norway). The integration of the land cover datasets with maps of forest harvest areas shows that the majority of the losses in forest cover due to forestry operations are largely undetected, but a non-negligible share of the forest-to-agriculture (up to 19%) or forest-to-grassland (up to 51%) transitions overlap with the harvested sites. Forestry activity in the study region primarily involves small-scale harvest events that are difficult to be detected at the 300 m resolution of the land cover dataset. An accurate representation of forest management remains a challenge for global datasets of land cover time series, and more interdisciplinary international efforts are needed to address this gap. Overall, this analysis provides a detailed overview of recent changes in land cover and forest management in Nordic countries as represented by state-of-the-art global datasets, and offers insights to future studies aiming to improve these data or apply them in land surface models, climate models, landscape ecology, or other applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forest Management; Land Cover Changes; Soil Erosion; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Environmental Change; Erosion Rate; Forest Management; Global Warming; Land Cover; Soil Erosion; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Trend Analysis; Denmark; Finland; Norway; Sweden","environmental change; erosion rate; forest management; global warming; land cover; soil erosion; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; Denmark; Finland; Norway; Sweden","","","This research was funded by the Norwegian Research Council (Grant No. 286773), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41861134038) through the CHINOR bilateral research project MitiStress, China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 201906410051) and the Fundamental Research Funds for National Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) (Grant No. 2201710266).

Known as the Ramgarh (impact) structure, this landform was first noticed in 1869. Although the possibility of its meteorite impact origin was mentioned as early as 1972, it was described as a tectonic “dome structure,” in the absence of any clinching evidence. Geological and geophysical investigations carried out during the last decades have pointed out features typical of a terrestrial meteorite impact, such as a well-preserved circular shape with an uplifted central depression, steep inner slopes of the ridge compared to outer slopes, intense brecciation, fracturing, and faulting, and most important, identification of planar deformation features in quartz, diagnostic of shock metamorphism. Therefore, the structure has recently been recognized as a confirmed “meteorite impact structure” from India and listed in the global database on impact structures. The central depression of the structure is also the site for a tenth century Khajuraho-style temple complex. Besides, there are two cave temples on the inner slope of the eastern rim of the structure, a cultural cum pilgrimage center. The ruins of a fort at the southern outer slope of the structure represent yet another object of archeological/historic interest. The two water bodies in the central depression, filled with the rainwater drained from the surrounding slopes, are the abode for several species of migratory birds. Thus, the “impact structure” provides scientific, archeological, historical, cultural, and biodiversity features of common interest in a unified geographic domain, making an appropriate case for consideration and accreditation as “geopark.” Although the structure is listed amongst 34 geoheritage sites/geological monuments by the Geological Survey of India, the efforts have not been translated into any action on the ground in terms of developing it as a geopark. In this contribution, we provide geological and geomorphological characteristics of this structure, and in conjunction with the other wide-ranging aspects, propose recognition of this well-preserved “meteorite impact structure” as a “geoheritage site/geopark.” © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bhander Group; Central Uplift; Geodiversity; Geopark; North-central India; Planar Deformation Features; Ramgarh Impact Structure; Biodiversity; Geomorphological Feature; Landform; Meteorite; Rainwater; Tectonic Feature; Topographic Effect; Central Department; India; Khajuraho; Madhya Pradesh; Rajasthan","biodiversity; geomorphological feature; landform; meteorite; rainwater; tectonic feature; topographic effect; Central Department; India; Khajuraho; Madhya Pradesh; Rajasthan","","","","Agarwal, Amar K., Evidence for shock provides insight into the formation of the central elevated area in the Dhala impact structure, India, Meteoritics and Planetary Science, 55, 12, pp. 2772-2779, (2020); Curr Sci, (1974); Mem Geol Surv India, (1933); Balasundaram, M.

Recent methodological proposals for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), evaluate water use impacts on freshwater habitats based on river hydraulic parameters alterations. However, they are limited to French rivers due to lack of global data and models. On this basis, this article proposes an approach to compute regionalized characterization factors for modeling river habitat change potential (HCP) induced by water consumption, potentially applicable worldwide. A simplified model is developed for fish guilds and invertebrates. Based on French datasets, it establishes a relationship between HCP and river hydraulic parameters. A methodology to derive discharge and hydraulic geometry at the reach scale is proposed and applied to European and Middle Eastern rivers below 60°N latitude. Regionalized HCPs are calculated at the river reach scale and aggregated at watershed. Then, the impact of agricultural water use in contrasted European and Middle Eastern countries is evaluated comparing the outcomes from the HCP and the Available Water Remaining (AWARE) models at the national scale, considering water supply mix data. The same analysis is carried out on selected river basins. Finally, result consistency, uncertainty and global applicability of the overall approach are discussed. The study demonstrates the reproducibility of the impact model developed for French rivers on any hydrographic network where comparable ecological, hydrological and hydraulic conditions are met. Furthermore, it highlights the need to characterize impacts at a higher spatial resolution in areas where HCP is higher. Large scale quantification of HCP opens the way to the operationalization of mechanistic LCIA models in which the habitat preferences of freshwater species are taken into account to assess the impacts of water consumption on biodiversity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity; Freshwater Habitat; Life Cycle Impact Assessment; Water Consumption; Climate Change; Ecosystems; Life Cycle; Rivers; Uncertainty Analysis; Water Supply; Watersheds; Assessment Models; Freshwater Habitats; Global Value Chain; Habitat Change; High Resolution; Hydraulic Parameters; Life Cycle Impact Assessment; River Hydraulics; Water Consumption; Waters Resources; Biodiversity; Fresh Water; Biodiversity; Environmental Change; Freshwater Environment; Habitat Quality; Habitat Selection; Hydraulics; Life Cycle Analysis; Resource Availability; Water Supply; Water Use; Agriculture; Article; Climate Change; Data Consistency; Environmental Impact Assessment; European; Fish; France; Freshwater Species; Geometry; Habitat; Hydrography; Invertebrate; Life Cycle Assessment; Middle East; Priority Journal; Reproducibility; River; River Basin; Statistical Model; Water Management; Watershed; Europe; Invertebrata","Climate change; Ecosystems; Life cycle; Rivers; Uncertainty analysis; Water supply; Watersheds; Assessment models; Freshwater habitats; Global value chain; Habitat change; High resolution; Hydraulic parameters; Life cycle impact assessment; River hydraulics; Water consumption; Waters resources; Biodiversity; fresh water; biodiversity; environmental change; freshwater environment; habitat quality; habitat selection; hydraulics; life cycle analysis; resource availability; water supply; water use; agriculture; Article; climate change; data consistency; environmental impact assessment; European; fish; France; freshwater species; geometry; habitat; hydrography; invertebrate; life cycle assessment; Middle East; priority journal; reproducibility; river; river basin; statistical model; water management; watershed; Europe; Invertebrata","","","The authors are grateful to all members of the ELSA research group for their advice (Environmental Life Cycle and Sustainability Assessment, http://www.elsa-lca.org/ ).

In most part of the research, the environment is assumed to be static, while the dynamic parts of the environment degrade the estimation quality of SLAM algorithms and lead to inherently fragile systems. To enhance the performance and robustness of the SLAM in dynamic environments (SLAMIDE), a novel cooperative approach named parallel-map (p-map) SLAM is introduced in this paper. The objective of the proposed method is to deal with the dynamics of the environment, by detecting dynamic parts and preventing the inclusion of them in SLAM estimations. In this approach, each robot builds a limited map in its own vicinity, while the global map is built through a hybrid centralized MRSLAM. The restricted size of the local maps, bounds computational complexity and resources needed to handle a large scale dynamic environment. Using a probabilistic index, the proposed method differentiates between stationary and moving landmarks, based on their relative positions with other parts of the environment. Stationary landmarks are then used to refine a consistent map. The proposed method is evaluated with different levels of dynamism and for each level, the performance is measured in terms of accuracy, robustness, and hardware resources needed to be implemented. The method is also evaluated with a publicly available real-world data-set. Experimental validation along with simulations indicate that the proposed method is able to perform consistent SLAM in a dynamic environment, suggesting its feasibility for MRSLAM applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic Environment; Multi-robot Slam; Parallel Maps; Robot Navigation; Agricultural Robots; Industrial Robots; Multipurpose Robots; Dynamic Environments; Estimation Quality; Experimental Validations; Hardware Resources; Hybrid Centralized; Large-scale Dynamics; Relative Positions; Simultaneous Localization And Mapping; Slam Robotics","Agricultural robots; Industrial robots; Multipurpose robots; Dynamic environments; Estimation quality; Experimental validations; Hardware resources; Hybrid centralized; Large-scale dynamics; Relative positions; Simultaneous localization and mapping; SLAM robotics","","","","Cadena, Cesar, Past, present, and future of simultaneous localization and mapping: Toward the robust-perception age, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 32, 6, pp. 1309-1332, (2016); Bresson, Guillaume, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping: A Survey of Current Trends in Autonomous Driving, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, 2, 3, pp. 194-220, (2017); Fuentes-Pacheco, Jorge Alberto, Visual simultaneous localization and mapping: a survey, Artificial Intelligence Review, 43, 1, pp. 55-81, (2015); Zhang, Tianwei, Humanoid Robot RGB-D SLAM in the Dynamic Human Environment, International Journal of Humanoid Robotics, 17, 2, (2020); Hornung, Armin, Monte carlo localization for humanoid robot navigation in complex indoor environments, International Journal of Humanoid Robotics, 11, 2, (2014); Howard, Andrew B., Multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping using particle filters, International Journal of Robotics Research, 25, 12, pp. 1243-1256, (2006); Gil, A., Multi-robot visual SLAM using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 58, 1, pp. 68-80, (2010); Zamora, Erik, Recent advances on simultaneous localization and mapping for mobile robots, IETE Technical Review (Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers, India), 30, 6, pp. 490-496, (2013); Liu, Qiang, Robust Loop Closure Detection Using Bayes Filters and CNN Features, International Journal of Humanoid Robotics, 18, 5, (2021); Saeedi, Sajad, Multiple-Robot Simultaneous Localization and Mapping: A Review, Journal of Field Robotics, 33, 1, pp. 3-46, (2016)","","World Scientific","","","","","","02198436; 17936942","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114607220"

Methods for measuring this impact have been under development for over a decade, with the Available Water Remaining (AWARE) method being the current consensus approach. Available characterisation factors rely on global databases, which are built from potentially inappropriate information. This analysis aims to develop AWARE factors specific to Australian basins using the most recent meteorological data and water consumption statistics available. Australian cotton cropping is used as a case study in the application of the newly developed characterisation factors, and a cotton-specific characterisation factor is developed. Methods: The analysis involved the compilation of meteorological data quantifying water run-off and statistical data on domestic, industrial and agricultural water consumption. A geographical information system (GIS) software was used to map the information at the Australian basin level. The information was used to develop a set of monthly and annual characterisation factors for each basin and at the country level, using the AWARE method. All underpinning information is available in a public repository. A cotton-specific AWARE factor was calculated based on land cropped and average irrigation requirements over the past 10 years. Results and discussion: Comparing the data collected for this analysis with the data underpinning the current AWARE factors revealed some significant disparities. Using up-to-date statistics suggests that irrigation water requirements are 72% lower than the value currently used in AWARE, and that the characterisation factor for Australia should be up to 35% lower than currently reported. Basin definition was reviewed to align with the Life Cycle Inventory work conducted in Australia as part of AusLCI, so that characterisation factors correspond to the elementary flows defined in the Australian database of inventories. The new breakdown provides more granularity in the Murray-Darling division, where two-thirds of Australian irrigation water is consumed. Using the updated data to develop a factor for cotton shows a 20% reduction against using the current factors. Conclusions: The use of up-to-date water availability and consumption data for Australia would increase the robustness of the current AWARE impact assessment method for the region. All collected information was compiled to be easily updated for future iteration. The factors could be integrated in the global database of AWARE factors, though there may be inherent complexities in this process due to the variations in the geographical definitions of basins. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Australia; Aware; Impact Assessment Method; Water Footprint; Water Scarcity; Agricultural Procedures; Analytic Method; Article; Australia; Case Study; Crop Management; Data Analysis; Data Base; Fluid Intake; Geographic Information System; Information Processing; Irrigation (agriculture); Mathematical Computing; Meteorological Phenomena; Program Development; Quantitative Analysis; Reduction (chemistry); Water Availability; Water Insecurity","agricultural procedures; analytic method; Article; Australia; case study; crop management; data analysis; data base; fluid intake; geographic information system; information processing; irrigation (agriculture); mathematical computing; meteorological phenomena; program development; quantitative analysis; reduction (chemistry); water availability; water insecurity","","","We acknowledge the support of the Cotton Research and Development Centre in conducting this research.","Alcamo, Joseph M., Development and testing of the WaterGAP 2 global model of water use and availability, Hydrological Sciences Journal, 48, 3, pp. 317-337, (2003); Australian Life Cycle Inventory Database Auslci Version 1, (2020); Alves, Kilvia De Freitas, Water scarcity in Brazil: part 2—uncertainty assessment in regionalized characterization factors, International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 25, 12, pp. 2359-2379, (2020); Andrade, Edilene Pereira, Water scarcity in Brazil: part 1—regionalization of the AWARE model characterization factors, International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 25, 12, pp. 2342-2358, (2020); Australian Bureau of Statistics Canberra Australia, (2010); Australian Bureau of Statistics Canberra Australia, (2013); Australian Bureau of Statistics Canberra Australia, (2014); Australian Bureau of Statistics Canberra Australia, (2015); Australian Bureau of Statistics Canberra Australia, (2016); Australian Bureau of Statistics Canberra Australia, (2016)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","09483349; 16147502","","IJLCF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110365638"

The recent revolution in big data and Internet-of-Things (IoT) provides unprecedented benefits including optimizing yield, minimizing environmental impact, and reducing cost. However, the mass collection of farm data in IoT applications raises serious concerns about potential privacy leakage that may harm the farmers' welfare. In this work, we propose a novel scalable and private geo-distance evaluation system, called SPRIDE, to allow application servers to provide geographic-based services by computing the distances among sensors and farms privately. The servers determine the distances without learning any additional information about their locations. The key idea of SPRIDE is to perform efficient distance measurement and distance comparison on encrypted locations over a sphere by leveraging a homomorphic cryptosystem. To serve a large user base, we further propose SPRIDE+ with novel and practical performance enhancements based on pre-computation of cryptographic elements. Through extensive experiments using real-world datasets, we show SPRIDE+ achieves private distance evaluation on a large network of farms, attaining 3+ times runtime performance improvement over existing techniques. We further show SPRIDE+ can run on resource-constrained mobile devices, which offers a practical solution for privacy-preserving precision agriculture IoT applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distance Evaluation; Iot; Precision Agriculture; Privacy-preserving Data Analysis; Agricultural Robots; Cryptography; Environmental Impact; Large Dataset; Precision Agriculture; Privacy By Design; Application Servers; Homomorphic Cryptosystem; Internet Of Things (iot); Modern Agricultures; Performance Enhancements; Practical Solutions; Real-world Datasets; Run-time Performance; Internet Of Things","Agricultural robots; Cryptography; Environmental impact; Large dataset; Precision agriculture; Privacy by design; Application Servers; Homomorphic cryptosystem; Internet of Things (IOT); Modern agricultures; Performance enhancements; Practical solutions; Real-world datasets; Run-time performance; Internet of things","","","This article is extended from a conference paper published at IEEE CNS 2017.

Indeed, human-altered land uses favour species able to tolerate greater temperature and precipitation extremes. However, environmental changes do not impact species uniformly across their distributions, and most research exploring the impacts of climatic changes driven by land use has not considered potential within-range variation. We explored whether a population's climatic position (the difference between species' thermal and precipitation tolerance limits and the environmental conditions a population experiences) influences their relative abundance across land-use types. Location: Global. Methods: Using a global dataset of terrestrial vertebrate species and estimating their realized climatic tolerance limits, we analysed how the abundance of species within human-altered habitats relative to that in natural habitats varied across different climatic positions (controlling for proximity to geographic range edge). Results: A population's thermal position strongly influenced abundance within human-altered land uses (e.g. agriculture). Where temperature extremes were closer to species' thermal limits, population abundances were lower in human-altered land uses (relative to natural habitat) compared to areas further from these limits. These effects were generally stronger at tropical compared to temperate latitudes. In contrast, the influences of precipitation position were more complex and often differed between land uses and geographic zones. Mapping the outcome of models revealed strong spatial variation in the potential severity of decline for vertebrate populations following conversion from natural habitat to cropland or pasture, due to their climatic position. Main conclusions: We highlight within-range variation in species' responses to land use, driven (at least partly), by differences in climatic position. Accounting for spatial variation in responses to environmental changes is critical when predicting population vulnerability, producing successful conservation plans, and exploring how biodiversity may be impacted by future land-use and climate change interactions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity; Climate Change; Climatic Position; Cropland; Global; Land-use Change; Precipitation; Temperature; Thermal Tolerances; Abundance; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Community Composition; Environmental Change; Environmental Conditions; Human Activity; Land Use Change; Relative Abundance; Vertebrate; Vertebrata","abundance; climate change; climate effect; community composition; environmental change; environmental conditions; human activity; land use change; relative abundance; vertebrate; Vertebrata","","","Funding text 1: We thank Richard Pearson, Kate Jones, Jeremy Kerr and Peter Soroye for useful discussions during the production of this manuscript.

However, correlations between culture and environment are difficult to interpret, because many cultural traits are inherited together from shared ancestors, neighbouring cultures are exposed to similar conditions, and many cultural and environmental variables show strong covariation. Here, using a global dataset of 33,750 recipes from 70 cuisines containing 93 different spices, we demonstrate that variation in spice use is not explained by temperature and that spice use cannot be accounted for by diversity of cultures, plants, crops or naturally occurring spices. Patterns of spice use are not consistent with an infection-mitigation mechanism, but are part of a broader association between spice, health, and poverty. This study highlights the challenges inherent in interpreting patterns of human cultural variation in terms of evolutionary pressures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity; Book; Climate; Crop; Cultural Anthropology; Cultural Diversity; Environment; Food; Human; Risk Reduction; Socioeconomics; Spice; Biodiversity; Climate; Cookbooks As Topic; Crops, Agricultural; Cultural Diversity; Cultural Evolution; Culture; Economic Factors; Environment; Food; Humans; Infections; Risk Reduction Behavior; Socioeconomic Factors; Spices","biodiversity; book; climate; crop; cultural anthropology; cultural diversity; environment; food; human; risk reduction; socioeconomics; spice; Biodiversity; Climate; Cookbooks as Topic; Crops, Agricultural; Cultural Diversity; Cultural Evolution; Culture; Economic Factors; Environment; Food; Humans; Infections; Risk Reduction Behavior; Socioeconomic Factors; Spices","","","","Sherman, Paul W., Darwinian gastronomy: Why we use spices: Spices taste good because they are good for us, BioScience, 49, 6, pp. 453-463, (1999); Billing, Jennifer, Antimicrobial functions of spices: Why some like it hot, Quarterly Review of Biology, 73, 1, pp. 3-38, (1998); Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, (1889); Bromham, Lindell D., Parasites and politics: Why cross-cultural studies must control for relatedness, proximity and covariation, Royal Society Open Science, 5, 8, (2018); Mace, Ruth H., A phylogenetic approach to cultural evolution, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 20, 3, pp. 116-121, (2005); Freckleton, Robert P., Space versus phylogeny: Disentangling phylogenetic and spatial signals in comparative data, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 276, 1654, pp. 21-30, (2009); Hua, Xia, The ecological drivers of variation in global language diversity, Nature Communications, 10, 1, (2019); Ohtsubo, Yohsuke, Adaptive ingredients against food spoilage in Japanese cuisine, International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition, 60, 8, pp. 677-687, (2009); Murray, Damian R., Historical prevalence of infectious diseases within 230 geopolitical regions: A tool for investigating origins of culture, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 41, 1, pp. 99-108, (2010); Sherman, Paul W., Why vegetable recipes are not very spicy, Evolution and Human Behavior, 22, 3, pp. 147-163, (2001)","","Nature Research","","","","","","23973374","","","33542529","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100453951"

Over-fertilization can have negative influences on the field and the regional level (e.g., agro-ecosys-tems). Remote sensing of the plant N of field crops presents a valuable tool for the monitoring of N flows in agro-ecosystems. Available data for validation of satellite-based remote sensing of N is scarce. Therefore, in this study, field spectrometer measurements were used to simulate data of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites developed for vegetation monitoring by the ESA. The prediction performance of normalized ratio indices (NRIs), random forest regression (RFR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for plant-N-related traits was assessed on a diverse real-world dataset including multiple crops, field sites and years. The plant N traits included the mass-based N measure, N concentration in the biomass (Nconc), and an area-based N measure approximating the plant N uptake (NUP). Spectral indices such as normalized ratio indices (NRIs) performed well, but the RFR and GPR methods outperformed the NRIs. Key spectral bands for each trait were identified using the RFR variable importance measure and the Gaussian processes regression band analysis tool (GPR-BAT), highlighting the importance of the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region for estimation of plant Nconc—and to a lesser extent the NUP. The red edge (RE) region was also important. The GPR-BAT showed that five bands were sufficient for plant N trait and leaf area index (LAI) estimation and that a surplus of bands effectively reduced prediction performance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed on all traits simultaneously, showing the dominance of the LAI in the mixed remote sensing signal. To delineate the plant-N-related traits from this signal, regional and/or national data collection campaigns producing large crop spectral libraries (CSL) are needed. An improved database will likely enable the mapping of N at the agro-ecosystem level or for use in precision farming by farmers in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agro-ecosystem Monitoring; Artmo Toolbox; Chlorophyll; Gaussian Processes Regression; Leaf Area Index; Nitrogen; Random Forest; Spectral Indices; Agricultural Robots; Crops; Decision Trees; Ecosystems; Gaussian Distribution; Gaussian Noise (electronic); Infrared Radiation; Nitrogen; Sensitivity Analysis; Spectrometers; Agricultural Productions; Field Spectrometer Measurements; Gaussian Processes Regressions; Gaussian Processes Regressions (gpr); Global Sensitivity Analysis; Prediction Performance; Short Wave Infrared Regions; Vegetation Monitoring; Remote Sensing","Agricultural robots; Crops; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Infrared radiation; Nitrogen; Sensitivity analysis; Spectrometers; Agricultural productions; Field spectrometer measurements; Gaussian processes regressions; Gaussian processes regressions (GPR); Global sensitivity analysis; Prediction performance; Short wave infrared regions; Vegetation monitoring; Remote sensing","","","Funding text 1: Funding: We acknowledge support from the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture (Bundesamt für Landwirtschaft, BLW) for funding this work as part of the project ‘DeepField’.

Among all the organisms that are beneficial to humans, plants stand out as the most important providers of natural resources. Therefore, identifying plant uses is critical to preserve the beneficial potential of biodiversity and to promote basic and applied research on the relationship between plants and humans. However, much of this information is often uncritical, contradictory, of dubious value or simply not readily accessible to the great majority of scientists and policy makers. Here, we compiled a genus-level dataset of plant-use records for all accepted vascular plant taxa (13489 genera) using the information gathered in the 4th Edition of Mabberley’s plant-book, the most comprehensive global review of plant classification and their uses published to date. From 1974 to 2017 all the information was systematically gathered, evaluated, and synthesized by David Mabberley, who reviewed over 1000 botanical sources including modern Floras, monographs, periodicals, handbooks, and authoritative websites. Plant uses were arranged across 28 standard categories of use following the Economic Botany Data Collection Standard guidelines, which resulted in a binary classification of 9478 plant-use records pertaining human and animal nutrition, materials, fuels, medicine, poisons, social and environmental uses. Of all the taxa included in the dataset, 33% were assigned to at least one category of use, the most common being “ornamental” (26%), “medicine” (16%), “human food” (13%) and “timber” (8%). In addition to a readily available binary matrix for quantitative analyses, we provide a control text matrix that links the former to the description of the uses in Mabberley’s plant-book. We hope this dataset will serve to establish synergies between scientists and policy makers interested in plant-human interactions and to move towards the complete compilation and classification of the nature’s contributions to people upon which the wellbeing of future generations may depend. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fuel; Animal Food; Article; Biodiversity; Book; Botany; Data Base; Environmental Factor; Human; Natural Resource; Nonhuman; Organismal Interaction; Ornamental Species; Preservation; Public Policy; Publication; Scientist; Social Aspect; Vascular Plant; Wellbeing; Agriculture; Classification; Factual Database; Human Activities; Information Processing; Legislation And Jurisprudence; Agriculture; Data Curation; Data Management; Databases, Factual; Human Activities; Humans; Tracheophyta","fuel; animal food; Article; biodiversity; book; botany; data base; environmental factor; human; natural resource; nonhuman; organismal interaction; ornamental species; preservation; public policy; publication; scientist; social aspect; vascular plant; wellbeing; agriculture; classification; factual database; human activities; information processing; legislation and jurisprudence; Agriculture; Data Curation; Data Management; Databases, Factual; Human Activities; Humans; Tracheophyta","","","","Global Biodiversity Outlook, (2020); Phang, Suichian, Addressing the implementation challenge of the global biodiversity framework, Biodiversity and Conservation, 29, 9-10, pp. 3061-3066, (2020); Díaz, Sandra M., Set ambitious goals for biodiversity and sustainability, Science, 370, 6515, pp. 411-413, (2020); Ulian, Tiziana, Unlocking plant resources to support food security and promote sustainable agriculture, Plants People Planet, 2, 5, pp. 421-445, (2020); Hiscock, Simon J., Plants matter: Introducing Plants, People, Planet, Plants People Planet, 1, 1, pp. 2-4, (2019); Gaston, Kevin J., People and Nature—A journal of relational thinking, People and Nature, 1, 1, pp. 4-5, (2019); Martín-López, Berta, Ecosystems and People–an inclusive, interdisciplinary journal, Ecosystems and People, 15, 1, pp. 1-2, (2019); Díaz, Sandra M., Assessing nature’s contributions to people: Recognizing culture, and diverse sources of knowledge, can improve assessments, Science, 359, 6373, pp. 270-272, (2018); Cámara-Leret, Rodrigo, Fundamental species traits explain provisioning services of tropical American palms, Nature Plants, 3, (2017); van Kleunen, Mark, Economic use of plants is key to their naturalization success, Nature Communications, 11, 1, (2020)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","34129629","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107986510"

These ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems can store large amounts of carbon for long periods, and their protection reduces greenhouse gas emissions and supports climate change mitigation. Incorporating mangroves into Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement and their valuation on carbon markets requires predicting how the management of different land-uses can prevent future greenhouse gas emissions and increase CO<inf>2</inf> sequestration. We integrated comprehensive global datasets for carbon stocks, mangrove distribution, deforestation rates, and land-use change drivers into a predictive model of mangrove carbon emissions. We project emissions and foregone soil carbon sequestration potential under ‘business as usual’ rates of mangrove loss. Emissions from mangrove loss could reach 2391 Tg CO<inf>2 eq</inf> by the end of the century, or 3392 Tg CO<inf>2 eq</inf> when considering foregone soil carbon sequestration. The highest emissions were predicted in southeast and south Asia (West Coral Triangle, Sunda Shelf, and the Bay of Bengal) due to conversion to aquaculture or agriculture, followed by the Caribbean (Tropical Northwest Atlantic) due to clearing and erosion, and the Andaman coast (West Myanmar) and north Brazil due to erosion. Together, these six regions accounted for 90% of the total potential CO<inf>2 eq</inf> future emissions. Mangrove loss has been slowing, and global emissions could be more than halved if reduced loss rates remain in the future. Notably, the location of global emission hotspots was consistent with every dataset used to calculate deforestation rates or with alternative assumptions about carbon storage and emissions. Our results indicate the regions in need of policy actions to address emissions arising from mangrove loss and the drivers that could be managed to prevent them. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blue Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Coastal Wetlands; Erosion; Greenhouse Gases; Nationally Determined Contributions; Tropical Storms; Carbon; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Emission; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Coastal Wetland; Environmental Management; Future Prospect; Greenhouse Gas; Mangrove; Prediction; Andaman Sea; Bay Of Bengal; Brazil; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Sunda Shelf; Matthiola; Rhizophoraceae; Carbon; Asia; Caribbean; Ecosystem; France; Wetland; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Caribbean Region; Ecosystem; Paris; Wetlands","carbon cycle; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; coastal wetland; environmental management; future prospect; greenhouse gas; mangrove; prediction; Andaman Sea; Bay of Bengal; Brazil; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Sunda Shelf; Matthiola; Rhizophoraceae; carbon; Asia; Caribbean; ecosystem; France; wetland; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Caribbean Region; Ecosystem; Paris; Wetlands","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon","We acknowledge support from the Global Wetlands Project, supported by a charitable organisation which neither seeks nor permits publicity for its efforts.

On this basis, the greenbelt suitability index (SI) and the environmental change index (ΔY) of the urban sprawl were estimated for the present and future periods. The research modeling was constructed based on some global datasets and factors (i.e., elevation, slope, soil, land use, land cover, agriculture, precipitation, river and road networks, and settlement sprawl) to evaluate greenbelt suitability. Spatial modeling revealed the highest greenbelt suitability (with SI values above 0.8) for the hinterlands of eight cities, including Hamadan, Zanjan, Sanandaj, Rasht, Sari, Gorgan, Qazvin, and Kermanshah. Results also revealed the estimated ΔY values of the urban sprawl between 0.07 and 2.32 for all case studies, relating to a mean sprawl disturbance (ΔX) of 0.27 in the status quo (2018). In the probable future time (2030), the ΔY values were estimated between 0.68 and 5.89 with a mean sprawl disturbance (ΔX) of 0.73 for all case studies, revealing a large increase in the thresholds of the environmental change index.

To provide these, regional atmospheric models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, need to be optimized in their physical setup to the region of interest. The objective of this study is to evaluate four cumulus physics (CU), two microphysics (MP), two planetary boundary layer physics (PBL), and two radiation physics (RA) schemes in WRF according to their performance in dynamically downscaling the precipitation over two typical South American regions: one orographically complex area in Ecuador/Peru (horizontal resolution up to 9 and 3 km), and one area of rolling hills in Northeast Brazil (up to 9 km). For this, an extensive ensemble of 32 simulations over two continuous years was conducted. Including the reference uncertainty of three high-resolution global datasets (CHIRPS, MSWEP, ERA5-Land), we show that different parameterization setups can produce up to four times the monthly reference precipitation. This underscores the urgent need to conduct parameterization sensitivity studies before weather forecasts or input for impact modeling can be produced. Contrarily to usual studies, we focus on distributional, temporal and spatial precipitation patterns and evaluate these in an ensemble-tailored approach. These ensemble characteristics such as ensemble Structure-, Amplitude-, and Location-error, allow us to generalize the impacts of combining one parameterization scheme with others. We find that varying the CU and RA schemes stronger affects the WRF performance than varying the MP or PBL schemes. This effect is even present in the convection-resolving 3-km-domain over Ecuador/Peru where CU schemes are only used in the parent domain of the one-way nesting approach. The G3D CU physics ensemble best represents the CHIRPS probability distribution in the 9-km-domains. However, spatial and temporal patterns of CHIRPS are best captured by Tiedtke or BMJ CU schemes. Ecuadorian station data in the 3-km-domain is best simulated by the ensemble whose parent domains use the KF CU scheme. Accounting for all evaluation metrics, no general-purpose setup could be identified, but suited parameterizations can be narrowed down according to final application needs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chirps 2.0; Ecuador; Esal; Northeast Brazil; Parameterizations; Peru; Sensitivity; Weather Research And Forecasting (wrf) Model; Boundary Layers; Chirp Modulation; Climate Models; Copper; Image Segmentation; Parameterization; Probability Distributions; Water Management; Weather Forecasting; Chirps 2.0; Ecuador; Esal; High Resolution; Microphysics; Northeast Brazil; Peru; Planetary Boundary Layers; Sensitivity; Weather Research And Forecasting Models; Decision Making; Climate Variation; Decision Making; Downscaling; Parameterization; Precipitation Assessment; Sensitivity Analysis; Water Management; Weather Forecasting; Brazil","Boundary layers; Chirp modulation; Climate models; Copper; Image segmentation; Parameterization; Probability distributions; Water management; Weather forecasting; CHIRPS 2.0; Ecuador; ESAL; High resolution; Microphysics; Northeast Brazil; Peru; Planetary boundary layers; Sensitivity; Weather research and forecasting models; Decision making; climate variation; decision making; downscaling; parameterization; precipitation assessment; sensitivity analysis; water management; weather forecasting; Brazil","","","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the Gauss Center for Supercomputing e.V.

Tractor usage is not easy to assess due to the large variability of field operations. However, modern tractors embed sensors integrated into the CAN-BUS network and their data is accessible through the ISO 11,783 protocol. Even though this technology has been available for a long time, the use of CAN-BUS data for outlining the tractor usage is still limited, because a proper post-processing method is lacking. This study aimed to present a novel classification scheme of CAN-BUS data which permits to outline the tractor usage. On a tractor, a CAN-BUS data logger and a GNSS receiver were installed, and real-world data were recorded for 579 h. Thus, data was obtained in the most realistic condition. Tractor positions were classified using GIS layers while operating conditions were classified depending on the usage of the tractor's subsystems. The method highlights that showed to be able to detect the 97% of the logged data and that the tractor operated on the field in working, on idle, and moving duties for 65%, 18% and 16% of the time, respectively. The method allows a far more precise outline of tractor usage opening opportunities to obtain large benefits from massively collected CAN-BUS data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture 4.0; Can-bus; Data Mining; Real-world Data; Task Classification; Buses; Classification (of Information); Data Analytics; Data Mining; Global Positioning System; Machine Design; Technology Transfer; Agriculture 4.0; Can Bus; Classifieds; Data Analytics; Field Operation; Mission Profile; Optimal Machine Designs; Postprocessing Methods; Real-world Data; Task Classification; Agriculture; Data Set; Detection Method; Gis; Gnss; Satellite Data; Trachinotus Falcatus","Buses; Classification (of information); Data Analytics; Data mining; Global positioning system; Machine design; Technology transfer; Agriculture 4.0; CAN bus; Classifieds; Data analytics; Field operation; Mission profile; Optimal machine designs; Postprocessing methods; Real-world data; Task classification; Agriculture; data set; detection method; GIS; GNSS; satellite data; Trachinotus falcatus","","","This project was supported within the PRIN national framework by MUR (Ministry of University and Research), notification 2015 “Optimization of operating machinery through analysis of the mission profile for more efficient agriculture” Grant number: 2015KTY5NW.","Agricultural Machinery Management Data, (2006); Balsari, Paolo, Performance analysis of a tractor - power harrow system under different working conditions, Biosystems Engineering, 202, pp. 28-41, (2021); Bishop, Justin D.K., A robust, data-driven methodology for real-world driving cycle development, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 17, 5, pp. 389-397, (2012); Calcante, Aldo, Design, development and evaluation of a wireless system for the automatic identification of implements, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 101, pp. 118-127, (2014); undefined, (2019); Ettl, Johannes, Transfer of agricultural work operation profiles to a tractor test stand for exhaust emission evaluation, Biosystems Engineering, 176, pp. 185-197, (2018); Fugiglando, Umberto, Driving Behavior Analysis through CAN Bus Data in an Uncontrolled Environment, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 20, 2, pp. 737-748, (2019); Harmon, Joshua D., Time-motion analysis of forage harvest: A case study, Transactions of the ASABE, 61, 2, pp. 483-491, (2018); Hodge, Victoria J., A survey of outlier detection methodologies, Artificial Intelligence Review, 22, 2, pp. 85-126, (2004); Farm Power and Machinery Management, (1995)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01681699","","CEAGE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102866981"

Therefore, our aim was to provide projections of future soil microbial distribution using several scenarios of global change. Location: Global. Time period: 1950–2090. Major taxa studied: Bacteria and fungi. Methods: We used a global database of soil microbial communities across six continents to estimate past and future trends of the soil microbiome. To do so, we used structural equation models to include the direct and indirect effects of changes in climate and land use in our predictions, using current climate (temperature and precipitation) and land-use projections between 1950 and 2090. Results: Local bacterial richness will increase in all scenarios of change in climate and land use considered, although this increase will be followed by a generalized community homogenization process affecting > 85% of terrestrial ecosystems. Changes in the relative abundance of functional genes associated with the increases in bacterial richness are also expected. Based on an ecological cluster analysis, our results suggest that phylotypes such as Geodermatophilus spp. (typical desert bacteria), Mycobacterium sp. (which are known to include important human pathogens), Streptomyces mirabilis (major producers of antibiotic resistance genes) or potential fungal soil-borne plant pathogens belonging to Ascomycota fungi (Venturia spp., Devriesia spp.) will become more abundant in their communities. Main conclusions: Our results provide evidence that climate change has a stronger influence on soil microbial communities than change in land use (often including deforestation and agricultural expansion), although most of the effects of climate are indirect, through other environmental variables (e.g., changes in soil pH). The same was found for microbial functions such as the prevalence of phosphate transport genes. We provide reliable predictions about the changes in the global distribution of microbial communities, showing an increase in alpha diversity and a homogenization of soil microbial communities in the Anthropocene. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity Projections; Ecosystem Functions; Future Of Nature; Soil Bacteria; Soil Governance; Soil Macroecology; Anthropocene; Biodiversity; Ecosystem Function; Future Prospect; Microbial Activity; Microbial Community; Soil Microorganism; Species Richness; Ascomycota; Bacteria (microorganisms); Devriesia; Geodermatophilus; Mycobacterium Sp.; Streptomyces Mirabilis","Anthropocene; biodiversity; ecosystem function; future prospect; microbial activity; microbial community; soil microorganism; species richness; Ascomycota; Bacteria (microorganisms); Devriesia; Geodermatophilus; Mycobacterium sp.; Streptomyces mirabilis","","","Funding text 1: This manuscript was developed from discussions within the German Centre of Integrative Biodiversity Research funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG FZT118).

Based on available databases of cultural landmarks, we selected three pairs of cities that are currently dominated by three contrasting religions (Catholic, Buddhist and emerging culture) to compare the long-term changes in cultural landmarks, to quantify their spatial distribution in the current landscape, and to examine the potential influences these landmarks have on landscapes. The landmark database and landscapes were constructed from archived maps, satellite imagery and the UNESCO heritage sites for Barcelona, Bari, Beijing, Vientiane, Shenzhen, and Ulaanbaatar. Roads in Asian cities are mostly constructed in alignment with the four cardinal directions, forming a checkerboard-type landscape, whereas Bari and Barcelona in Europe have examples of roads radiating from major cultural landmarks. We found clear differences in the number of landmarks and surrounding landscape in these cities, supporting our hypothesis that current urban landscapes have been influenced similarly by cultural landmarks, although substantial differences exist among cities. Negative relationships between the number of cultural landmarks and major cover types were found, except with agricultural lands. Clearly, cultural landmarks need to be treated as “natural features” and considered as reference points in urban planning.

Here we use a global database of pesticide applications and a spatially explicit environmental model to estimate the world geography of environmental pollution risk caused by 92 active ingredients in 168 countries. We considered a region to be at risk of pollution if pesticide residues in the environment exceeded the no-effect concentrations, and to be at high risk if residues exceeded this by three orders of magnitude. We find that 64% of global agricultural land (approximately 24.5 million km2) is at risk of pesticide pollution by more than one active ingredient, and 31% is at high risk. Among the high-risk areas, about 34% are in high-biodiversity regions, 5% in water-scarce areas and 19% in low- and lower-middle-income nations. We identify watersheds in South Africa, China, India, Australia and Argentina as high-concern regions because they have high pesticide pollution risk, bear high biodiversity and suffer from water scarcity. Our study expands earlier pesticide risk assessments as it accounts for multiple active ingredients and integrates risks in different environmental compartments at a global scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Land; Biodiversity; Concentration (composition); Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Risk; Food Production; Global Perspective; Argentina; Australia; China; India; South Africa","agricultural land; biodiversity; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; environmental risk; food production; global perspective; Argentina; Australia; China; India; South Africa","","","This work was supported by the University of Sydney through the SREI2020 EnviroSphere research programme.

Several studies have evaluated manure-related emissions and associated key variables at regional, national, or continental scales. However, there have been few studies focusing on the drivers of these emissions using a global dataset. An international project was created (DATAMAN) to develop a global database on GHG and NH<inf>3</inf> emissions from the manure management chain (housing, storage, and field) to identify key variables influencing emissions and ultimately to refine emission factors (EFs) for future national GHG inventories and NH<inf>3</inf> emission reporting. This paper describes the “field” database that focuses on N<inf>2</inf>O and NH<inf>3</inf> EFs from land-applied manure and excreta deposited by grazing livestock. We collated relevant information (EFs, manure characteristics, soil properties, and climatic conditions) from published peer-reviewed research, conference papers, and existing databases. The database, containing 5,632 observations compiled from 184 studies, was relatively evenly split between N<inf>2</inf>O and NH<inf>3</inf> (56 and 44% of the EF values, respectively). The N<inf>2</inf>O data were derived from studies conducted in 21 countries on five continents, with New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Kenya, and Brazil representing 86% of the data. The NH<inf>3</inf> data originated from studies conducted in 17 countries on four continents, with the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada, and The Netherlands representing 79% of the data.

Drought monitoring is essential for decision-makers seeking to minimize the socio-economic impacts related to drought events. In this study, we propose a methodology to identify the most suitable drought indices and data sources for monitoring the impact of drought on crops. Mozambique is used as a case study, as it represents a challenging example because of its poor hydroclimatic monitoring network and a lack of disaggregated data for agricultural production. A total of seven standardized drought indicators (SPI, SPEI, SSI, SVCI, STCI, SVHI, and STWS) at different scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) were obtained from global databases and evaluated as possible predictors of the annual variability of agricultural yields at the national level. A statistical model of crop yields based on time series was used to measure the explanatory capacity of each index. SPEI and SSI were the most effective at detecting the country's historical drought records regardless of whether nationally averaged values or the percentages of area affected by drought (PAA) were used. However, PAA was found to be a more accurate predictor of variability in crop yields. The variability of most cereals (maize, millet and sorghum) was adequately explained by the PAA of SPEI-3, with that of other crops (cashew nuts, cassava, potatoes, tea, tobacco and vegetables) being explained by the PAA of SSI-12. Specific indicators were proposed for monitoring wheat and sugar cane. These results can directly support managers and decision makers in developing drought contingency plans in Mozambique. To further demonstrate the potential of this methodology, it should be tested in other regions with a greater availability of agricultural data, including spatial disaggregation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crop Yield; Drought Impacts; Drought Index; Mozambique; Statistical Model; Agricultural Robots; Crops; Decision Making; Disasters; Sugar Cane; Tea; Agricultural Productions; Agricultural Yields; Annual Variability; Drought Monitoring; Methodological Frameworks; Socio-economic Impacts; Spatial Disaggregation; Statistical Modeling; Drought; Agricultural Performance; Agricultural Production; Agrometeorology; Cereal; Crop Yield; Decision Making; Drought Stress; Hydrometeorology; Socioeconomic Impact; Mozambique; Anacardium Occidentale; Manihot Esculenta; Nicotiana Tabacum; Saccharum; Solanum Tuberosum","Agricultural robots; Crops; Decision making; Disasters; Sugar cane; Tea; Agricultural productions; Agricultural yields; Annual variability; Drought monitoring; Methodological frameworks; Socio-economic impacts; Spatial disaggregation; Statistical modeling; Drought; agricultural performance; agricultural production; agrometeorology; cereal; crop yield; decision making; drought stress; hydrometeorology; socioeconomic impact; Mozambique; Anacardium occidentale; Manihot esculenta; Nicotiana tabacum; Saccharum; Solanum tuberosum","","","Funding text 1: Ronnie Araneda gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Spanish Regional Government of Galicia (Xunta de Galicia) and the European Union through the predoctoral grant (reference ED481A-2018/162 ).

It aimed at detecting cassava diseases using 5 fine-grained cassava leaf disease categories with 10,000, labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Traditionally, this detection is done mostly through physical inspection and supervision of cassava plants in the garden by farmers or agricultural extension workers from NAADS (National Agricultural Advisory Services) and then reported to NARO (National Agricultural Advisory Services) for further analysis. However, this can be tiresome, capital intensive, and lacks the ability to detect cassava infection timely to help farmers apply preventive techniques to the non-infected cassava plants in order to improve on yields which subsequently increases African food basket leading to food security which fights famine. Using the dataset provided to train CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to achieve high accuracy was very challenging due to two reasons: the dataset was small in size and has high-class imbalance being heavily biased towards CMD (Cassava Mosaic Disease) and CBB (Cassava Brown Streak Virus Disease) classes. Class imbalance is problematic in machine learning and exists in many domains. Note that, not all world data is balanced, in fact, most of the time you will not be extremely lucky to get a perfectly balanced real-world dataset, in recent years, a lot of research has been done for two-class problems such as fraudulent credit card and tumor detection among others. Interestingly, class imbalance in multi-class image datasets has received little attention. This paper, therefore, focused on techniques to achieve an accuracy score of over 93% with class weight, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and focal loss with deep convolutional neural networks from scratch.

One way to solve such a problem is by using an available dataset from the internet. The problem of using an available dataset from the internet creates lots of issues. Major issues are using the dataset from different geographical locations which are deployed at other location, model overfitting due to small-sized dataset etc. The main purpose and experimentation done in this research paper are presenting different techniques to increase the size of the Indian Brinjal dataset so that deep learning models can be improved. Here data augmentation techniques to enhance the small-sized image dataset using rotation, channel shift, width shift, height shift, shear transform, brightness, scaling, uniform aspect ratio, zoom, horizontal flipping, and vertical flipping methods are used. At last, a huge high-quality training dataset of size 39,010 is generated from 350 sample images taken from the real field and 1356 high-quality images are generated to validate the model using above mentioned data augmentation techniques. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","A Survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning Journal of Big Data, (2019); Image Generation from Small Datasets Via Batch Statistics Adaptation, (2019); Comparative Study and Review for Development of Disease Prediction System for Indian Crops Iosr Journal of Computer Engineering Iosr Jce, (2019); Effectiveness of Data Augmentation in Image Classification Using Deep Learning, (2017); undefined; Arxiv, (2017); Development of Intelligent Monitoring Iot Solution for Indian Agriculture Fields; Compacting Neural Network Classifiers Via Dropout Training, (2016); Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, (2017); Convergence Analysis of Batch Normalization for Deep Neural Nets J, (2017)","Manjaiah; Srinath, M.S.; Satyanarayana, K.; Badiger, R.I.","IOP Publishing Ltd","","1st International Conference on Frontiers in Engineering Science and Technology, ICFEST 2020","","Moodbidri, Mangalore; Yenepoya Institute of Technology","167193","1757899X; 17578981","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101624150"

In this context, validation of the global data set is of substance. Remote sensing measurements which are representative of an area covering 100 m2 to tens of km2 rarely match with in situ SM measurements at point scale due to scale difference. In this paper we present the new Indian Cosmic Ray Network (ICON) and compare it’s data with remotely sensed SM at different depths. ICON is the first network in India of the kind. It is operational since 2016 and consist of seven sites equipped with the COSMOS instrument. This instrument is based on the Cosmic Ray Neutron Probe (CRNP) technique which uses non-invasive neutron counts as a measure of soil moisture. It provides in situ measurements over an area with a radius of 150–250 m. This intermediate scale soil moisture is of interest for the validation of satellite SM. We compare the COSMOS derived soil moisture to surface soil moisture (SSM) and root zone soil moisture (RZSM) derived from SMOS, SMAP and GLDAS_Noah. The comparison with surface soil moisture products yield that the SMAP_L4_SSM showed best performance over all the sites with correlation (R) values ranging from 0.76 to 0.90. RZSM on the other hand from all products showed lesser performances. RZSM for GLDAS and SMAP_L4 products show that the results are better for the top layer R = 0.75 to 0.89 and 0.75 to 0.90 respectively than the deeper layers R = 0.26 to 0.92 and 0.6 to 0.8 respectively in all sites in India. The ICON network will be a useful tool for the calibration and validation activities for future SM missions like the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cosmos; Nisar; Smap; Smos; Soil Moisture; Validation; Agricultural Robots; Cosmic Rays; Cosmology; Information Management; Nasa; Remote Sensing; Soil Moisture; Space-based Radar; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Water Management; Agricultural Water; Calibration And Validations; Climate Studies; Cosmic Ray Neutron; In-situ Measurement; Products Yields; Root Zone Soil Moistures; Surface Soil Moisture; Soil Surveys","Agricultural robots; Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Information management; NASA; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Water management; Agricultural water; Calibration and validations; Climate studies; Cosmic ray neutron; In-situ measurement; Products yields; Root zone soil moistures; Surface soil moisture; Soil surveys","","","ICON was setup by the UKCEH SUNRISE programme, which is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) as part of a National Capability Long-Term Science-Official Development Assistance (LTS-ODA) Award.","Evans, Jonathan G., Soil water content in southern England derived from a cosmic-ray soil moisture observing system – COSMOS-UK, Hydrological Processes, 30, 26, pp. 4987-4999, (2016); Bojinski, Stephan, The concept of essential climate variables in support of climate research, applications, and policy, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 95, 9, pp. 1431-1443, (2014); Fereres, E., Deficit irrigation for reducing agricultural water use, Journal of Experimental Botany, 58, 2, pp. 147-159, (2007); Komma, Jürgen, Soil moisture updating by Ensemble Kalman Filtering in real-time flood forecasting, Journal of Hydrology, 357, 3-4, pp. 228-242, (2008); Fan, Lei, Evaluation of microwave remote sensing for monitoring live fuel moisture content in the Mediterranean region, Remote Sensing of Environment, 205, pp. 210-223, (2018); Scale Invariance of Soil Moisture Variability and Its Implications for the Frequency Size Distribution of Landslides, (1997); Hendrickx, Jan M.H., HIGH-resolution soil moisture mapping in Afghanistan, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 8017, (2011); Karthikeyan, Lanka, A review of remote sensing applications in agriculture for food security: Crop growth and yield, irrigation, and crop losses, Journal of Hydrology, 586, (2020); Susha Lekshmi, S.

However, comprehensive water quality datasets are often lacking, thus impeding a full-scale data-based river water quality assessment. Here we propose a model-based approach, using both global datasets and local data to build an evaluation of the potential impact of climate changes and population growth, as well as to verify the efficiency of mitigation measures to curb river water pollution. The upper Awash River catchment in Ethiopia, which drains the city of Addis Ababa as well as many agricultural areas, is used as a case-study. The results show that while decreases in runoff and increases in temperature due to climate change are expected to result in slightly decreased nutrient concentrations, the largest threat to the water quality of the Awash River is population growth, which is expected to increase nutrient loads by 15 to 20% (nitrate) and 30 to 40% (phosphorus) in the river by the second half of the 21st century. Even larger increases are to be expected downstream of large urban areas, such as Addis Ababa. However, improved wastewater treatment options are shown to be efficient in counteracting the negative impact of population growth and returning water pollution to acceptable levels. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Awash River; Climate Change; Ethiopia; Population Growth; Water Quality; Climate Change; Climate Effect; Concentration (composition); Developing World; Environmental Impact Assessment; Nutrient Dynamics; Population Growth; River; River Water; Wastewater Treatment; Water Pollution; Water Quality; Water Resource; Addis Ababa; Awash River; Ethiopia","climate change; climate effect; concentration (composition); developing world; environmental impact assessment; nutrient dynamics; population growth; river; river water; wastewater treatment; water pollution; water quality; water resource; Addis Ababa; Awash River; Ethiopia","","","Acknowledgments: This document is an output from the Oxford University Projects ‘Improving Security for the Poor ‘(REACH) programme funded by UK Aid from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) for the benefit of developing countries (Programme Code 201880).

Unfortunately, most of the ecological local studies are limited to the use of global data with coarse spatial resolutions, while fine-grain climate data are necessary to capture environmental variability and perform reliable modelling. We propose a high-resolution dataset (40 m grid) of the suite of original coarse-grain bioclimatic variables proposed by WorldClim 2 for the island of Sardinia (Italy); variations amongst our dataset and WorldClim 2 were calculated and mapped to show the spatial distribution of differences between all pairs of variables. We observed relevant differences for the bioclimatic variables related to rainfall (mean RMSE = 39.79; mean nRMSE = 0.21) compared to the temperature ones (mean RMSE = 4.81; mean nRMSE = 0.11). Moreover, discrepancies are not evenly distributed in the territory: the greater differences correspond to the areas characterized by complex orographic systems. Results recommend caution in making ecological assessments based on bioclimatic variables derived from global data with coarse spatial resolutions in physiographically complex landscapes, especially in the Mediterranean regions, characterized by seasonal climatic variations and high levels of biodiversity and biogeographical complexity. These new data will support a new generation of research studies in a broad array of ecological applications at a much finer scale than previously possible. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Reliability; Sardinia; Seasonal Climatic Variations; Species Distribution Model; Worldclim; Agricultural Robots; Biodiversity; Conservation; Grain (agricultural Product); Bioclimatic Variables; Biological Science; Climatic Variation; Ecological Modelling; Environmental Variability; High Spatial Resolution; Mediterranean Region; Spatial Resolution; Ecology","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Conservation; Grain (agricultural product); Bioclimatic variables; Biological science; Climatic variation; Ecological modelling; Environmental variability; High spatial resolution; Mediterranean region; Spatial resolution; Ecology","","","","Bacchetta, Gianluigi, A phytosociological study of the Ostrya carpinifolia Scop.

In order to explicitly quantify spatio-temporal variations in water availability, a process-based eco-hydrology model, NICE (National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology), was applied to two contrasting river basins: the Tuul River, which is characteristic of northern grassland and steppe, and the Galba River, characteristic of the southern Gobi Desert. The authors built a high-resolution data grid representing water use for livestock, urban populations, and mining in the entire basins by combining a global dataset, statistical data, GIS data, observation data, and field surveys to improve the accuracy of the model results. The model simulated the effects of past climatic change and human-induced disturbances such as urbanization and mining on water resources during 1980–2018 in these two river basins. The model results showed a clear difference in the hydrologic cycle between them, suggesting the impact of urbanization and mining on local-regional eco-hydrological degradation. Although drinking by herders’ livestock had some impact on the hydrologic change, the groundwater level in the Tuul River was shown to have been extremely degraded by water use in Ulaanbaatar over the last few decades whereas that in the Galba River has declined markedly as a result of Oyu Tolgoi mining since 2010. Analysis of the relative contribution of environmental factors also helped us to separate the effects of climatic change and human activities on spatio-temporal change in the groundwater level. These results clarified the large impact of water use due to urbanization and mining on groundwater degradation around the water sources, in addition to climatic change. This methodology is powerful for evaluating spatio-temporal variations of water availability in regions with fewer inventory data on urbanization and mining. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climatic Change; Eco-hydrology Model; Groundwater Degradation; Human Activity; Water Availability; Agriculture; Catchments; Grid Computing; Groundwater; Population Statistics; Rivers; Urban Growth; Watersheds; Arid And Semi-arid Regions; Environmental Factors; High Resolution Data; Hydrologic Changes; Relative Contribution; Spatio-temporal Changes; Spatio-temporal Variation; Water Availability; Potable Water; Drinking Water; Environmental Factor; Gis; Grassland; Groundwater Exploration; Hydrological Cycle; River Basin; Spatial Variation; Temporal Variation; Urbanization; Water Resource; Central Province [mongolia]; Gobi Desert; Mongolia; Oyu Tolgoi; South Gobi; Ulaanbaatar","Agriculture; Catchments; Grid computing; Groundwater; Population statistics; Rivers; Urban growth; Watersheds; Arid and semi-arid regions; Environmental factors; High resolution data; Hydrologic changes; Relative contribution; Spatio-temporal changes; Spatio-temporal variation; Water availability; Potable water; drinking water; environmental factor; GIS; grassland; groundwater exploration; hydrological cycle; river basin; spatial variation; temporal variation; urbanization; water resource; Central Province [Mongolia]; Gobi Desert; Mongolia; Oyu Tolgoi; South Gobi; Ulaanbaatar","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by an Open Collaborative Research Grant from the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES).

Prior studies mainly exploit autoregressive models - e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNN) and its many variants - to model the flow time series's temporal pattern. However, existing approaches rely on regular and accurate inflow observations, which either fail to predict multiscale inflow (e.g., an hour, a day, or a month ahead prediction) or ignore the uncertainty of observations due to confounding factors such as snowmelt and precipitation. To address the limitations, we propose a novel inflow forecasting model by incorporating the uncertainty of the observations into the RNN model and the continuous-time dynamics of the latent states with neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). Our method, called FlowODE, explicitly encodes the stochasticity of hidden conditions in addition to the temporal dependencies among inflow observations. Moreover, FlowODE explores a continuum of layers instead of discrete RNNs to model the hidden states' dynamics, allowing us to infer the inflow at any time horizon flexibly. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world datasets collected from two large-scale hydropower dams. The results show that our method consistently outperforms previous inflow forecasting models while providing adaptable predictions and a flexible balance between prediction accuracy and computational cost. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Continuous Time Systems; Decision Support Systems; Flood Control; Hydroelectric Power; Large Dataset; Recurrent Neural Networks; Reservoir Management; Reservoirs (water); Autoregressive Modelling; Flow Time Series; Forecasting Models; Forecasting Reservoir Inflow; Hydro-power Generation; Recurrent Neural Network Model; Snow Melt; Temporal Pattern; Uncertainty; Water Ecology; Forecasting","Continuous time systems; Decision support systems; Flood control; Hydroelectric power; Large dataset; Recurrent neural networks; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Autoregressive modelling; Flow time series; Forecasting models; Forecasting reservoir inflow; Hydro-power generation; Recurrent neural network model; Snow melt; Temporal pattern; Uncertainty; Water ecology; Forecasting","","","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.62072077 and No.61602097).","Aboutalebi, Mahyar, Optimal monthly reservoir operation rules for hydropower generation derived with SVR-NSGAII, Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management - ASCE, 141, 11, (2015); Ahmad, Shahryar Khalique, A generic data-driven technique for forecasting of reservoir inflow: Application for hydropower maximization, Environmental Modelling and Software, 119, pp. 147-165, (2019); Apaydin, Halit, Comparative analysis of recurrent neural network architectures for reservoir inflow forecasting, Water (Switzerland), 12, 5, (2020); Ascher, Uri M., Implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods for time-dependent partial differential equations, Applied Numerical Mathematics, 25, 2-3, pp. 151-167, (1997); Babaei, Mohammad, Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine Models for Inflow Prediction of Dam Reservoir (Case Study: Zayandehroud Dam Reservoir), Water Resources Management, 33, 6, pp. 2203-2218, (2019); Banihabib, Mohammad Ebrahim, Auto-Regressive Neural-Network Models for Long Lead-Time Forecasting of Daily Flow, Water Resources Management, 33, 1, pp. 159-172, (2019); Chang, Fi John, A nonlinear spatio-temporal lumping of radar rainfall for modeling multi-step-ahead inflow forecasts by data-driven techniques, Journal of Hydrology, 535, pp. 256-269, (2016); Chen, Ricky T.Q., Neural ordinary differential equations, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2018-December, pp. 6571-6583, (2018); Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling, (2014); Cuena, J., USE OF SIMULATION MODELS AND HUMAN ADVICE TO BUILD AN EXPERT SYSTEM FOR THE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF RIVER FLOODS., 1, pp. 246-249, (1983)","","Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","","35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2021","","Virtual, Online","176953","","9781713835974","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130097997"

Recently, researchers have started to employ autonomous real-Time systems involving deep learning techniques for this purpose. However, the wide va-riety of heterogeneous diseases affecting crop yield continues to prove itself a mammoth task for farmers and stymies the researchers. The majority of the current state-of-The-Art models utilize datasets like Plant Village, consisting of leaf images taken in a controlled lab environment, which do not serve as accurate representative data of the real-world scenario. Moreover, the effectiveness of state-of-The-Art models like EfficientNetLite, which provided notable improvements in accuracy for similar deep learning applications, remains untested on plant disease datasets. Hence, an exhaustive study on the performance of various state-of-The-Art models with varied training conditions on real-Time datasets like PlantDoc is imperative to further this area of research. In this paper, we have explored state-of-The-Art CNNs like InceptionResNet, EfficientNetLite_0, and VGG-19, under various parameter settings, image augmentations techniques, and loss functions on the real-Time PlantDoc dataset. We have evaluated and presented a comparative analysis of the exhaustive combinations and performances gauged by accuracy, top-5 accuracy, F1 scores, and other inferences drawn from training and testing all these networks on 27 different classes of crop diseases. We infer that EfficientNetLite proved to be a most effective architecture, especially given its relatively smaller size. EfficientNetLite coupled with the focal loss function and Albumentaions augmentation library yielded the best results with an accuracy of 70.71%, mean F1-score as 0.7, and 95.57% top-5 accuracy, on a test set congruent with real-world relevance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Efficientnet; Inception Resnet; Plant Disease Detection; Plantdoc Dataset; Plantvillage Dataset; Vgg; Computer Vision; Crops; Deep Learning; Interactive Computer Systems; Art Model; Disease Detection; Efficientnet; Inception Resnet; Plant Disease; Plant Disease Detection; Plantdoc Dataset; Plantvillage Dataset; State Of The Art; Vgg; Real Time Systems","Computer vision; Crops; Deep learning; Interactive computer systems; ART model; Disease detection; Efficientnet; Inception resnet; Plant disease; Plant disease detection; Plantdoc dataset; Plantvillage dataset; State of the art; VGG; Real time systems","","","","Early Blight of Tomato Vegetable Pathology Factsheets, (2015); Barbedo, Jayme G.A., Plant disease identification from individual lesions and spots using deep learning, Biosystems Engineering, 180, pp. 96-107, (2019); Mohanty, Sharada Prasanna, Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection, Frontiers in Plant Science, 7, September, (2016); Too, Edna Chebet, A comparative study of fine-tuning deep learning models for plant disease identification, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 161, pp. 272-279, (2019); Human and Machine Learning, (2018); Efficientnet Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks, (2019); Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection Arxiv 1708 02002v2 Cs Cv, (2018); A Unified Framework of Surrogate Loss by Refactoring and Interpolation Arxiv 2007 13870v1 Cs Cv, (2020); Plantdoc A Dataset for Visual Plant Disease Detection Arxiv 1911 10317v1 Cs Cv, (2019); Lee, Sue Han, New perspectives on plant disease characterization based on deep learning, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 170, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","4th International Conference on Computing and Communications Technologies, ICCCT 2021","","Chennai","177364","","9781665414470","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126756571"

Moreover, computational capacity in real-world settings may be limited. This work examines how accurate, computationally efficient real-time plant detection can be achieved on the large and varied benchmarking Open Plant Phenotyping Database, by building upon the State-of-the-Art (SoA) Scaled YOLO v4 real-time object detection model. The effect of pre-processing, namely cropping unnecessary information and increasing contrast, is examined and experimentally shown to improve both accuracy and efficiency. Transfer learning is also leveraged for the deployment of Scaled YOLO v4, using pre-trained weights from the MS COCO data set, and shown to lead to a moderate improvement in accuracy. The proposed final model results in approximately 10% higher accuracy than the existing baseline model, on a representative subset of about half of images in the Open Plant Phenotyping Database. Experiments show that plant detection accuracy is improved for most well represented samples, with errors appearing in particularly challenging cases or caused by data imbalance. This shows the proposed method has significant potential for highly accurate and computationally efficient plant detection in real-world environments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Object Detection; Plant Classification; Precision Farming; Transfer Learning; Yolo; Agriculture; Benchmarking; Classification (of Information); Computational Efficiency; Computer Vision; Efficiency; Large Dataset; Object Detection; Computationally Efficient; Plant Classification; Plant Detections; Plant Phenotyping; Precision Agriculture; Precision-farming; Real- Time; Real-world Datasets; Transfer Learning; Yolo; Object Recognition","Agriculture; Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Computational efficiency; Computer vision; Efficiency; Large dataset; Object detection; Computationally efficient; Plant classification; Plant detections; Plant phenotyping; Precision Agriculture; Precision-farming; Real- time; Real-world datasets; Transfer learning; YOLO; Object recognition","","","","Barbedo, Jayme G.A., A review on the main challenges in automatic plant disease identification based on visible range images, Biosystems Engineering, 144, pp. 52-60, (2016); Computer Vision A Versatile Technology in Automation of Agriculture Machinery, (2010); Zwiggelaar, Reyer, A review of spectral properties of plants and their potential use for crop/weed discrimination in row-crops, Crop Protection, 17, 3, pp. 189-206, (1998); Tsaftaris, Sotirios A., Machine Learning for Plant Phenotyping Needs Image Processing, Trends in Plant Science, 21, 12, pp. 989-991, (2016); Lu, Yuzhen, A survey of public datasets for computer vision tasks in precision agriculture, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 178, (2020); Madsen, Simon Leminen, Open plant phenotype database of common weeds in Denmark, Remote Sensing, 12, 8, (2020); Scaled Yolov4 Scaling Cross Stage Partial Network, (2020); Lin, Tsungyi, Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8693 LNCS, PART 5, pp. 740-755, (2014); McKinion, James M., Expert systems for agriculture, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 1, 1, pp. 31-40, (1985); Comment Open Source Appendix on More Results, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for Agriculture and Forestry, MetroAgriFor 2021","","Virtual, Online","175226","","9781665405331","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123398865"

Recent studies (e.g., SVANN, spatial ensemble) targeting this difficult problem either require a known space-partitioning as the input, or can only support very limited number of partitions or classes (e.g., two) due to the decrease in training data size and the complexity of analysis. To address these limitations, we propose a model-agnostic framework to automatically transform a deep learning model into a spatial-heterogeneity-aware architecture, where the learning of arbitrary space partitionings is guided by a learning-engaged generalization of multivariate scan statistic and parameters are shared based on spatial relationships. We also propose a spatial moderator to generalize learned space partitionings to new test regions. Experiment results on real-world datasets show that the spatial transformation and moderation framework can effectively capture flexibly-shaped heterogeneous footprints and substantially improve prediction performances. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Spatial Heterogeneity; Statistics; Crops; Deep Learning; Metadata; Partitions (building); Satellite Imagery; Agricultural Crops; Crop Monitoring; Data Distribution; Decisions Makings; Intrinsic Characteristics; Network Transformation; Space Partitioning; Spatial Data; Spatial Heterogeneity; Decision Making","Crops; Deep learning; Metadata; Partitions (building); Satellite imagery; Agricultural crops; Crop monitoring; Data distribution; Decisions makings; Intrinsic characteristics; Network transformation; Space partitioning; Spatial data; Spatial heterogeneity; Decision making","","","Yiqun Xie is supported in part by NSF awards 2105133 and 2126474, Google’s AI for Social Good Impact Scholars program, and the DRI award at the University of Maryland; Erhu He and Xiaowei Jia are supported in part by USGS award G21AC10207, Pitt Momentum Funds award, and CRC at the University of Pittsburgh; Han Bao and Xun Zhou are supported in part by the ISSSF grant from the University of Iowa, and SAFER-SIM funded by US-DOT award 69A3551747131.","Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring Initiative, (2021); Kraemer, Moritz U.G., The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China, Science, 368, 6490, pp. 493-497, (2020); Atluri, Gowtham, Spatio-temporal data mining: A survey of problems and methods, ACM Computing Surveys, 51, 4, (2019); Shekhar, Shashi, Spatial computing, Communications of the ACM, 59, 1, pp. 72-81, (2016); Krizhevsky, Alex, ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2, pp. 1097-1105, (2012); 1st ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Deep Learning for Spatiotemporal Data Applications and Systems, (2020); Jiang, Zhe, Spatial ensemble learning for heterogeneous geographic data with class ambiguity, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 10, 4, (2019); Brunsdon, Chris F., Some notes on parametric significance tests for geographically weighted regression, Journal of Regional Science, 39, 3, pp. 497-524, (1999); Kratsios, Anastasis, Non-Euclidean universal approximation, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020-December, (2020); ACM Sigspatial, (2021)","Bailey, J.; Miettinen, P.; Koh, Y.S.; Tao, D.; Wu, X.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Google; IEEE Technical Committee on Intelligent Informatics; School of Computer Science - The University of Auckland; Two Sigma; US National Science Foundation (NSF)","21st IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM 2021","","Virtual, Online","176603","15504786","9780769527024; 9781665450997; 0769530192; 0769517544; 9781665423984; 9780769530192; 9780769530185; 0769527019; 9781728183169; 9780769542560","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119165692"

This paper focuses on one such initiative contributing to attaining this goal, namely, the identification or prediction of disease in crops. More specifically the paper examines the automated quantification of the severity of common rust in maize. Previous work has focused on using standard image processing algorithms for this problem. This is the first study, to the knowledge of the authors, employing machine learning techniques to determine the severity of common rust disease in maize. Quantifying the severity of common rust is achieved by counting the number of pustules on maize leaves and determining the surface area of the leaf covered by pustules. In this study a Mask R-CNN is used to determine this. Both the standard image processing algorithms and the Mask R-CNN were evaluated on a real-world dataset created from images of maize leaves grown in a greenhouse. The Mask R-CNN was found to outperform the standard image processing algorithms in terms of counting the number of pustules, calculation of the pustule surface area and the average pustule size. These results were found to be statistically significant at a 5% level of significance. One of the challenges with Mask R-CNN is finding suitable parameter values, which is time consuming. Future work will examine automating parameter tuning for the Mask R-CNN. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Image Processing; Mask R-cnn; Plant Disease Severity Quantification; Food Supply; Machine Learning; Plants (botany); Disease Severity; Food Security; Image Processing Algorithm; Images Processing; Plant Disease; Plant Disease Severity Quantification; Standard Images; Surface Area; Sustainable Agriculture; United Nations; Image Processing","Food supply; Machine learning; Plants (botany); Disease severity; Food security; Image processing algorithm; Images processing; Plant disease; Plant disease severity quantification; Standard images; Surface area; Sustainable agriculture; United Nations; Image processing","","","Acknowledgements.

Current maps of global wetland extent vary in their wetland definition, causing substantial disagreement between and large uncertainty in estimates of wetland methane emissions. To reconcile these differences for large-scale wetland CH4 modeling, we developed the global Wetland Area and Dynamics for Methane Modeling (WAD2M) version 1.0 dataset at a ∼25 km resolution at the Equator (0.25°) at a monthly time step for 2000-2018. WAD2M combines a time series of surface inundation based on active and passive microwave remote sensing at a coarse resolution with six static datasets that discriminate inland waters, agriculture, shoreline, and non-inundated wetlands. We excluded all permanent water bodies (e.g., lakes, ponds, rivers, and reservoirs), coastal wetlands (e.g., mangroves and sea grasses), and rice paddies to only represent spatiotemporal patterns of inundated and non-inundated vegetated wetlands. Globally, WAD2M estimates the long-term maximum wetland area at 13:0×106 km2 (13.0Mkm2), which can be divided into three categories: mean annual minimum of inundated and non-inundated wetlands at 3.5Mkm2, seasonally inundated wetlands at 4.0Mkm2 (mean annual maximum minus mean annual minimum), and intermittently inundated wetlands at 5.5Mkm2 (long-term maximum minus mean annual maximum). WAD2M shows good spatial agreements with independent wetland inventories for major wetland complexes, i.e., the Amazon Basin lowlands and West Siberian lowlands, with Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.54 and 0.70 respectively among multiple wetland products. By evaluating the temporal variation in WAD2M against modeled prognostic inundation (i.e., TOPMODEL) and satellite observations of inundation and soil moisture, we show that it adequately represents interannual variation as well as the effect of El Niño-Southern Oscillation on global wetland extent. This wetland extent dataset will improve estimates of wetland CH4 fluxes for global-scale land surface modeling. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Annual Variation; El Nino-southern Oscillation; Land Surface; Methane; Remote Sensing; Satellite Data; Soil Moisture; Temporal Variation; Time Series Analysis; Wetland; Amazon Basin; Russian Federation; Siberian Lowland","annual variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; land surface; methane; remote sensing; satellite data; soil moisture; temporal variation; time series analysis; wetland; Amazon Basin; Russian Federation; Siberian Lowland","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements.

This article explores the issue through a systematic review of the extant literature on gender and fertiliser use in maize production. The findings show that indeed a gender gap in the use of fertiliser exists. More than a decade after the World Bank identified a gender gap in fertiliser use, there are no systematic national or global data sets comparing fertiliser use by gender. While farm input subsidies can improve women farmer’s access to fertiliser and have a positive effect on agricultural productivity for both men and women farmers, this approach has little effect on reducing the gender gap in agricultural productivity. The challenges associated with gender and fertiliser access and use are complex and there is no silver bullet intervention that can address the problem, particularly in relation to intra-household dynamics and social norms. Thus solving the noted problem, will require a holistic approach rather than “simple” sectoral interventions. Over time, suboptimal fertiliser use depletes soils. Nutrient use efficiencies worsen under soil nutrient mining and degradation, thus economic incentives for fertiliser investments are also eroded in such situations, resulting in a vicious cycle. The development of nutrient use efficient maize seed technologies could be an intermediate step towards closing the gender gap in fertiliser use. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Yield; Gender; Inorganic Fertiliser; Staple Food; Zea Mays","","","","This study is supported by the Seed Production Technology for Africa (STPA) project, which is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (grant number OPP1137722) and the CGIAR Research Program MAIZE).

For single species, terrestrial mammal population densities have shown mixed responses to human pressure, with both increasing and decreasing densities reported in the literature. How the impacts of human activities on mammal populations translates into altered global density patterns remains unclear. Here we aim to disentangle the effect of human impacts on large-scale patterns of mammal population densities using a global dataset of 6729 population density estimates for 468 mammal species (representing 59% and 44% of mammalian orders and families). We fitted a mixed effect model to explain the variation in density based on a 1-degree resolution as a function of the human footprint index (HFI), a global proxy of direct and indirect human disturbances, while accounting for body mass, trophic level and primary productivity (normalized vegetation index; NDVI). We found a significant positive relationship between population density and HFI, where population densities were higher in areas with a higher HFI (e.g. agricultural or suburban areas – no populations were located in very high HFI urban areas) compared to areas with a low HFI (e.g. wilderness areas). We also tested the effect of the individual components of the HFI and still found a consistent positive effect. The relationships remained positive even across populations of the same species, although variability among species was high. Our results indicate shifts in mammal population densities in human modified landscapes, which is due to the combined effect of species filtering, increased resources and a possible reduction in competition and predation. Our study provides further evidence that macroecological patterns are being altered by human activities, where some species will benefit from these activities, while others will be negatively impacted or even extirpated. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abundance; Anthropocene; Demography; Human Footprint; Landscape Fragmentation; Terrestrial Mammal; Anthropogenic Effect; Global Perspective; Human Activity; Macroecology; Mammal; Population Density; Terrestrial Ecosystem; Trophic Level; Mammalia","anthropogenic effect; global perspective; human activity; macroecology; mammal; population density; terrestrial ecosystem; trophic level; Mammalia","","","\u2013 MAT and TM were supported by the Robert Bosch Foundation and MAT was additionally supported by the Goethe International Postdoctoral Programme, People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007\u20132013/ under REA grant agreement no.

All erosion factors and components were produced in GIS grid-based modeling. Therefore, the required data, such as topography, climate, and soil characteristics, were collected from global databases. The estimated annual soil loss values were classified into five classes from slight soil losses (0–3 t ha−1 year−1) at the plain lowland in the northern region to severe soil losses (25–55 t ha−1 year−1) at the hillsides and terraces in the middle part of the study area. The results revealed that about 9.36% of the study area (6743 km2) is under critical erosion-prone zones of high and severe soil losses (over 15 t ha−1 year−1). Ultimately, the relationships between soil loss-prone zones and soil taxonomy order/sub-orders were investigated to prevalence the results in the other alike geo-climatic status. Correlation analysis conveniently confirmed a very strong, significant, and direct relationship (R equal to 0.997) between high/severe soil losses and xerolls in the study area at the 95% confidence level. In the study area, the most soil loss and sedimentation were predicted for xerolls soil sub-order (mollisols) with 5.5 t ha−1 year−1 and 14.69 million t year−1 (over 60% of total sedimentations). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Planning; Erosion Model; Geographical Information System (gis); Soil Losses; Soil Taxonomy; Universal Soil Loss Equation (usle); Agricultural Robots; Erosion; Sediment Transport; Topography; Agricultural Areas; Confidence Levels; Correlation Analysis; Erosion Factors; Global Database; Northern Regions; Soil Characteristics; Universal Soil Loss Equation; Soils; Agricultural Land; Assessment Method; Correlation; Database; Mollisol; Numerical Model; Sedimentation; Taxonomy; Iran; Mashhad; Razavi Khorasan","Agricultural robots; Erosion; Sediment transport; Topography; Agricultural areas; Confidence levels; Correlation analysis; Erosion factors; Global database; Northern regions; Soil characteristics; Universal soil loss equation; Soils; agricultural land; assessment method; correlation; database; Mollisol; numerical model; sedimentation; taxonomy; Iran; Mashhad; Razavi Khorasan","","","","Adinarayana, Jagarlapudi, A rule-based soil erosion model for a hilly catchment, Catena, 37, 3-4, pp. 309-318, (1999); Auerswald, Karl, Use and misuse of the K factor equation in soil erosion modeling: An alternative equation for determining USLE nomograph soil erodibility values, Catena, 118, pp. 220-225, (2014); Baban, Serwan M.J., Modelling soil erosion in tropical environments using remote sensing and geographical information systems, Hydrological Sciences Journal, 46, 2, pp. 191-198, (2001); Bagarello, Vincenzo, Estimating the USLE soil erodibility factor in Sicily, South Italy, Applied Engineering in Agriculture, 28, 2, pp. 199-206, (2012); Bagherzadeh, Ali, Estimation of soil losses by USLE model using GIS at Mashhad plain, Northeast of Iran, Arabian Journal of Geosciences, 7, 1, pp. 211-220, (2014); Bagherzadeh, Ali, Mapping of landslide hazard zonation using GIS at Golestan watershed, northeast of Iran, Arabian Journal of Geosciences, 6, 9, pp. 3377-3388, (2013); Bagherzadeh, Ali, Evaluation of sediment yield and soil loss by the MPSIAC model using GIS at Golestan watershed, northeast of Iran, Arabian Journal of Geosciences, 6, 9, pp. 3349-3362, (2013); Bagherzadeh, Ali, Qualitative Land Suitability Evaluation for Wheat and Barley Crops in Khorasan-Razavi Province, Northeast of Iran, Agricultural Research, 3, 2, pp. 155-164, (2014); KC, Krishna Bahadur, Mapping soil erosion susceptibility using remote sensing and GIS: A case of the Upper Nam Wa Watershed, Nan Province, Thailand, Environmental Geology, 57, 3, pp. 695-705, (2009); Bartsch, Kevin P., Using empirical erosion models and GIS to determine erosion risk at Camp Williams, Utah, Journal of Soil and Water Conservation, 57, 1, pp. 29-37, (2002)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","16112504; 16112490","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090756604"

Good management requires information on the status of harvested species, yet many gaps remain in our understanding of these species and systems, in particular the lack of taxonomic resolution of harvested species. To assess these gaps we compared the occurrence of landed species (freshwater and marine) from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) global fisheries production database to those in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database, some of the largest and most comprehensive global datasets of consumed aquatic species. We also quantified the level of resolution and trends in taxonomic reporting for all landed taxa in the FAO database. Of the 1,695 consumed aquatic species or groups in the FAO database considered in this analysis, a large portion (35%) are missing from both of the other two global datasets, either IUCN or RAM, used to monitor, manage, and protect aquatic resources. Only a small number of all fished taxa reported in FAO data (150 out of 1,695; 9%) have both a stock assessment in RAM and a conservation assessment in IUCN. Furthermore, 40% of wild caught landings are not reported to the species level, limiting our ability to effectively account for the environmental impacts of wild harvest. Landings of invertebrates (44%) and landings in Asia (>75%) accounted for the majority of harvest without species specific information in 2018. Assessing the overlap of species which are both farmed and fished to broadly map possible interactions – which can help or hinder wild populations - we found 296 species, accounting for 12% of total wild landings globally, and 103 countries and territories that have overlap in the species caught in the wild and produced through aquaculture. In all, our work highlights that while fisheries management is improving in many areas there remain key gaps in data resolution that are critical for fisheries assessments and conservation of aquatic systems into the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Uncertainty; Global Oceans; Knowledge Gaps; Overexploited; Seafood; Wild Capture","","","","We thank the National Philanthropic Trust & The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis for financial support.","Alleway, Heidi K., The Ecosystem Services of Marine Aquaculture: Valuing Benefits to People and Nature, BioScience, 69, 1, pp. 59-68, (2019); Ames, Robert T., Evaluation of video technology for monitoring of multispecies longline catches, North American Journal of Fisheries Management, 27, 3, pp. 955-964, (2007); Anderson, Sean C., Rapid global expansion of invertebrate fisheries: Trends, drivers, and ecosystem effects, PLOS ONE, 6, 3, (2011); Ardura Gutierrez, Alba, Applications of DNA barcoding to fish landings: Authentication and diversity assessment, ZooKeys, 365, SPEC.ISSUE, pp. 49-65, (2013); Asche, Frank, Market interactions for aquaculture products, Aquaculture Economics and Management, 5, 5-6, pp. 303-318, (2001); Barrett, Luke T., Impacts of marine and freshwater aquaculture on wildlife: a global meta-analysis, Reviews in Aquaculture, 11, 4, pp. 1022-1044, (2019); Berkes, Fikret, Globalization, roving bandits, and marine resources, Science, 311, 5767, pp. 1557-1558, (2006); Boettiger, Carl, Rfishbase: Exploring, manipulating and visualizing FishBase data from R, Journal of Fish Biology, 81, 6, pp. 2030-2039, (2012); Branch, Trevor A., How do individual transferable quotas affect marine ecosystems?, Fish and Fisheries, 10, 1, pp. 39-57, (2009); Branch, Trevor A., Fishing Impacts on Food Webs: Multiple Working Hypotheses, Fisheries, 40, 8, pp. 373-375, (2015)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","22967745","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098644316"

Here, we assess the potential of a variety of sustainable land management practices that, beyond addressing specific and local issues, assist in tackling Mediterranean Basin-wide land-use challenges. With this work, we aim to highlight those options that simultaneously promote local and regional Basin-wide adaptation. To do that, we developed a novel multi-objective assessment that evaluates the effectiveness of 104 practices adopted within the Mediterranean Basin and documented in the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies global database. Results indicate that agroforestry and green covers in perennial woody crops can promote multiple ecosystem services while addressing climate change adaptation. We further argue that these two practices together with reforestation, assist in regulating the hydrological cycle of the Basin and in maintaining its multifunctional landscape. Lastly, we reflect on potential biophysical and socio-economic barriers and opportunities associated with the implementation of the three practices. Our approach provides a Basin-wide integrated view that facilitates the coordination of sustainable management strategies across the Mediterranean region. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change Adaptation; Desertification; Mediterranean Basin; Sustainable Land Management; Wocat; Database; Environmental Assessment; Hydrological Cycle; Land Management; Management Practice; Rural Area; Sustainability; Sustainable Development; Agroforestry; Article; Climate Change; Comparative Effectiveness; Crop; Desertification; Ecosystem; Land Use; Nonhuman; Reforestation; Southern Europe; Agriculture; Environmental Protection; Human; Mediterranean Sea; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Mediterranean Region","database; environmental assessment; hydrological cycle; land management; management practice; rural area; sustainability; sustainable development; agroforestry; article; climate change; comparative effectiveness; crop; desertification; ecosystem; land use; nonhuman; reforestation; Southern Europe; agriculture; environmental protection; human; Mediterranean Sea; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Mediterranean Region","","","The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers whose comments helped improve this work.

To analyze how this contributes to naturalization success, we combine global databases on economic uses and naturalization success of the world’s seed plants. Here we show that naturalization likelihood is 18 times higher for economic than non-economic plants. Naturalization success is highest for plants grown as animal food or for environmental uses (e.g. ornamentals), and increases with number of uses. Taxa from the Northern Hemisphere are disproportionately over-represented among economic plants, and economic plants from Asia have the greatest naturalization success. In regional naturalized floras, the percentage of economic plants exceeds the global percentage and increases towards the equator. Phylogenetic patterns in the naturalized flora partly result from phylogenetic patterns in the plants we cultivate. Our study illustrates that accounting for the intentional introduction of economic plants is key to unravelling drivers of plant naturalization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cultivation; Economic Analysis; Naturalization; Northern Hemisphere; Ornamental Species; Animal Food; Article; Asia; Flora; Human; Nonhuman; Seed Plant; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Classification; Economics; Environmental Protection; Geography; Introduced Species; Phylogeny; Physiology; Plant; Plant Physiology; Plant Seed; Species Difference; Animalia; Spermatophyta; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Geography; Introduced Species; Phylogeny; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Plants; Seeds; Species Specificity","cultivation; economic analysis; naturalization; Northern Hemisphere; ornamental species; animal food; article; Asia; flora; human; nonhuman; seed plant; agriculture; biodiversity; classification; economics; environmental protection; geography; introduced species; phylogeny; physiology; plant; plant physiology; plant seed; species difference; Animalia; Spermatophyta; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Geography; Introduced Species; Phylogeny; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Plants; Seeds; Species Specificity","","","We thank Vanessa Pasqualetto for extracting the data from the World Economic Plants database.

Although Chile is recognized as one of the most affected countries by climate change, it is also one of the least covered by hydrometeorological measuring instruments. This data scarcity prevents thorough characterization of hydrological basins. To solve this problem, we constructed a decade-long (2000–2011) high-resolution (Formula presented.) monthly gridded precipitation product for the central-southern zone (Formula presented.) covering regions from O’Higgins to Los Ríos. These regions contain most of Chile’s agricultural land, livestock, forestry, and hydroelectric production. The study zone covers a variety of topographies and climates, including eight hydrological basins: Rapel, Mataquito, Maule, Itata, BioBío, Imperial, Toltén, and Valdivia. We develop a dynamic topo-climatic methodology that includes local and global data. We combined a dynamic downscaling and a spatial-temporal multivariate model over different geographical areas that considered high-resolution precipitation fields from model data, in situ stations, and different global precipitation datasets that also understand satellite observations. Results show that most of the precipitation spatial-temporal variability is well-captured by the model in the north and central regions, from O’Higgins to Biobío, with the goodness of fit (Formula presented.) fluctuating around 0.86 and 0.82, respectively. Toward the south, Araucanía and Los Ríos, the goodness of fit (Formula presented.) decreased to values around 0.74 and 0.72, respectively. Both the modified Willmott coefficient (Formula presented.) and the nse indicated a good model skill, with values over 0.8 and 0.7, respectively. Meanwhile, the (Formula presented.), nrmse, and pbias changed between (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.), respectively.

Traditional SLAM approaches infer the metric state of the robot along with a metric map of the environment. While existing algorithms exhibit good results, they are still sensitive to measurement noise, sensors quality, data association and are still computationally expensive. Alternatively, we note that some navigation and mapping missions can be achieved using only qualitative geometric information, an approach known as qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR). In this work we contribute a novel probabilistic qualitative localization and mapping approach, which extends the state of the art by inferring also the qualitative state of the camera poses (localization), as well as incorporating probabilistic connections between views (in time and in space).

However, predicting plausible future global distributions of croplands remains challenging. Here, we show that, in general, existing global data aligned with classical economic theories of expansion explain the current (1992) global extent of cropland reasonably well, but not recent expansion (1992–2015). Deviations from models of cropland extent in 1992 (“frontierness”) can be used to improve global models of recent expansion, most likely as these deviations are a proxy for cropland expansion under frontier conditions where classical economic theories of expansion are less applicable. Frontierness is insensitive to the land cover dataset used and is particularly effective in improving models that include mosaic land cover classes and the largely smallholder-driven frontier expansion occurring in such areas. Our findings have important implications as the frontierness approach offers a straightforward way to improve global land use change models.; Predicting where cropland is likely to expand globally has important implications for climate change and biodiversity. However, doing so is challenging because of a lack of data on key drivers of current expansion in so-called frontier areas (e.g., governance). Here, we show that using deviations from a model of cropland extent in 1992 built on all available data improves models of recent (1992–2015) cropland expansion over and above using the best available existing data.; Cropland area is increasing globally to satisfy the growing population and consumption rates. Cropland expansion often comes at the expense of forests, which are critical for conserving biodiversity and mitigating against climate change. Therefore, it is essential to know where cropland expansion is likely to occur in the future in order to design policies that prevent expansion in areas that are most likely to conflict with forest conservation. However, predicting where expansion is most likely is difficult as few data are available on key predictors related to governance. Here, we devise a novel, two-stage method for predicting expansion of cropland. First, available data are used to model where cropland existed in 1992. We then use maps that show where the first model fails to explain cropland in 1992 to help predict expansion of cropland between 1992 and 2015. We show that this approach is an improvement over simply using existing data to predict recent expansion of cropland. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Climate Change; Cropland Expansion; Deforestation; Frontier Dynamics; Integrated Assessment Models; Land Use Change; Positive Deviance Analysis; Sustainability; Agricultural Land; Assessment Method; Climate Change; Conservation; Deforestation; Economic Theory; Expansion; Land Use Change; Sustainability","agricultural land; assessment method; climate change; conservation; deforestation; economic theory; expansion; land use change; sustainability","","","Funding text 1: F.E.

In this work, we explain a new approach for cocoa beans with pulp classification, in order to aid in the process of removing cocoa beans pulp to efficiently estimate the quality of these beans. Our approach used morphological operations, k-means clustering, a bag of visual words as a feature extractor, and finally a support vector machine classifier.

Using a global dataset composed of 5242 observations encompassing 48 agricultural pest species and 26 crop species, we tested the role of pest traits (exotic status, host breadth and habitat breadth) and environmental context (crop type, range in landscape gradient and climate) in modifying the pest response to increasing semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape. For natives, increasing semi-natural habitats decreased the abundance of pests that exploit only crop habitats or that are highly polyphagous. On the contrary, populations of exotic pests increased with an increasing cover of semi-natural habitats. These effects might be related to changes in host plants and other resources across the landscapes and/or to modified top-down control by natural enemies. The range of the landscape gradient explored and climate did not affect pests, while crop type modified the response of pests to landscape composition. Although species traits and environmental context helped in explaining some of the variability in pest response to landscape composition, the observed large interspecific differences suggest that a portfolio of strategies must be considered and implemented for the effective control of rapidly changing communities of crop pests in agroecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alien Species; Biological Invasions; Conservation Biocontrol; Global Change; Invasive Insects; Landscape Simplification; Agricultural Ecosystem; Biocontrol Agent; Biological Invasion; Climate Effect; Crop Pest; Global Change; Host Plant; Insect; Introduced Species; Landscape Ecology; Pest Control; Plant-insect Interaction; Hexapoda; Agriculture; Animal; Biological Pest Control; Crop; Ecosystem; Agriculture; Animals; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Insecta; Pest Control, Biological","agricultural ecosystem; biocontrol agent; biological invasion; climate effect; crop pest; global change; host plant; insect; introduced species; landscape ecology; pest control; plant-insect interaction; Hexapoda; agriculture; animal; biological pest control; crop; ecosystem; Agriculture; Animals; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Insecta; Pest Control, Biological","","","","Pimentel, David P., Environmental and economic costs of the application of pesticides primarily in the United States, 3, pp. 47-71, (2014); Nicolopoulou-Stamati, Polyxeni, Chemical Pesticides and Human Health: The Urgent Need for a New Concept in Agriculture, Frontiers in Public Health, 4, (2016); Bianchi, Felix J.J.A., Sustainable pest regulation in agricultural landscapes: A review on landscape composition, biodiversity and natural pest control, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273, 1595, pp. 1715-1727, (2006); Dainese, Matteo, A global synthesis reveals biodiversity-mediated benefits for crop production, Science Advances, 5, 10, (2019); Tscharntke, Teja, Landscape perspectives on agricultural intensification and biodiversity - Ecosystem service management, Ecology Letters, 8, 8, pp. 857-874, (2005); Chaplin-Kramer, Rebecca E., A meta-analysis of crop pest and natural enemy response to landscape complexity, Ecology Letters, 14, 9, pp. 922-932, (2011); Martin, Emily A., The interplay of landscape composition and configuration: new pathways to manage functional biodiversity and agroecosystem services across Europe, Ecology Letters, 22, 7, pp. 1083-1094, (2019); Veres, Andrea, Does landscape composition affect pest abundance and their control by natural enemies?

KDE allows direct estimation of the bivariate cumulative density function which can be used to extract the marginal distributions with minimal subjectivity. The approach provided excellent fits to bivariate relationships between the standardized soil moisture index (SSMI) computed at three-and six-month accumulations and standardized measures of precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and atmospheric water deficit (AWD = P − PET) at 187 stations in the High Plains region of the US overlying the Ogallala Aquifer. The likelihood of an agricultural drought given a precipitation deficit could be as high as 40–65% within the study area during summer months and between 20–55% during winter months. The relationship between agricultural drought risks and precipitation deficits is strongest in the agriculturally intensive central portions of the study area. The conditional risks of agricultural droughts given unfavorable PET conditions are higher in the eastern humid portions than the western arid portions. Unfavorable PET had a higher impact on the six-month standardized soil moisture index (SSMI6) but was also seen to influence three-month SSMI (SSMI3). Dry states as defined by AWD produced higher risks than either P or PET, suggesting that both of these variables influence agricultural droughts. Agricultural drought risks under favorable conditions of AWD were much lower than when AWD was unfavorable. The agricultural drought risks were higher during the winter when AWD was favorable and point to the role of soil characteristics on agricultural droughts. The information provides a drought atlas for an agriculturally important region in the US and, as such, is of practical use to decision makers. The methodology developed here is also generic and can be extended to other regions with considerable ease as the global datasets required are readily available. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Droughts; Bivariate Joint Distribution; High Plains Aquifer; Meteorology; Ogallala Aquifer; Stochastic Risk Assessment; Water Resources Management; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Aquifers; Drought; Soil Moisture; Statistics; Stochastic Systems; Cumulative Density Functions; Favorable Conditions; Kernel Density Estimation; Marginal Distribution; Meteorological Condition; Potential Evapotranspiration; Precipitation Deficits; Stochastic Framework; Risk Perception; Climate Conditions; Climate Effect; Drought; Estimation Method; Potential Evapotranspiration; Soil Moisture; Stochasticity; Transpiration; Water Storage; Great Plains; Ogallala Aquifer; United States","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Aquifers; Drought; Soil moisture; Statistics; Stochastic systems; Cumulative density functions; Favorable conditions; Kernel Density Estimation; Marginal distribution; Meteorological condition; Potential evapotranspiration; Precipitation deficits; Stochastic framework; Risk perception; climate conditions; climate effect; drought; estimation method; potential evapotranspiration; soil moisture; stochasticity; transpiration; water storage; Great Plains; Ogallala Aquifer; United States","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by The Ogallala Aquifer Program USDA-ARS, grant number 58-3090-9-006 and the APC was funded by the same source.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by The Ogallala Aquifer Program USDA-ARS, grant number 58-3090-9-006 and the APC was funded by the same source.

We describe a connectivity conservation planning framework that draws on recent advances in the fields of surveying, modelling, and optimizing removal of crossings that block aquatic organism passage. We demonstrate this framework with a case study involving 1200 crossings surveyed in Florida, USA in which barrier severity was quantified on a continuous scale from 0 (complete barrier) to 1 (no barrier). Using field surveys, we built a boosted regression tree (BRT) model that linked barrier severity to 44 landscape variables representing natural (e.g., stream size) and anthropogenic (e.g., land use) stream conditions. We used a recently developed optimization routine to conduct two scenarios, including (1) surveyed crossings only and (2) surveyed crossings plus crossings modelled at 5545 unsurveyed locations. The BRT model explained 54% of variation in barrier severity scores and showed that the most severe barriers occurred on small, high-elevation streams draining urban and agricultural catchments. Estimates of connectivity gains following remediation were 5.3-times lower when unsurveyed locations were included in the optimization, suggesting inclusion of unsurveyed sites is critical for conservation planning. Results from this framework can be used over short (e.g., planning immediate barrier mitigation) and long (e.g., planning future field surveys) time horizons to benefit aquatic connectivity conservation. The survey protocol and modelling methods used here, combined with global datasets on stream conditions, can be applied to benefit connectivity planning in other regions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Catchment; Anthropogenic Effect; Aquatic Ecosystem; Connectivity; Conservation Planning; Field Survey; Habitat Fragmentation; Integrated Approach; Land Use Change; Florida [united States]; United States","agricultural catchment; anthropogenic effect; aquatic ecosystem; connectivity; conservation planning; field survey; habitat fragmentation; integrated approach; land use change; Florida [United States]; United States","","","This project was funded through a grant agreement between the Southeast Aquatic Resources Partnership (SARP) and Tennessee Technological University (TTU) and Texas A&M University (TAMU), which was all made possible through a Florida State Wildlife Grant Agreement with SARP.

Existing global datasets associated with cropland are limited by insufficient spatial resolution to properly represent areas with small parcel size distributions, and their less-than-ideal accuracies hamper application at regional and local scales. Diverse very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite systems are now available, offering sub-meter to five-meter resolution (e.g. Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2, and ZiYuan-3), and hence enabling explicit extraction of cropland areas from heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes. This study presented a generalized methodology for operational cropland mapping at very high resolution using a deep convolutional neural network to automatically learn the robust and discriminative features. Specifically, we slightly modified the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) and combined deep long-range features with shadow local features to provide predictions with high level of detail. We demonstrated the modified PSPNet (MPSPNet) over four province-wide study areas (Heilongjiang, Hebei, Zhejiang and Guangdong) with diverse agrosystems across China from north to south using multi-source very high spatial resolution satellite images (mainly Gaofen-1 supplemented with Gaofen-2 and ZiYuan-3), with the overall accuracies ranging from 89.99% to 92.31%. Moreover, we compared MPSPNet with other CNN models and investigated the its behavior by visualizing the learned features on different layers, indicating that combining low and high level features for final classification was an efficient and accurate strategy for cropland mapping because the former capture edge information related to object boundaries and the latter could learn long-range spatial dependencies that helped recognize croplands. The temporal transfer and spatial transfer assessments from the respects of qualitative and quantitative corroborated the robust generalizability of the proposed method. And the contrast to the traditional object-based classification method also demonstrated the advantages and strong generalization capabilities of MPSPNet in extracting cropland using VHSR remote sensed images. We compared our results with the current cropland maps generated from FROM-GLC10, which further verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach for large-scale cropland mapping at very high resolution. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Convolutional Neural Networks; Fusion Of Low-level And High-level Features; Generalization; Large-scale Cropland Mapping; Very High Spatial Resolution; Agricultural Robots; Classification (of Information); Convolution; Deep Neural Networks; Food Supply; Image Resolution; Mapping; Remote Sensing; Agriculture Monitoring; Discriminative Features; Fragmented Landscapes; Generalization Capability; Object-based Classifications; Parcel Size Distribution; Spatial Dependencies; Very High Spatial Resolutions; Convolutional Neural Networks; Agricultural Land; Artificial Neural Network; Food Security; Land Cover; Satellite Altimetry; Satellite Imagery; Satellite Sensor; Spatial Resolution; China; Guangdong; Hebei; Heilongjiang; Zhejiang","Agricultural robots; Classification (of information); Convolution; Deep neural networks; Food supply; Image resolution; Mapping; Remote sensing; Agriculture monitoring; Discriminative features; Fragmented landscapes; Generalization capability; Object-based classifications; Parcel size distribution; Spatial dependencies; Very high spatial resolutions; Convolutional neural networks; agricultural land; artificial neural network; food security; land cover; satellite altimetry; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; spatial resolution; China; Guangdong; Hebei; Heilongjiang; Zhejiang","","","This work was supported by the National High Resolution Earth Observation System (The Civil Part) Technology Projects of China under Grant No. 11-Y20A16-9001-17/18 and the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No. 2018YFC1504603 .","Abou El-Magd, Islam Abou, Improvements in land use mapping for irrigated agriculture from satellite sensor data using a multi-stage maximum likelihood classification, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 24, 21, pp. 4197-4206, (2003); Bartholomé, Etienne, GLC2000: A new approach to global land cover mapping from earth observation data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 26, 9, pp. 1959-1977, (2005); Biradar, C.

Accurate yield estimation is particularly useful for yield mapping and crop diversification planning. In this article, available soil profile data across Sri Lanka were harmonised and compared with the data from two global soil databases (Soilgrids and Openlandmap). Their impact on simulated crop (rice) yield was studied using a pre-calibrated Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) as an exemplar model. To identify the most sensitive soil parameters, a global sensitivity analysis was performed for all parameters across three datasets. Different soil parameters in both global datasets showed significantly (p < 0.05) lower and higher values than observed values. However, simulated rice yields using global data were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than from observed soil. Due to the relatively lower sensitivity to the yield, all parameters except soil texture and bulk density can still be supplied from global databases when observed data are not available. To facilitate the wider application of digital soil data for yield simulations, particularly for neglected and underutilised crops, nation-wide soil maps for 9 parameters up to 100 cm depth were generated and made available online. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Apsim; Openlandmap; Shapley's Effects; Soil Data Quality; Soilgrids; Sricansol; Accuracy Assessment; Agricultural Modeling; Calibration; Crop Yield; Database; Simulation; Soil Analysis; Soil Profile","accuracy assessment; agricultural modeling; calibration; crop yield; database; simulation; soil analysis; soil profile","","","","Karunaratne, Asha S., Modelling Bambara groundnut yield in Southern Africa: Towards a climate-resilient future, Climate Research, 65, pp. 193-203, (2015); Holzworth, Dean P., APSIM - Evolution towards a new generation of agricultural systems simulation, Environmental Modelling and Software, 62, pp. 327-350, (2014); Sci Res Essays, (2017); Modelling Nutrient Dynamics and Yield of Finger Millet Eleusine Coracana in Semi Arid Eastern Kenya Using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator Model Apsim, (2015); Li, Xin, Computer Simulation in Plant Breeding, Advances in Agronomy, 116, pp. 219-264, (2012); Jahanshiri, E., A land evaluation framework for agricultural diversification, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 8, (2020); Mabhaudhi, Tafadzwanashe, Parameterisation and evaluation of the FAO-AquaCrop model for a South African taro (Colocasia esculenta L.

However, it is difficult to accurately estimate actual evapotranspiration (AET) in areas with high spatial heterogeneity along with very little ancillary data available. The presence of spatial heterogeneity is observed over India and being a country, whose economy largely depends on agriculture, estimation of AET is crucial for efficient water management. This study proposed a new framework to evaluate AET at a fine spatial scale suitable for such heterogeneous and data-sparse environments, with spatial and temporal validation using global datasets. Landsat 8 data were used to estimate AET for eight cloud-free days of 2014 over the Malaprabha River Basin in India using the modified surface energy balance algorithm for land (M-SEBAL) and two-source energy balance (TSEB) models. These two AET estimates were compared with Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) AET for spatial and temporal validation respectively. M-SEBAL outperformed TSEB in capturing the magnitude and spatial variability of AET (e.g., spatial correlation between M-SEBAL and MODIS AET was 0.56 and 0.45 for day of year (DOYs) 040 and 136, respectively, whereas for the same DOYs the correlation between TSEB and MODIS AET was 0.16 and 0.36).

We present datasets of cropland extent and agricultural production in a two-paper series of a cultivated planet in 2010. In the first part, we propose a new Self-adapting Statistics Allocation Model (SASAM) to develop the global map of cropland distribution. SASAM is based on the fusion of multiple existing cropland maps and multilevel statistics of the cropland area, which is independent of training samples. First, cropland area statistics are used to rank the input cropland maps, and then a scoring table is built to indicate the agreement among the input datasets. Secondly, statistics are allocated adaptively to the pixels with higher agreement scores until the cumulative cropland area is close to the statistics. The multilevel allocation results are then integrated to obtain the extent of cropland. We applied SASAM to produce a global cropland synergy map with a 500 m spatial resolution for circa 2010. The accuracy assessments show that the synergy map has higher accuracy than the input datasets and better consistency with the cropland statistics. The synergy cropland map is available via an open-data repository (<a hrefCombining double low line""https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ZWSFAA"">https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ZWSFAA</a>; Lu et al., 2020). This new cropland map has been used as an essential input to the Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM) for producing the global dataset of agricultural production for circa 2010, which is described in the second part of the two-paper series. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Financial support.

At the same time, environmental and social equity differences in the region are pronounced, and this inequality is reflected in the production of traditional Mediterranean crops, such as grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), a permanent wood crop, well adapted to the lack of water and recurrent drought in the region, and that has a role in the mitigation role of agriculture in arid environments. Increasing the ability to adapt to adverse impacts of climate change is an important task for Mediterranean agriculture. The indicators selected are widely used by practitioners in this grapevine production sector, linking science to the tools used by stakeholders and therefore encouraging action and innovation among all stakeholders. The novelty of the study is: the definition of adaptation needs based on a combination of indicators of production quantity and quality with a consistent set of climate scenarios; the evaluation of probabilistic changes with special emphasis on drought in a region that has very large climate variability; the definition of adaptation needs based on a consistent set of scenarios in an over 2 million km2; and the evaluation of potential adaptation choices that may contribute to real-time policy analysis and development as national and international policies and agreements in the grapevine production sector. The climate changes scenarios are derived from global datasets. Adaptation efforts are estimated proportionally to the change of the climatic indices and are categorized into low, medium, or high, as a function of the excepted changes in climatic indices. The study emphasizes that non-informed adaptation limits future choices in areas severely impacted. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation; Climate Change; Drought; Vineyards; Adaptation; Agricultural Trade; Climate Change; Drought; Equity; Innovation; Policy Analysis; Stakeholder; Viticulture; North Africa; Southern Europe; Vitis; Vitis Vinifera","adaptation; agricultural trade; climate change; drought; equity; innovation; policy analysis; stakeholder; viticulture; North Africa; Southern Europe; Vitis; Vitis vinifera","","","We acknowledge the financial support by The European Commission, iSQAPPER project (Grant number 635750) ( http://www.isqaper-project.eu/ ) (AI, LG), The Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, ADAPTA project (Grant No. RP170433021), (AI, LG), and The Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Special Program for Young Scientists (Grant No. VJIDOCUPM19DSS) (“Programa Propio de I + D + I de la Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.

Few Earth system models represent agricultural management practices due to the complexity of the interactions between human decisions and biological processes on global scales. We describe the new capabilities of representing crop distributions and management in the Community Land Model (CLM) Version 5, which includes time-varying spatial distributions of major crop types and their management through fertilization and irrigation, and temperature-based phenological triggers. Including active crop management increases peak growing season gross primary productivity (GPP), increases the amplitude of Northern Hemisphere net ecosystem exchange, and changes seasonal and annual patterns of latent and sensible heat fluxes. The CLM5 crop model simulates the global observed historical trend of crop yields with relative fidelity from 1850 to 1990. Cropland expansion was important for increasing crop production, especially during the first century of the simulations, while fertilization and irrigation were important for increasing yields from 1950 onward. From 1990 to present day, observed crop production continued to increase while CLM5 production levels off, likely because intensification practices are not represented in the model. Specifically, CLM does not currently include increasing planting density, crop breeding and genetic modification, representations of tillage, or other management practices that may also affect crop-climate and crop-carbon cycle interactions and alter trends in yields. These results highlight the importance of including crop management in Earth system models, particularly as global data sets for parameterization and evaluation become more readily available. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Management; Community Land Model; Earth System Modeling; Global Crop Model; Agricultural Management; Biological Processes; Crop Production; Decision Making; Fertilizer Application; Food Production; Growing Season; Irrigation System; Northern Hemisphere; Parameterization; Software; Tillage","agricultural management; biological processes; crop production; decision making; fertilizer application; food production; growing season; irrigation system; Northern Hemisphere; parameterization; software; tillage","","","Funding text 1: The CESM project is supported primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Pollinators are essential for the reproduction of wild and cultivated plant species. Protected areas contribute to pollinator conservation by providing key nesting and foraging habitats. We estimate how much of the pantropical pollination service is currently within terrestrial protected areas. We used publicly available global datasets to generate variables known to predict pollinator abundance and have built a pantropical spatially explicit model of the pollination service. Our results suggest that 80% of tropical protected areas contribute to crop pollination. Protected areas (PAs) that currently do not contribute to crop pollination may contribute in the future as agriculturalisation continues and they begin to neighbour croplands. The remaining PAs provide habitat for pollinators of wild plants, alongside many other ecosystem services. Small-sized PAs provide higher pollination service per unit area than large ones due to their greater proximity to crops in general and their greater perimeter per unit area. These small PAs also tend to be under greater anthropogenic pressure than large-sized tropical PAs. We suggest the role of pollination services to croplands from PAs be considered alongside other ecosystem services in PA management decisions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Protected Areas; Regulating Ecosystem Service; Tropical Forest","","","","Claudia Gutiérrez-Arellano thanks the National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico for the doctoral studies grant (407586/217401), from which this manuscript was produced.

To this end, the Interaction between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere (ISBA-A-gs) is evaluated at a complex open olive orchard and, for the purposes of comparison, on a winter wheat field taken as an example of a homogeneous canopy. The initial version of ISBA-A-gs, based on a composite energy budget (hereafter ISBA-1P for one patch), is compared to the new multiple energy balance (MEB) version of ISBA that represents a double source arising from the vegetation located above the soil layer. In addition, a patch representation corresponding to two adjacent, uncoupled source schemes (hereafter ISBA-2P for two patches) is also considered for the olive orchard. Continuous observations of evapotranspiration (ET), with an eddy covariance system and plant transpiration (Tr) with sap flow and isotopic methods were used to evaluate the three representations. A preliminary sensitivity analyses showed a strong sensitivity to the parameters related to turbulence in the canopy introduced in the new ISBA-MEB version. For wheat, the ability of the single-and dual-source configuration to reproduce the composite soil-vegetation heat fluxes was very similar; the root mean square error (RMSE) differences between ISBA-1P, ISBA-2P and ISBA-MEB did not exceed 10Wm2 for the latent heat flux. These results showed that a composite energy balance in homogeneous covers is sufficient to reproduce the total convective fluxes. The two configurations are also fairly close to the isotopic observations of transpiration in spite of a light underestimation (overestimation) of ISBA. 1P (ISBA-MEB). At the olive orchard, contrasting results are obtained. The dual-source configurations, including both the uncoupled (ISBA-2P) and the coupled (ISBA-MEB) representations, outperformed the single-source version (ISBA-1P), with slightly better results for ISBA-MEB in predicting both total heat fluxes and evapotranspiration partition. Concerning plant transpiration in particular, the coupled approach ISBA-MEB provides better results than ISBA-1P and, to a lesser extent, ISBA-2P with RMSEs of 1.60, 0.90, and 0.70mmd1 and R2 of 0.43, 0.69, and 0.70 for ISBA-1P, ISBA-2P and ISBA-MEB, respectively. In addition, it is shown that the acceptable predictions of composite convective fluxes by ISBA-2P for the olive orchard are obtained for the wrong reasons as neither of the two patches is in agreement with the observations because of a bad spatial distribution of the roots and a lack of incoming radiation screening for the bare soil patch. This work shows that composite convection fluxes predicted by the SURFace EXternalisée (SURFEX) platform and the partition of evapotranspiration in a highly transient regime due to irrigation is improved for moderately open tree canopies by the new coupled dualsource ISBA-MEB model. It also points out the need for further local-scale evaluations on different crops of various geometry (more open rainfed agriculture or a denser, intensive olive orchard) to provide adequate parameterisation to global database, such as ECOCLIMAP-II, in the view of a global application of the ISBA-MEB model. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Robots; Budget Control; Crops; Energy Balance; Forecasting; Forestry; Heat Flux; Irrigation; Isotopes; Mean Square Error; Orchards; Sensitivity Analysis; Soils; Transpiration; Vegetation; Continuous Observation; Eddy Covariance Systems; Land Surface Modeling; Mediterranean Region; Plant Transpiration; Rain Fed Agriculture; Root Mean Square Errors; Soil-vegetation-atmosphere Transfer Models; Evapotranspiration; Crop Plant; Energy Balance; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation System; Land Surface; Model; Semiarid Region; Marrakech [(prv) Marrakech-safi]; Marrakech-safi; Mediterranean Region; Morocco; Triticum Aestivum","Agricultural robots; Budget control; Crops; Energy balance; Forecasting; Forestry; Heat flux; Irrigation; Isotopes; Mean square error; Orchards; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Transpiration; Vegetation; Continuous observation; Eddy covariance systems; Land surface modeling; Mediterranean region; Plant transpiration; Rain fed agriculture; Root mean square errors; Soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer models; Evapotranspiration; crop plant; energy balance; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; land surface; model; semiarid region; Marrakech [(PRV) Marrakech-Safi]; Marrakech-Safi; Mediterranean Region; Morocco; Triticum aestivum","","","","Aouade, Ghizlane, Combining stable isotopes, Eddy Covariance system and meteorological measurements for partitioning evapotranspiration, of winter wheat, into soil evaporation and plant transpiration in a semi-arid region, Agricultural Water Management, 177, pp. 181-192, (2016); Bastidas, Luis A., Sensitivity analysis of a land surface scheme using multicriteria methods, Journal of Geophysical Research, 104, D16, pp. 19481-19490, (1999); B́eziat, Pierre, Evaluation of a simple approach for crop evapotranspiration partitioning and analysis of the water budget distribution for several crop species, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 177, pp. 46-56, (2013); Blyth, Eleanor M., Application of aggregation models to surface heat flux from the Sahelian tiger bush, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 72, 3-4, pp. 213-235, (1995); Blyth, Eleanor M., A coupled dual source GCM SVAT, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 3, 1, pp. 71-84, (1999); Boone, Aaron Anthony, Inclusion of a third soil layer in a land surface scheme using the force-restore method, Journal of Applied Meteorology, 38, 11, pp. 1611-1630, (1999); Boone, Aaron Anthony, The AMMA land surface model intercomparison project (ALMIP), Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 90, 12, pp. 1865-1880, (2009); Boone, Aaron Anthony, The interactions between soil-biosphere-atmosphere land surface model with a multi-energy balance (ISBA-MEB) option in SURFEXv8-Part 1: Model description, Geoscientific Model Development, 10, 2, pp. 843-872, (2017); Boulet, Gilles, Mosaic versus dual source approaches for modelling the surface energy balance of a semi-arid land, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 3, 2, pp. 247-258, (1999); Boulet, Gilles, Monitoring water stress using time series of observed to unstressed surface temperature difference, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 146, 3-4, pp. 159-172, (2007)","","Copernicus GmbH info@copernicus.org","","","","","","10275606; 16077938","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092089112"

It quantifies the effect of change from annual to perennial crops and the subsequent temporal changes in SOC stocks during the perennial crop cycle. It also presents an empirical model to estimate changes in the SOC content under crops as a function of time, land use, and site characteristics. We used a harmonized global dataset containing paired-comparison empirical values of SOC and different types of perennial crops (perennial grasses, palms, and woody plants) with different end uses: bioenergy, food, other bio-products, and short rotation coppice. Salient outcomes include: a 20-year period encompassing a change from annual to perennial crops led to an average 20% increase in SOC at 0–30 cm (6.0 ± 4.6 Mg/ha gain) and a total 10% increase over the 0–100 cm soil profile (5.7 ± 10.9 Mg/ha). A change from natural pasture to perennial crop decreased SOC stocks by 1% over 0–30 cm (−2.5 ± 4.2 Mg/ha) and 10% over 0–100 cm (−13.6 ± 8.9 Mg/ha). The effect of a land use change from forest to perennial crops did not show significant impacts, probably due to the limited number of plots; but the data indicated that while a 2% increase in SOC was observed at 0–30 cm (16.81 ± 55.1 Mg/ha), a decrease in 24% was observed at 30–100 cm (−40.1 ± 16.8 Mg/ha). Perennial crops generally accumulate SOC through time, especially woody crops; and temperature was the main driver explaining differences in SOC dynamics, followed by crop age, soil bulk density, clay content, and depth. We present empirical evidence showing that the FAO perennialization strategy is reasonable, underscoring the role of perennial crops as a useful component of climate change mitigation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Arable Crops; Carbon Balance; Emission Factors; Fruit Crops; Land Use Change; Meta-analysis; Woody Crops; Carbon; Carbon; Soil; Crop Plant; Data Set; Empirical Analysis; Land Use Change; Organic Carbon; Perennial Plant; Soil Organic Matter; Poaceae; Carbon; Agriculture; Carbon Sequestration; Crop; Soil; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Crops, Agricultural; Soil","crop plant; data set; empirical analysis; land use change; organic carbon; perennial plant; soil organic matter; Poaceae; carbon; agriculture; carbon sequestration; crop; soil; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Crops, Agricultural; Soil","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon; Soil","Funding text 1: This study was initially funded by the NERC project (NE/N017854/1).

Millions of hectares of land have changed hands for agriculture-driven development over the past decade, and their implementation generates substantial risk of land degradation. This paper investigates land transaction patterns and evaluate their potential socio-environmental impacts in Cambodia, Ethiopia, Liberia, and Peru. We undertake a novel spatially explicit approach to quantify land transactions and conduct scenario-based analyses to explore their implementation consequences on people, land, and carbon emission. Our results demonstrate that existing global datasets on land transactions substantially underestimate their incidence but can either exaggerate or underreport transacted areas. Although confirming that land transactions are more likely to occur in sparsely populated, poorer, and more forested areas, our scenario-based analyses reveal that if fully implemented for agricultural development, land transactions in the four countries will affect more than one million people, yield over 2 Gt of carbon emissions, and disrupt vast swathes of forests. Our findings refute the 'empty land' discourse in government policy and highlight the consequences of land degradation that can occur at an unexpected scale in the 'global land rush.' Future policymaking needs to anticipate the risk of land degradation in terms of deforestation and carbon emission while pursuing agriculture-driven development through land transactions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Emission; Deforestation; Degradation; Development; Land Transactions; Spatial Patterns; Carbon; Deforestation; Degradation; Public Policy; Agricultural Development; Carbon Emissions; Development; Environmental Outcome; Scenario-based Analysis; Spatial Patterns; Spatially Explicit; Transaction Patterns; Environmental Impact; Carbon Emission; Deforestation; Land Degradation; Land Use Conflict; Land Use Planning; Policy Making; Cambodia; Ethiopia; Liberia [west Africa]; Peru","Carbon; Deforestation; Degradation; Public policy; Agricultural development; Carbon emissions; development; Environmental outcome; Scenario-based analysis; Spatial patterns; Spatially explicit; Transaction patterns; Environmental impact; carbon emission; deforestation; land degradation; land use conflict; land use planning; policy making; Cambodia; Ethiopia; Liberia [West Africa]; Peru","","","This research is funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.","Adnan, Shapan, Land grabs and primitive accumulation in deltaic Bangladesh: Interactions between neoliberal globalization, state interventions, power relations and peasant resistance, Journal of Peasant Studies, 40, 1, pp. 87-128, (2013); Ali, Daniel Ayalew, Does large farm establishment create benefits for neighboring smallholders?

Cropping intensity and sowing month are two essential parameters for analyzing the food-water-climate tradeoff as food sustainability indicators. This study presents a global-scale analysis of cropping intensity and sowing month from 2000 to 2015, divided into three groups of years. The study methodology integrates the satellite-derived normalized vegetation index (NDVI) of 16-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and daily land-surface-water coverage (LSWC) data obtained from The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E/2) in 1-km aggregate pixel resolution. A fast Fourier transform was applied to normalize the MODIS NDVI time-series data. By using advanced methods with intensive optic and microwave time-series data, this study set out to anticipate potential dynamic changes in global cropland activity over 15 years representing the Millennium Development Goal period. These products are the first global datasets that provide information on crop activities in 15-year data derived from optic and microwave satellite data. The results show that in 2000-2005, the total global double-crop intensity was 7.1 million km2, which increased to 8.3 million km2 in 2006-2010, and then to approximately 8.6 million km2 in 2011-2015. In the same periods, global triple-crop agriculture showed a rapid positive growth from 0.73 to 1.12 and then 1.28 million km2, respectively. The results show that Asia dominated doubleand triple-crop growth, while showcasing the expansion of single-cropping area in Africa. The finer spatial resolution, combined with a long-term global analysis, means that this methodology has the potential to be applied in several sustainability studies, from global-to local-level perspectives. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amsr-e/2 Lswc; Global Cropping Intensity; Land Surface Phenology; Long-term Sowing Month; Modis Ndvi; Amsr-e; Farming System; Food Production; Food Security; Future Prospect; Image Analysis; Integrated Approach; Microwave Imagery; Modis; Ndvi; Optical Method; Pixel; Satellite Imagery; Sowing Date; Sustainable Development; Africa; Asia","AMSR-E; farming system; food production; food security; future prospect; image analysis; integrated approach; microwave imagery; MODIS; NDVI; optical method; pixel; satellite imagery; sowing date; sustainable development; Africa; Asia","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This project was funded by Research, Community Service and Innovation Program provided by Institut Teknologi Bandung, Kurita Asia Research Grant (19Pid017) provided by Kurita Water and Environment Foundation, and MIRA program of the Ministry of Research and Higher Education of Indonesia.; Funding text 2: This project was funded by Research, Community Service and Innovation Program provided by Institut Teknologi Bandung, Kurita Asia Research Grant (19Pid017) provided by Kurita Water and Environment Foundation, and MIRA program of the Ministry of Research and Higher Education of Indonesia.

The proposed method applies a linear spectral mixing model (LSMM) to PROBA-V time series images to derive vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images for regional analysis. We used S10-TOC (10 days synthesis, 1 km spatial resolution, and top-of-canopy) products for Brazil and S5-TOC (five days synthesis, 100 m spatial resolution, and top-of-canopy) products for Mato Grosso State (Brazilian Legal Amazon). Using the time series of the vegetation fraction images of the whole year (2015 in this case), only one mosaic composed with maximum values of vegetation fraction was generated, allowing detecting and mapping semi-automatically the areas occupied by annual crops during the year. The results (100 m spatial resolution map) for the Mato Grosso State were compared with existing global datasets (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring-Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC) and Global Food Security-Support Analyses Data (GFSAD30)). Visually those maps present a good agreement, but the area estimated are not comparable since the agricultural class definition are different for those maps. In addition, we found 11.8 million ha of agricultural areas in the entire Brazilian territory. The area estimation for the Mato Grosso State was 3.4 million ha for 1 km dataset and 5.3 million ha for 100 m dataset. This difference is due to the spatial resolution of the PROBA-V datasets used. A coefficient of determination of 0.82 was found between PROBA-V 100 m and Landsat-8 OLI area estimations for the Mato Grosso State. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for detecting and mapping annual croplands distribution operationally using PROBA-V datasets for regional analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cropland Mapping; Linear Spectral Mixing Model; Mato Grosso State; Maximum Fraction Values Mosaic; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Food Supply; Image Resolution; Mapping; Regional Planning; Time Series; Vegetation; Agricultural Areas; Global Datasets; Global Food Security; Linear Spectral Mixing Models; Rapid Assessment; Regional Analysis; Spatial Resolution; Vegetation Fractions; Time Series Analysis","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Food supply; Image resolution; Mapping; Regional planning; Time series; Vegetation; Agricultural areas; Global datasets; Global food security; Linear spectral mixing models; Rapid assessment; Regional analysis; Spatial resolution; Vegetation fractions; Time series analysis","","","","Thenkabail, Prasad S., An automated cropland classification algorithm (ACCA) for Tajikistan by combining landsat, MODIS, and secondary data, Remote Sensing, 4, 10, pp. 2890-2918, (2012); See, Linda M., Improved global cropland data as an essential ingredient for food security, Global Food Security, 4, pp. 37-45, (2015); Jayne, Thomas S., Land pressures, the evolution of farming systems, and development strategies in Africa: A synthesis, Food Policy, 48, pp. 1-17, (2014); Matton, Nicolas, An automated method for annual cropland mapping along the season for various globally-distributed agrosystems using high spatial and temporal resolution time series, Remote Sensing, 7, 10, pp. 13208-13232, (2015); Lambert, Marie Julie, Cropland mapping over Sahelian and Sudanian agrosystems: A Knowledge-based approach using PROBA-V time series at 100-m, Remote Sensing, 8, 3, (2016); Gao, Feng, Toward mapping crop progress at field scales through fusion of Landsat and MODIS imagery, Remote Sensing of Environment, 188, pp. 9-25, (2017); Chen, Yaoliang, Mapping croplands, cropping patterns, and crop types using MODIS time-series data, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 69, pp. 133-147, (2018); Phalke, Aparna Ravindra, Large area cropland extent mapping with Landsat data and a generalized classifier, Remote Sensing of Environment, 219, pp. 180-195, (2018); Dias, Lívia Cristina Pinto, Patterns of land use, extensification, and intensification of Brazilian agriculture, Global Change Biology, 22, 8, pp. 2887-2903, (2016); Cohn, Avery Simon, Patterns and processes of pasture to crop conversion in Brazil: Evidence from Mato Grosso State, Land Use Policy, 55, pp. 108-120, (2016)","","MDPI AG rasetti@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","20724292","9780891814184; 0891814183; 9780123694072","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084250623"

However, global maps of nutrient limitation are still lacking. Here we examined global N and P limitation using the ratio of site-averaged leaf N and P resorption efficiencies of the dominant species across 171 sites. We evaluated our predictions using a global database of N- and P-limitation experiments based on nutrient additions at 106 and 53 sites, respectively. Globally, we found a shift from relative P to N limitation for both higher latitudes and precipitation seasonality and lower mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality, mean annual precipitation and soil clay fraction. Excluding cropland, urban and glacial areas, we estimate that 18% of the natural terrestrial land area is significantly limited by N, whereas 43% is relatively P limited. The remaining 39% of the natural terrestrial land area could be co-limited by N and P or weakly limited by either nutrient alone. This work provides both a new framework for testing nutrient limitation and a benchmark of N and P limitation for models to constrain predictions of the terrestrial carbon sink. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Land; Benchmarking; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sink; Climate Change; Database; Dominance; Nitrogen; Nutrient Limitation; Phosphorus; Precipitation (climatology); Seasonality","agricultural land; benchmarking; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; climate change; database; dominance; nitrogen; nutrient limitation; phosphorus; precipitation (climatology); seasonality","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41877328, 41630750 and 31400381), Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation (161015) and Project of State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface and Resource Ecology of Beijing Normal University (2017-ZY-07).

In particular, site-specific effects of NT on the soil pH, and soil physical properties including bulk density, total porosity, aggregate size and stability, hydraulic property, available water capacity have been intensively studied within various agroecosystems in the past decades. However, the synthesis of information on a global scale remains lacking. Here, using a global dataset based on 264 publications, effects of agronomic/environmental factors on soil physical properties under NT were quantified by intensive meta-analysis. We found that the effects of NT on soil physical properties are fairly complex, and greatly depend on climate conditions, experimental duration, and soil texture. Specifically, relative to CT, NT increased soil bulk density by 2.3%. Soil bulk density increased by 3.7% during the first 6 years of NT. Meanwhile, NT increased soil penetration resistance by 27.8%; NT decreased soil pH by 1.8%, the greatest reduction took place in silty soils (5.6%) or during a moderate-term NT (6–12 years, 5.0%). Nonetheless, regardless of environmental and agronomic factors, NT improved mean weight diameter and water-stable aggregate by 50 and 36%, respectively. Although NT had no effects on the saturated hydraulic conductivity, it enhanced soil available water capacity by 8.7%. Taken altogether, the trade-offs between observed negative effects such as increased bulk density and decreased soil pH; and positive effects such as improved aggregate size and stability, and soil water availability demonstrate the overall beneficial responses on soil physical property under global NT agriculture. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that climate conditions (e.g. mean annual precipitation and temperature), and experimental duration appeared to be the predominant factors controlling the response of soil properties to NT application. These results will help design site-specific NT management strategies considering highly informative, and prevalent environmental and agronomic factors within a local environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aggregate; Experimental Duration; Meta-analysis; Residue Retention; Soil Water Availability; Aggregates; Agronomy; Economic And Social Effects; Hydraulic Conductivity; Physical Properties; Soil Moisture; Textures; Available Water Capacities; Experimental Duration; Mean Annual Precipitation; Meta Analysis; Residue Retention; Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity; Soil Penetration Resistance; Soil Water Availability; Ph Effects; Aggregate Size; Available Water Capacity; Bulk Density; Climate Conditions; Meta-analysis; Ph; Physical Property; Soil Water; Water Availability; Zero Tillage","Aggregates; Agronomy; Economic and social effects; Hydraulic conductivity; Physical properties; Soil moisture; Textures; Available water capacities; Experimental duration; Mean annual precipitation; Meta analysis; Residue retention; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Soil penetration resistance; Soil water availability; pH effects; aggregate size; available water capacity; bulk density; climate conditions; meta-analysis; pH; physical property; soil water; water availability; zero tillage","","","Funding text 1: We thank all the researchers whose data were used in this meta-analysis.

To estimate the magnitude of pesticide drift from aerial or ground applications, regulatory agencies in North America, Europe, and elsewhere rely on spray drift models to predict spray drift deposition for risk assessments. Refined assessments should ultimately depend on best-available data for exposure modeling. However, when developing lower tier “screening” assessments designed to indicate whether further refinement is needed, regulators often make conservative assumptions with a resulting increased level of uncertainty in estimating environmental exposure or risk. In the United States, it is generally accepted that, to ensure conservative regulatory assessments, it is reasonable to assume that the wind speed might be 4.47 m/s (10 miles per hour [mph]), the relative humidity and temperature are highly conducive to drift, and the wind is blowing directly toward a receiving water for any given single spray event in a season. However, what is the probability these conditions will all co-occur for each of 4 sequential spray events spaced a week apart (common practice for insecticides)? The refined approach in the present study investigates this question using hourly meteorological data sets for 5 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standard crop scenarios to understand how real-world data can reduce unnecessary uncertainty for sequential applications. The impact of wind speeds, temperatures, relative humidity, and wind direction at different times of day on annual drift loadings has been examined using a stepwise process for comparison with corresponding regulatory default loading estimates. The impacts on drift estimates were significant; interestingly, the time of day of the applications impacted variability more than did the selected crop scenario. When all these real-world factors were considered, estimated 30-y total drift loads ranged from 2% to 5% greater than the default estimate (2 of 30 cases due to high afternoon wind speeds) to 51% to 86% reductions (25 of 30 cases) with an overall average reduction of 63%.

The removal of natural vegetation changes local climate, with human-dominated land uses often warmer and drier than natural habitats. Yet, it remains an open question whether land-use changes influence the composition of ecological assemblages in a direction consistent with the mechanism of local climatic change. Here, we used a global database of terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians) to test whether human-dominated land uses systematically favour species with distinctive realised climatic niches. We 1) explored the responses of community-average temperature and precipitation niches to different types of land use, 2) quantified the abundances of species with distinctive climatic niches across land uses and 3) tested for differences in emergent patterns in communities from tropical versus temperate latitudes. We found that, in comparison to species from undisturbed natural habitats, the average animal found in human-altered habitats lives in areas with higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures and higher maximum and lower minimum precipitation levels. We further found that tropical assemblages diverged more strongly than temperate assemblages between natural and human-altered habitats, possibly because tropical species are more sensitive to climatic conditions. These results strongly implicate the role of land-use change in favouring species affiliated with more extreme climatic conditions, thus systematically reshaping the composition of terrestrial biological assemblages. Our findings have the potential to inform species' vulnerability assessments and highlight the importance of preserving local climate refugia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity; Climate; Climatic Niche; Land-use Change; Terrestrial; Vertebrates; Air Temperature; Amphibian; Biodiversity; Bird; Community Response; Community Structure; Extreme Event; Land Use Change; Mammal; Population Growth; Precipitation (climatology); Refugium; Reptile; Vegetation Dynamics; Vulnerability; Amphibia; Animalia; Aves; Mammalia; Reptilia; Vertebrata","air temperature; amphibian; biodiversity; bird; community response; community structure; extreme event; land use change; mammal; population growth; precipitation (climatology); refugium; reptile; vegetation dynamics; vulnerability; Amphibia; Animalia; Aves; Mammalia; Reptilia; Vertebrata","","",").

Complex interactions between solid ash surfaces and volcanic gases lead to the formation of soluble salts that may be mobilized in aqueous environments. A variety of stakeholders may be concerned about the effects of ash on human and animal health, drinking water supplies, crops, soils and surface runoff. As part of the immediate emergency response, rapid dissemination of information regarding potentially hazardous concentrations of soluble species is critical. However, substantial variability in the methods used to characterize leachable elements makes it challenging to compare datasets and eruption impacts. To address these challenges, the International Volcanic Health Hazard Network (www.ivhhn.org) organized a two-day workshop to define appropriate methods for hazard assessment. The outcome of this workshop was a ‘consensus protocol’ for analysis of volcanic ash samples for rapid assessment of hazards from leachable elements, which was subsequently ratified by leading volcanological organizations. The purpose of this protocol is to recommend clear, standard and reliable methods applicable to a range of purposes during eruption response, such as assessing impacts on drinking-water supplies and ingestion hazards to livestock, and also applicable to research purposes. Where possible, it is intended that the methods make use of commonly available equipment and require little training. To evaluate method transferability, an interlaboratory comparison exercise was organized among six laboratories worldwide. Each laboratory received a split of pristine ash, and independently analyzed it according to the protocol for a wide range of elements. Collated results indicate good repeatability and reproducibility for most elements, thus indicating that the development of this protocol is a useful step towards providing standardized and reliable methods for ash hazard characterization. In this article, we review recent ash leachate studies, report the outcomes of the comparison exercise and present a revised and updated protocol based on the experiences and recommendations of the exercise participants. The adoption of standardized methods will improve and facilitate the comparability of results among studies and enable the ongoing development of a global database of leachate information relevant for informing volcanic health hazards assessment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hazard Assessment; Interlaboratory Comparison; Leachable Elements; Standardized Protocol; Volcanic Ashfall; Agriculture; Biohazards; Potable Water; Soils; Veterinary Medicine; Volcanoes; Water Supply; Aqueous Environment; Consensus Protocols; Hazard Assessment; Hazardous Concentrations; Hazards Assessments; Interlaboratory Comparison; Standardized Methods; Volcanic Ashfall; Health Hazards; Concentration (composition); Hazard Assessment; Interlaboratory Comparison; Leachate; Stakeholder; Standard (regulation); Volcanic Ash; Volcanic Eruption; Animalia","Agriculture; Biohazards; Potable water; Soils; Veterinary medicine; Volcanoes; Water supply; Aqueous environment; Consensus protocols; Hazard Assessment; Hazardous concentrations; Hazards assessments; Interlaboratory comparison; Standardized methods; Volcanic ashfall; Health hazards; concentration (composition); hazard assessment; interlaboratory comparison; leachate; stakeholder; standard (regulation); volcanic ash; volcanic eruption; Animalia","","","Funding text 1: Our thanks to Peter Baxter, Julie Calkins, Kristi Wallace and Paul Ayris for advice and input; Thomas Wilson at the University of Canterbury for funding one of the authors (CS) to the Durham workshop; and Sara Peek, Bill Evans and Kate Scheiderich at the U.S. Geological Survey.

Erosion and high sediment loads in rivers cause reservoir siltation and decrease storage capacity, which pose risk on water security for citizens, agriculture, and industry. In regions where resources for management are limited, identifying spatial-temporal variability of sediment sources is crucial to decrease siltation. Despite widespread availability of rigorous methods, approaches simplifying spatial and temporal variability of erosion are often inappropriately applied to very data sparse semi-arid regions. In this work, we review existing approaches for mapping erosional hotspots, and provide an example of spatial-temporal mapping approach in two case study regions.

Efficient and sustainable maintenance of water reservoirs and supply networks implies a holistic strategy that takes into account, as much as possible, information from the stages of water usage. Next,-generation decision-making software tools, for supporting water management, require the integration of multiple and heterogeneous data sources of different knowledge domains. In this regard, Linked Data and SemanticWeb technologies enable harmonization of different data sources, as well as the efficient querying for feeding upper-level Business Intelligence processes. This work investigates the design, implementation and usage of a semantic approach driven by ontology to capture, store, integrate and exploit real-world data concerning water supply networks management. As a main contribution, the proposal helps with obtaining semantically enriched linked data, enhancing the analysis of water network performance. For validation purposes, in the use case, a series of data sources from different measures have been considered, in the scope of an actual water management system of the Mediterranean region of Valencia (Spain), throughout several years of activity.

Past efforts in understanding whether, and to what extent, adaptation improves household welfare have faced some key challenges including: 1) endogeneity of adaptation; 2) localized results that are difficult to generalize; and 3) understanding whether the efficacy of adaptation depends on the reasons for adaptation (e.g. market conditions vs climate change). In this study we estimate effects of smallholder agricultural adaptation on food security, while addressing each of these three challenges. First, we identify and test instrumental variables based on neighbor networks. Second, we use a dataset that contains information from 5159 households located across 15 countries in Africa, Asia, and Central America. Third, we investigate whether adaptation that is motivated by changes in market conditions influences the efficacy of adaptation differently than adaptation motivated by climate change. Across our global sample, an average household made almost 10 adaptive changes, which are responsible for approximately 47 days of food security yearly; an amount nearly 4 times larger than is indicated if endogeneity is not addressed. But these effects vary depending on what is motivating adaptation. Adaptation in response to climate change alone is not found to significantly affect food security. When climate adaptation is paired with adaptation in response to changing market conditions, the resulting impact is 96 food secure days. These results suggest the need for further work on the careful design of climate change interventions to complement adaptive activities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation; Food Security; Global Dataset; Instrumental Variables; Smallholder Agriculture; Adaptive Management; Agricultural Application; Data Set; Environmental Impact Assessment; Food Security; Global Change; Smallholder; Africa; Asia; Central America","adaptive management; agricultural application; data set; environmental impact assessment; food security; global change; smallholder; Africa; Asia; Central America","","","“This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Trust Fund and through bilateral funding agreements.

A warming climate tends to increase precipitation in many areas. Therefore, studying the relationship between temperature and precipitation is crucial for providing information precipitation prediction in many areas. The information on the relationship between precipitation and temperature will be very useful for a lot of fields such as ecological analysis, agriculture, and business. The correlation between monthly total precipitation and monthly mean temperature over the 30-year period from 1970 to 2000 using WorldClim global database data for Bandung city at ~ 1 km2 resolution was calculated and analyzed. Geographically weighted regression has been used to estimate regression coefficients of mean temperature on precipitation which allow varying over space and time.

The agriculture industry is one of the most challenging areas for these changes, especially in Northern Ireland, as agriculture is one of the larger industries. Research has been carried out across the island of Ireland into methods of improving farm efficiency in multiple areas of farming, including livestock health, machinery improvements, and crop growth. Research has been carried out in this study into grass growth in the dairy farming sector, specifically within Northern Ireland. Grass growth prediction aims to inform farmers and policy makers in their decision-making process regarding sustainable land management in agriculture. The present work focuses on analysing and evaluating how data-driven classifiers can be used for grass growth prediction using the data related to soil content, weather, grass quality components etc. Four classifiers, namely Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and Neural Networks, are chosen for this purpose. Classification results based on a real-world data set are analysed and compared to evaluate and illustrate the performance and robustness of the classifiers. The results indicate that it is difficult to declare a single classifier with the highest performance and robustness. Nevertheless, it indicates that tree classification methods are better suited to the data to be studied, as opposed to probabilistic methods and weighted methods, e.g., the naïve Bayes classifier obtained a predictive performance of 78% when classifying spring seasonal grass growth data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Data-driven Classifier; Grass Growth Prediction; Agricultural Robots; Climate Change; Decision Making; Decision Trees; Forecasting; Forestry; Information Management; Knowledge Based Systems; Land Use; Machinery; Agriculture Industries; Classification Methods; Classification Results; Decision Making Process; Predictive Performance; Probabilistic Methods; Quality Components; Sustainable Land Managements; Classification (of Information)","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Decision making; Decision trees; Forecasting; Forestry; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Land use; Machinery; Agriculture industries; Classification methods; Classification results; Decision making process; Predictive performance; Probabilistic methods; Quality components; Sustainable land managements; Classification (of information)","","","","Parliament of the United Kingdom, (2008); Committee on Climate Change Reducing Emissions in Northern Ireland, (2019); McDonnell, Jack, Weather forecasts to enhance an Irish grass growth model, European Journal of Agronomy, 105, pp. 168-175, (2019); McHugh, Orla, A decision analytic framework and exploratory statistical case study analysis of grass growth in Northern Ireland, Journal of Advances in Information Technology, 11, 1, pp. 15-20, (2020); Ruelle, Elodie, Development of the Moorepark St Gilles grass growth model (MoSt GG model): A predictive model for grass growth for pasture based systems, European Journal of Agronomy, 99, pp. 80-91, (2018); Ayub, Umair, Predicting crop diseases using data mining approaches: Classification, pp. 1-6, (2018); International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology, (2025); Ali, Iftikhar, Modeling Managed Grassland Biomass Estimation by Using Multitemporal Remote Sensing Data-A Machine Learning Approach, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 10, 7, pp. 3254-3264, (2017); Corrales, David Camilo, Toward detecting crop diseases and pest by supervised learning, Ingenieria y Universidad, 19, 1, pp. 207-228, (2015); Chawla, Nitesh Vinay, SMOTE: Synthetic minority over-sampling technique, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16, pp. 321-357, (2002)","Lesot, M.-J.; Vieira, S.; Reformat, M.Z.; Carvalho, J.P.; Wilbik, A.; Bouchon-Meunier, B.; Yager, R.R.","Springer","","18th International Conference on Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems, IPMU 2020","","Lisbon","240699","18650937; 18650929","9789819671748; 9789819664610; 9783032026743; 9783032008831; 9783032026712; 9789819671779; 9783031949425; 9789819666874; 9783031936968; 9783031941207","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086262116"

Farmers are facing huge challenges in cultivation, such as illnesses. Automated identification of disease in leaf and system of preventing the crops from the disease are much supportive. The previous work designed a system for recognition of disease in rice blast via Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, it provides low performance since the infection area is not accurately segmented and also it does not support multi-label prediction. In this proposed research work, Region of Interest (ROI) based Bat Algorithm (BA) and prediction of multi-label leaf diseases are done by Enhanced Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ECNN) approach. Initially, dataset for both plant village and rice leaf diseases are considered input data. The preprocessing of leaf images is performed by means of median filtering approach. ROI based bat optimization performs segmentation of the preprocessed image to extract the exact disease regions. Segmentation accuracy is major objective of the bat algorithm. The Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and shape features are extracted on region of segmented area. Based on these features, Enhanced deep Convolutional Neural Network (ECNN) is used for multi-label leaf diseases prediction. To minimize the error value, weighted mean is computed in ECNN. ECNN proposed classifier results are evaluated with current approaches for various metrics like accuracy and sensitivity. Multi-label leaf diseases prediction is implemented by proposed models and the performance is measured by using real-world datasets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bat Optimization Algorithm; Enhanced Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ecnn) And Multi-label Diseases Prediction; Leaf Disease; Region Of Interest (roi)","","","","","Meena Prakash, Ramasamy, Detection of leaf diseases and classification using digital image processing, 2018-January, pp. 1-4, (2017); International Journal of Information and Electronics Engineering, (2012); Zhang, Shanwen, Leaf image based cucumber disease recognition using sparse representation classification, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 134, pp. 135-141, (2017); Er, Meng Joo, An online universal classifier for binary, multi-class and multi-label classification, pp. 3701-3706, (2017); International Journal of Application or Innovation in Engineering Management, (2013); Al Bashish, Dheeb, Detection and classification of leaf diseases using K-means-based segmentation and neural-networks-based classification, Information Technology Journal, 10, 2, pp. 267-275, (2011); Liang, Wanjie, Rice Blast Disease Recognition Using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network, Scientific Reports, 9, 1, (2019); Ali, Hussam, Symptom based automated detection of citrus diseases using color histogram and textural descriptors, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 138, pp. 92-104, (2017); Rastogi, Aakanksha, Leaf disease detection and grading using computer vision technology & fuzzy logic, pp. 500-505, (2015); Padol, Pranjali B., SVM classifier based grape leaf disease detection, pp. 175-179, (2016)","","Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. dheep.infotel@gmail.com","","","","","","1943023X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085312606"

The resultant system was tested on an existent data-set captured in controlled conditions as well our new real-world data-set captured on a real strawberry farm over two months. We utilise F<inf>1</inf> score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, to show our system matches the state-of-the-art detection accuracy (F<inf>1</inf>: 0.793 vs. 0.799) in controlled conditions; has greater generalisation and robustness to variation of spatial parameters (camera viewpoint) in the real-world data-set (F<inf>1</inf>: 0.744); and at a fraction of the computational cost allowing classification at almost 30fps. We propose that the L*a*b*Fruits system addresses some of the most pressing limitations of current fruit detection systems and is well-suited to application in areas such as yield forecasting and harvesting. Beyond the target application in agriculture this work also provides a proof-of-principle whereby increased performance is achieved through analysis of the domain data, capturing features at the input level rather than simply increasing model complexity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Robotics; Bio-inspired; Computer Vision; Deep Learning; Fruit Detection; Fruit Localisation; Multi-modal; One-stage Networks; Outdoor Detection; Strawberry Perception; Biomimetics; Cameras; Classification (of Information); Computer Vision; Fruits; Virtual Reality; Agricultural Process; Agricultural Robotics; Bio-inspired; Controlled Conditions; Industrial Environments; Localisation; Multi-modal; Precision And Recall; Deep Learning","Biomimetics; Cameras; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Fruits; Virtual reality; Agricultural process; Agricultural robotics; Bio-inspired; Controlled conditions; Industrial environments; Localisation; Multi-modal; Precision and recall; Deep learning","","","","Si, Yongsheng, Location of apples in trees using stereoscopic vision, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 112, pp. 68-74, (2015); Kaczmarek, Adam Łukasz, Stereo vision with Equal Baseline Multiple Camera Set (EBMCS) for obtaining depth maps of plants, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 135, pp. 23-37, (2017); Meulebroeck, Wendy, Photonics enhanced sensors for food monitoring: Part 1, IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Magazine, 19, 6, pp. 35-45, (2016); Maldonado, Walter, Automatic green fruit counting in orange trees using digital images, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 127, pp. 572-581, (2016); Dey, Debadeepta, Classification of plant structures from uncalibrated image sequences, Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision, pp. 329-336, (2012); Song, Yu, Automatic fruit recognition and counting from multiple images, Biosystems Engineering, 118, 1, pp. 203-215, (2014); Qureshi, Waqar Shahid, Dense segmentation of textured fruits in video sequences, 2, pp. 441-447, (2014); Sa, Inkyu, Deepfruits: A fruit detection system using deep neural networks, Sensors, 16, 8, (2016); Lin, Tsungyi, Feature pyramid networks for object detection, 2017-January, pp. 936-944, (2017); He, Kaiming, Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 770-778, (2016)","","MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","14248220","","","31947829","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077703251"

The aim of this study is to investigate the trend of ES valuation (ESV) associated with land use/land cover (LULC) change. LULC datasets from 1988 to 2018 and the global ESV coefficient were used to conduct the estimation of ESVs and their changes through ArcGIS. The agricultural provisioning ESVs were also collected from the field to compare with the global ESV data. The total ESV decreased from US$481.85 million in 1988 to US$445.5 million in 2018, with a decreasing rate of US$1.21 million per year. Within this period, the largest ESV increment was observed in cultivated land with an increasing of US$33.47 million, and the largest decreasing was observed in grazing land with a decreasing of US$47.35 million. Based on local and global data, the agriculture land ESV were US$8,610.34 and US$1.34 million ha−1 year−1, respectively. This indicates a significance difference between local study and global ESV data. Overall, the decreasing of ESVs indicated that the environment is degrading due to the land conversion and this suggest sustainable development projects as intervention are required. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ecosystem Service Valuation; Land Use/land Cover Change; Omo Gibe Basin; Winike Watershed","","","","This study was funded by the Benefit CASCAPE project in Ethiopia for field data collection.

These technologies increase productivity as well as reduce labor significantly. In this paper, we focus on improving the autonomous cow estrus detection system in terms of energy consumption and precision. In previous detection pipelines, an accelerometer is mounted to the neck of cows to capture motion data with high frequency, followed by the ML algorithm to check the data and determine whether it is in estrus or not. Instead, we configured the accelerometer to sample with low frequency for minimizing its energy consumption. However, low-sampling rate as input of ML pipeline leads to an undesirable higher false alarm rate. To solve this problems, we designed a pipeline of unsupervised learning with a new heuristic post-processing algorithm. The proposed post-processing algorithm is a backtracking algorithm that incorporates the timing constraint of the period obtained by agriculture knowledge. With the constraint, the postprocessing algorithm facilitates a significantly higher precision than simple adaptive threshold techniques in previous studies on a simulated dataset. Finally, the overall result of the pipeline with the proposed algorithm is visualized on real-world data captured on the farm in our agriculture department. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Estrus Detection; Internet Of Things; Unsupervised Learning; Accelerometers; Agricultural Robots; Agriculture; Energy Utilization; Internet Of Things; Pipeline Processing Systems; Unsupervised Learning; Accelerometer Sensor; Backtracking Algorithm; Detection System; False Alarm Rate; High Frequency Hf; Internet Of Things (iot); Postprocessing Algorithms; Timing Constraints; Pipelines","Accelerometers; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Pipeline processing systems; Unsupervised learning; Accelerometer sensor; Backtracking algorithm; Detection system; False alarm rate; High frequency HF; Internet of Things (IOT); Postprocessing algorithms; Timing constraints; Pipelines","","","Finally, we would like to thank the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) for supporting Vietnamese students.

In this study we combine global datasets on the distribution of mammals and birds with species traits and phylogenetic data and we identify conservation priorities for taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, as well as for three ecosystem services, including potential for carbon sequestration, pollination potential and groundwater recharge. We show that, when priority areas are identified based only on individual, e.g. functional diversity, or any combination of the three biodiversity components, these areas do not allow a sufficient protection of the three ecosystem services. However, an integrated approach whereby prioritization is based on all biodiversity components and ecosystem services would allow to identify areas that maximize protection of all ecosystem services with a minimal loss in biodiversity coverage. Our results highlight the need for an integrated conservation planning framework in order to optimally allocate resources and achieve the long-term preservation of the multiple dimensions of biodiversity and ecosystems services. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ground Water; Agriculture; Animal; Biodiversity; Bird; Carbon Sequestration; Ecosystem; Environmental Protection; Evolution; Geography; Health Care Planning; Human; Mammal; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Pollination; Procedures; Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Birds; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Geography; Groundwater; Health Resources; Humans; Mammals; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Pollination","ground water; agriculture; animal; biodiversity; bird; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; environmental protection; evolution; geography; health care planning; human; mammal; phenotype; phylogeny; pollination; procedures; Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Birds; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Geography; Groundwater; Health Resources; Humans; Mammals; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Pollination","","","This project was supported by the European Research Council (ERC-2012-StG-310886-HISTFUNC, to J.-C.S.).

We set out to answer this question in the context of Morocco and Turkey by taking into account the impact of climate change on agricultural international markets at the global level. We use the GTAP model, combined with a newly developed global database on climate change impacts on agricultural crop sectors by 2050 as captured by yield projections. Results suggest that the more trade is liberalised, the higher global welfare gains are. However, the gains are not large enough to offset the loss from climate change impacts on agricultural productivity globally. In Morocco, agricultural trade liberalisation, on average, induces additional welfare losses. The main drivers are the deterioration in the terms of trade that offsets all the potential gains from the better allocation of economic resources due to free trade. For Turkey, trade liberalisation induces net welfare gains under all scenarios. The larger the tariff elimination scheme, the larger the net gains due to the more efficient allocation of economic resources, which partially offset the impact of declining terms of trade. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Cge Model; Climate Change; Trade Liberalisation","","","","This paper is one of a series of studies prepared within the World Institute for Development Economics Research of the United Nations University (UNU-WIDER) project on “The Middle East, North Africa, and Climate Change,” directed by Wallace E.

Rarefaction was used to estimate global Phytophthora species richness. We applied a framework, leveraging geographically and economically biased pathogen data against environmental and socioeconomic metrics to model their distribution. Hierarchical clustering of host and country range allowed characterisation of invasion potential. Phytophthora descriptions rose to 86 by the year 2000, surging to over 180 species to date driven primarily by novel molecular techniques, resulting in a species richness estimate of 326 (95% CI: 274–378). Countries with diverse ecosystems and entrenched agricultural and forestry industries supported by intensive research programmes reported the highest diversity. Constructing principal components from enviro-socioeconomic factors highlighted national data deficits, showing that two-thirds of trading nations have reported lower-than-predicted species numbers. Phytophthora species clustered into two main invasiveness groups as either cosmopolitan generalists or specialists, historically tied to agriculture. Further spread and detection of Phytophthora pathogens are inevitable with increasing global trade, especially in developing and emerging economies. Adoption of best practice diagnostics and enhanced resource and data sharing are crucial for coordinated global pathogen surveillance and biosecurity. This research aimed to test the following hypotheses: • The global distribution of Phytophthora species is associated with environmental, social and economic traits of different country's. • Models for Phytophthora diversity, incorporating environmental, social and economic characteristics, can be used to predict a countries trade risk. • Phytophthora species biogeography and host range can be used to predict invasiveness and a country's conduciveness to infection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biological Invasions; Biosecurity Risk Analysis; Data Deficit; Plant Disease; Plant Imports; Plant Pathogens; Agriculture; Article; Biogeography; Biosecurity; Ecosystem; Environmental Factor; Evolution; Forestry; Fungal Plant Disease; Hierarchical Clustering; Host Range; Invasive Species; Microbial Diversity; Nonhuman; Phytopathogen; Phytophthora; Priority Journal; Risk; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomics; Species Diversity; Species Invasion; Species Richness","agriculture; Article; biogeography; biosecurity; ecosystem; environmental factor; evolution; forestry; fungal plant disease; hierarchical clustering; host range; invasive species; microbial diversity; nonhuman; phytopathogen; Phytophthora; priority journal; risk; risk assessment; socioeconomics; species diversity; species invasion; species richness","","","We thank the New Zealand Better Border Biosecurity network for supporting this work.

Whether crop yield-related ecosystem services can be maintained by a few dominant species or rely on high richness remains unclear. Using a global database from 89 studies (with 1475 locations), we partition the relative importance of species richness, abundance, and dominance for pollination; biological pest control; and final yields in the context of ongoing land-use change. Pollinator and enemy richness directly supported ecosystem services in addition to and independent of abundance and dominance. Up to 50% of the negative effects of landscape simplification on ecosystem services was due to richness losses of service-providing organisms, with negative consequences for crop yields.

In addition there are now readily available national and global datasets, such as rainfall and MODIS, which can be used to represent the crop-growing environment. Rather than analysing one field at a time as is typical in precision agriculture research, there is an opportunity to explore the value of combining data over multiple fields/farms and years into one dataset. Using these datasets in conjunction with machine learning approaches allows predictive models of crop yield to be built. In this study, several large farms in Western Australia were used as a case study, and yield monitor data from wheat, barley and canola crops from three different seasons (2013, 2014 and 2015) that covered ~ 11 000 to ~ 17 000 hectares in each year were used. The yield data were processed to a 10 m grid, and for each observation point associated predictor variables in space and time were collated. The data were then aggregated to a 100 m spatial resolution for modelling yield. Random forest models were used to predict crop yield of wheat, barley and canola using this dataset. Three separate models were created based on pre-sowing, mid-season and late-season conditions to explore the changes in the predictive ability of the model as more within-season information became available. These time points also coincide with points in the season when a management decision is made, such as the application of fertiliser. The models were evaluated with cross-validation using both fields and years for data splitting, and this was assessed at the field spatial resolution. Cross-validated results showed the models predicted yield relatively accurately, with a root mean square error of 0.36 to 0.42 t ha−1, and a Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient of 0.89 to 0.92 at the field resolution. The models performed better as the season progressed, largely because more information about within-season data became available (e.g. rainfall). The more years of yield data that were available for a field, the better the predictions were, and future work should use a longer time-series of yield data. The generic nature of this method makes it possible to apply to other agricultural systems where yield monitor data is available. Future work should also explore the integration of more data sources into the models, focus on predicting at finer spatial resolutions within fields, and the possibility of using the yield forecasts to guide management decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Empirical Yield Prediction; Feature Extraction; Machine Learning; Precision Agriculture; Random Forest; Remote Sensing; Yield Forecast; Agricultural Research; Algorithm; Barley; Canola; Crop Yield; Data Set; Empirical Analysis; Forecasting Method; Machine Learning; Modis; Precision Agriculture; Prediction; Rainfall; Remote Sensing; Soil Test; Spatial Resolution; Time Series Analysis; Wheat; Australia; Western Australia; Brassica Napus Var.

Indices exist to identify sensor data with structured spatial variation, conducive to site-specific management. However, these indices do not indicate if this spatial variation is driven by managerial or environmental effects. A new index is proposed to identify perennial (or ordered row) fields that are likely or highly likely to have management effects within the spatial pattern of sensor data. This is determined by investigating differences in anisotropic (directional) variograms parallel and perpendicular to the direction of management (row orientation). Small differences are indicative of isotropic (environmental-driven) variation. Large differences indicate row and management effects. The index is derived, run on a database of 1080 simulated fields and applied to yield data from 124 vineyard blocks to assess index performance and response to different levels of variation. Simulations showed that the index is non-responsive to the magnitude of variation but responds strongly to anisotropy in the data. The stochastic variance in the data was observed to have an effect on index response and may be problematic when applied to noisy data sets. The index scores for the simulated and real-world data showed a similar pattern of response and the index was able to identify vineyard blocks where differential row management had generated differing yield responses. The index scores are continuous and some general guidelines for use of the index are proposed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anisotropy; Horticulture; Variograms; Viticulture; Agricultural Management; Anisotropy; Crop Production; Environmental Effect; Environmental Monitoring; Field Method; Horticulture; Index Method; Performance Assessment; Simulation; Spatial Analysis; Spatial Variation; Stochasticity; Variogram; Vineyard; Viticulture; Yield Response","agricultural management; anisotropy; crop production; environmental effect; environmental monitoring; field method; horticulture; index method; performance assessment; simulation; spatial analysis; spatial variation; stochasticity; variogram; vineyard; viticulture; yield response","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Bob, Dawn and Thom Betts in providing the vineyard yield data and helpful commentary on the index outputs.

On a global scale, most methods focus on one major sector, such as irrigated agriculture which accounts for a substantial portion of groundwater use on a global-scale. However, this may misrepresent groundwater abstractions in regions significantly impacted by other sectors on a local-scale. The objective of this paper is to quantify annual average groundwater use through a multi-method sectoral approach for regions where groundwater abstraction data are scarce. Sectoral methods are developed for the annual volumetric quantification and spatial distribution of groundwater use for municipal water distribution systems, private domestic well users in municipal and rural regions, industrial use for manufacturing, mining, and oil and gas industries, irrigated agriculture, and finfish aquaculture. Results suggest that British Columbia (BC) uses a total of ∼562 million cubic metres of groundwater annually. The largest annual groundwater use by major sector is agriculture (38%), finfish aquaculture (21%), industrial (16%), municipal water distribution systems (15%), and domestic private well users (11%). This paper highlights the implications of using downscaled values of groundwater use from global datasets for aquifer-scale estimates, which can be misrepresentative in regions where groundwater use is unregulated or newly regulated, as is the case in BC. The sectoral methods developed in this paper provide a framework for estimating groundwater-specific use estimates in data scarce regions critical for groundwater management plans and aquifer-scale groundwater stress studies which depend on spatially-distributed groundwater use data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Analysis; Groundwater Abstraction; Groundwater Use; Agriculture; Aquaculture; Aquifers; Data Reduction; Spatial Distribution; Water Distribution Systems; Water Management; British Columbia; British Columbia , Canada; Climatic Variation; Groundwater Abstraction; Groundwater Management Plan; Groundwater Use; Irrigated Agriculture; Oil And Gas Industry; Groundwater Resources","Agriculture; Aquaculture; Aquifers; Data reduction; Spatial distribution; Water distribution systems; Water management; British Columbia; British Columbia , Canada; Climatic variation; Groundwater abstraction; Groundwater management plan; Groundwater use; Irrigated agriculture; Oil and Gas Industry; Groundwater resources","","","This project was funded by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change of British Columbia in a provincial scale aquifer-stress study.","Aeschbach, Werner, Regional strategies for the accelerating global problem of groundwater depletion, Nature Geoscience, 5, 12, pp. 853-861, (2012); Global Change and Global Scenarios of Water Use and Availability an Application of Watergap 1 0, (1997); Alley, William Morgan, Groundwater Development Stress: Global-Scale Indices Compared to Regional Modeling, Ground Water, 56, 2, pp. 266-275, (2018); Selected Exploration Projects and Operating Mines in British Columbia 2015 British Columbia Geologcal Survey, (2016); US Geol Surv Circ, (2012); 2013 Annual Report on Water Use for Oil and Gas Activity, (2013); 2014 Annual Report on Water Use for Oil and Gas Activity, (2014); 2015 Annual Report on Water Management for Oil and Gas Activity; Guide to Using the BC Aquifer Classification Maps for the Protection and Management of Groundwater, (2002); Bredehoeft, John D., Conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water for irrigated agriculture: Risk aversion, Water Resources Research, 19, 5, pp. 1111-1121, (1983)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","07011784","","CWRJD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073601717"

Of which, bio-culturally diverse North-Eastern states nurture thousands of landraces with poorly tapped agronomic traits. In the present study, 27 standard microsatellite data from 171 rice landraces from six states were analysed to understand their genetic diversity and population structure. Further, combining with a global dataset, we determined subpopulation identity using both model-based and multivariate analyses to uncover their history. We found moderate to high genetic diversity and high differentiation [standardized G<inf>ST</inf> = 0.57]. The AMOVA partitioned overall variance into within population (75%) and among population (25%). The landraces from six states remained at various degrees of differentiation (pairwise F<inf>ST</inf> = 0.09-0.41). We have detected a preponderance of aus-type in a majority of aromatic landraces. Rests were japonica and admixed with a little representation of indica. The presence of aromatic aus probably implied assimilation into local culture from the primary aus growing region of Bangladesh and India. Likewise, the arrival of japonica may stem from the exchange of goods among neighbouring dynasties via Southern and Southwestern Silk routes. The shared ancestry may reflect a merger of two ancient cultures. Our analyses also uncovered the existence of aus-type short and medium grain aromatic rice predicting an origin of aroma in aus subpopulation. Collectively, it demonstrated the diversity and divergent history of the rice landraces have been shaped by various socio-cultural interactions operative over time and space. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agro-biodiversity; Aroma Origin; Aromatic Rice Landraces; Aus; Chakhao; Indica; Joha; North-east India; Southern And Southwestern Silk Route; Tai","","","","Authors would like to thank Dr Utpal Basu of the Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Kalyani, Surajit Ghosh and Debanjan Bhattacharya for their suggestion and assistance at various stages of the study.

The use of agricultural land maps becomes increasingly important. The governments, private sectors, research agencies, and community groups rely on land use mapping data for natural resource assessment, monitoring, and planning. Finding an effective mapping approach is thereby crucial for natural resource condition monitoring and investment, agricultural productivity, sustainability and planning, biodiversity conservation, natural disaster management, and bio-security. In this paper, four machine learning algorithms, i.e., the classic k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and newly developed Capsule Network (CapsNet), are applied to classify satellite images for land use. For comprehensively comparing the performance of different algorithms for land use mapping, the experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets. Based on the experiment results, several improvements on the algorithms are proposed in order to fulfil the requirement of a large-scale land mapping. In addition, we design and implement these algorithms for land use mapping in a Machine Learning Land Use Mapping (ML-LUM) system. The system is able to train the models, predict classifications of satellite images, map the land use, display the land use statistic data, and predict production yields. With a friendly graphic user interface for farmers, the system is implemented by using the cloud computing technique for processing large land use data. Furthermore, we present a case study. For the case study, a banana plantation area from a given satellite image is correctly marked and the area size is then calculated, together with predicting banana production. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capsule Network; Classification; Cnn; Image Data Mining; Land Use Mapping; Visualization; Agricultural Robots; Biodiversity; Classification (of Information); Condition Monitoring; Conservation; Convolutional Neural Networks; Data Mining; Data Visualization; Disaster Prevention; Disasters; Economics; Flow Visualization; Forecasting; Fruits; Image Classification; Investments; Land Use; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Natural Resources; Nearest Neighbor Search; Productivity; Satellites; Support Vector Machines; Agricultural Productivity; Biodiversity Conservation; Design And Implements; Graphic User Interface; Image Data Minings; K Nearest Neighbours (k-nn); Land-use Mappings; Support Vector Machine (svms); Mapping","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Classification (of information); Condition monitoring; Conservation; Convolutional neural networks; Data mining; Data visualization; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Economics; Flow visualization; Forecasting; Fruits; Image classification; Investments; Land use; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural resources; Nearest neighbor search; Productivity; Satellites; Support vector machines; Agricultural productivity; Biodiversity conservation; Design and implements; Graphic user interface; Image data minings; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); Land-use mappings; Support vector machine (SVMs); Mapping","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61877020 ).

Due to its complexity, traditional agriculture method relies on manual counting, which is obviously inefficient and a waste of manpower. The challenging aspects like partial occlusion, overlapping and different perspectives even limit the usage of traditional computer vision techniques. In recent years, deep learning has become more and more popular for computer vision applications, because of its superior performance comparing to traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a deep learning solution to address the pig counting problem. We present a modified Counting Convolutional Neural Network (Counting CNN) model according to the structure of ResNeXt, and tune a series of experimental parameters. Our CNN model learns the mapping from the image feature to the density map, and obtains the total number of pigs in the entire image by integrating the density map. In order to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset collected from actual piggery farming with 15 pigs in an image averagely.

However, these data, often 1&thinsp;km at the finest scale available, are too coarse for applications such as precise designation of conservation priority areas and regional species distribution modeling, or purposes outside of biology such as city planning and precision agriculture. Further, these global datasets likely underestimate local climate variations because they do not incorporate locally relevant variables. Here we describe a comprehensive set of 30&thinsp;m resolution rasters for Hong Kong, a small tropical territory with highly variable terrain where intense anthropogenic disturbance meets a robust protected area system. The data include topographic variables, a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index raster, and interpolated climate variables based on weather station observations. We present validation statistics that convey each climate variable's reliability and compare our results to a widely used global dataset, finding that our models consistently reflect greater climatic variation. To our knowledge, this is the first set of published environmental rasters specific to Hong Kong. We hope this diverse suite of geographic data will facilitate future environmental and ecological studies in this region of the world, where a spatial understanding of rapid urbanization, introduced species pressure, and conservation efforts is critical.

Loss of trees caused by the Emerald Ash Borer pest had a significant public health impact due to an increase in mortality related to cardiovascular and respiratory-tract illness [2]. Outbreaks of UG99 wheat rust strain can cause up to 100% crop losses of wheat and is viewed as a potential worldwide disaster with massive implications for global food security [6]. In Canada, an outbreak of Potato Wart disease in 2000 resulted in $280 million in costs to the provincial economy of Prince Edward Island [1]. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has completed decades of risk analyses for various crop commodities and specific pests/pathogens. These analyses characterize the risk of exotic pests to Canada and support regulatory decision-making and response actions. This information is currently stored and maintained in a myriad of disconnected databases, spreadsheets, and technical documents under the control of the Plant Health Risk Assessment Unit. This private corpus represents a unique source of invaluable analyses tailored to the Canadian context, which are not found anywhere else in the world. Additional risk information for other countries is drawn from the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO)1 global database of country regulated pests and the U.S. Department of Agriculture-AZs (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regulated plant pest list2. The cost of next generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA has decreased exponentially[10]. As a consequence, academic institutions are aggressively staffing positions in environmental metagenomics, and while these researchers may not be specifically looking for plant pests or pathogens, or even human pathogens, large volumes of data with a wide range of species names will be automatically generated and be made publicly available and searchable on the web. The generation of large amount of DNA sequence data from Canadian samples creates exciting opportunities. At the same time, there is an inherent risk to trade should a quarantine organism in a Canadian sample be detected that is not currently known to exist in Canada. Interpretation or misinterpretation of species identification from such studies at their face value could potentially trigger trade issues. The study seeks to evaluate the benefits and means to actively link quantitative Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) sample data with qualitative risk assessment information. This will guide policy and operational decision-making for rapid detection, surveillance and response against plant health threats and to set a new scientific standard for knowledge-based international trade actions for the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries. One of the goals of this study is to evaluate the use of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to extract pest risk information from the CFIA risk corpus. This study is limited to fungi that are pathogens, partially to limit its initial scope. The fungi are taxonomic group that arguably have some of the most complex taxonomic naming problems due to (among other things) the anamorph-teleomorph-holomorph[8] issue3. Collecting the fungal names synonyms is needed to canonicalize the fungal names found both in the risks sources and the NGS identification results. Previous work on risk has not looked at risk such as in this study which examines the risk of pathogenic species on the trade and agriculture. This previous work has looked at the broader topic of event extraction for decision support[3], corporate risk[4]. More recent work has examined risk in a more granular fashion, such as supplier selection[7] and more specifically, assessing the likelihood (risk) of child labour by suppliers[9],. The poster will provide early results of this stage of the project, primarily the risk extraction from the CFIA (Canadian) corpus, the risk and organism names for other countries from the EPPO and the USDA, and the collection and rationalization of the fungal synonym naming from Mycobank and Index Fungorum. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fungi; Next Generation Sequencing; Risk; Test Mining; Text Analysis; Crops; Decision Making; Decision Support Systems; Digital Libraries; Electronic Trading; Extraction; Fisheries; Food Supply; Forestry; Fungi; Gene Encoding; Health Risks; International Trade; Knowledge Based Systems; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Linguistics; Natural Language Processing Systems; Pathogens; Risk Analysis; Risks; Animal And Plant Health Inspection Services; Canadian Food Inspection Agencies; Machine Learning Techniques; Next-generation Sequencing; Qualitative Risk Assessment; Test Mining; Text Analysis; U.s.

This question has considerable relevance and practical implications for precision agriculture as visible spatial differences in crop development and yield are often directly related to horizontal and vertical variations in soil texture caused by, for example, complex deposition/erosion processes. In addition, active and relict geomorphological settings, such as floodplains and buried paleochannels, can cast significant complexity into surface hydrology and crop modeling. This also requires a better approach to detect, quantify, and analyze topsoil and subsoil heterogeneity and soil-crop interaction. In this work, we introduce a novel unsupervised Bayesian pattern recognition framework to address the extraction of these complex patterns. The proposed approach is first validated using two synthetic data sets and then applied to real-world data sets of three test fields, which consists of satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series and proximal soil measurement data acquired by a multireceiver electromagnetic induction geophysical system. We show, for the first time, how the similarity and joint spatial patterns between crop NDVI time series and soil electromagnetic induction information can be extracted in a statistically rigorous means, and the associated heterogeneity and correlation can be analyzed in a quantitative manner. Some preliminary results from this study improve our understanding the link of above surface crop performance with the heterogeneous subsurface. Additional investigations have been planned for further testing the validity and generalization of these findings. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian Analysis; Crop Performance; Electromagnetic Method; Heterogeneity; Machine Learning; Ndvi; Pattern Recognition; Precision Agriculture; Satellite Data; Soil-vegetation Interaction; Subsoil; Time Series; Topsoil","Bayesian analysis; crop performance; electromagnetic method; heterogeneity; machine learning; NDVI; pattern recognition; precision agriculture; satellite data; soil-vegetation interaction; subsoil; time series; topsoil","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the German Research Foundation (Transregional Collaborative Research Center 32—Patterns in Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Systems: Monitoring, Modeling and Data Assimilation), “TERrestrial Environmental Observatories” (TERENO), and Advanced Remote Sensing-Ground-Truth Demo and Test Facilities (ACROSS).

A comparison of the mass absorption coefficient of water-soluble BrC (b<inf>abs-WSBrC-365nm</inf>) in PM<inf>2.5</inf> with that in PM<inf>10</inf> sampled over the Bay of Bengal reveals the dominance of BrC in fine mode. Furthermore, the b<inf>abs-BrC-365nm</inf> shows a significant linear relationship with mass concentrations of airborne particulate matter, water-soluble organic carbon and non-sea-salt-K+ in the continental outflow from the IGP. This observation emphasizes the ubiquitous nature and significant contribution of water-soluble BrC from biomass burning emissions (BBEs). Comparing the absorption properties from this study with global datasets, it is discernible that BBEs dominate BrC absorption. Furthermore, the imaginary refractive index of water-soluble BrC (k<inf>WSBrC-365nm</inf>) in marine aerosols sampled over the North Indian Ocean during November is significantly higher than during December to January. Thus, significant temporal variability is associated with crop-residue burning emissions in the IGP on the composition of BrC over the North Indian Ocean. Our estimates show that the b<inf>abs-WSBrC-365nm</inf> and k<inf>WSBrC-365nm</inf> from post-harvest crop-residue burning emissions in the IGP are much higher than the BBEs from the southeastern United States and Amazonian forest fires. Another major finding of this study is the lack of significant relationship between k<inf>WSBrC-365nm</inf> and the mass ratio of elemental carbon to particulate organic matter, as previously suggested by chamber experiments to model varying BrC absorption properties in ambient aerosols. Therefore, considerable spatio-temporal variability prevails among emission sources (wood burning vs. crop-residue burning), which needs to be considered when assessing the regional radiative forcing of BrC relative to major absorbing elemental carbon. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Particulate Matter; Aerosols; Agricultural Wastes; Atmospheric Radiation; Barium Compounds; Crops; Deforestation; Oceanography; Organic Carbon; Particles (particulate Matter); Refractive Index; Water Absorption; Airborne Particulate Matters; Biomass Burning Emissions; Indo-gangetic Plains; Mass Absorption Coefficient; Particulate Organic Matters; Regional Radiative Forcing; Spatiotemporal Variability; Water-soluble Organic Carbon; Bromine Compounds; Brown Carbon; Organic Carbon; Unclassified Drug; Carbon; Absorption; Air Sampling; Airborne Particle; Article; Atmospheric Dispersion; Biomass; Chemical Composition; Exhaust Gas; Indian Ocean; Meteorology; Plant Residue; Priority Journal; Radiative Forcing; Refraction Index; Sea; Aerosol; Agriculture; Air Pollutant; Analysis; Asia; Crop; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Procedures; Wood; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Biomass; Carbon; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Wood","Aerosols; Agricultural wastes; Atmospheric radiation; Barium compounds; Crops; Deforestation; Oceanography; Organic carbon; Particles (particulate matter); Refractive index; Water absorption; Airborne particulate matters; Biomass burning emissions; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Mass absorption coefficient; Particulate organic matters; Regional radiative forcing; Spatiotemporal variability; Water-soluble organic carbon; Bromine compounds; brown carbon; organic carbon; unclassified drug; carbon; absorption; air sampling; airborne particle; Article; atmospheric dispersion; biomass; chemical composition; exhaust gas; Indian Ocean; meteorology; plant residue; priority journal; radiative forcing; refraction index; sea; aerosol; agriculture; air pollutant; analysis; Asia; crop; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; procedures; wood; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Biomass; Carbon; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Wood","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Particulate Matter","We acknowledge the funding support from the Indian Space Research Organization under Geosphere-Biosphere Programme for aerosol sampling and analysis of chemical composition.","Bond, Tami C., Light absorption by carbonaceous particles: An investigative review, Aerosol Science and Technology, 40, 1, pp. 27-67, (2006); Andreae, Meinrat O., Climate's dark forcings, Science, 340, 6130, pp. 280-281, (2013); Climate Change 2013 the Physical Science Basis, (2025); Andreae, Meinrat O., Black carbon or brown carbon? the nature of light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 6, 10, pp. 3131-3148, (2006); Bond, Tami C., Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific assessment, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 118, 11, pp. 5380-5552, (2013); Saleh, Rawad A., Contribution of brown carbon and lensing to the direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols from biomass and biofuel burning emissions, Journal of Geophysical Research, 120, 19, pp. 10285-10296, (2015); Feng, Yan, Brown carbon: A significant atmospheric absorber of solar radiation, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 13, 17, pp. 8607-8621, (2013); Lin, Guangxing, Radiative forcing of organic aerosol in the atmosphere and on snow: Effects of SOA and brown carbon, Journal of Geophysical Research, 119, 12, pp. 7453-7476, (2014); Wang, Xuan, Exploiting simultaneous observational constraints on mass and absorption to estimate the global direct radiative forcing of black carbon and brown carbon, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 14, 20, pp. 10989-11010, (2014); Wu, Guangming, Brown carbon in the cryosphere: Current knowledge and perspective, Advances in Climate Change Research, 7, 1-2, pp. 82-89, (2016)","","Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","20507887; 20507895","","","31089643","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067568092"

The existing historical LUCC datasets still have many uncertainties that cause errors in climate and environment simulations. Reconstruction of historical LUCC on the regional scale is essential for improving the precision of global and national LUCC. In this study, we combined existing datasets with historical statistics and survey data to reconstruct cropland change in North China Plain Area over the past 300 years. Following systematic steps, a range of original methods from data sources and methods comparison, data re-calibration, time slices selection, data supplement, to cropland area fraction calculation were used. The cropland area at the county level was allocated into grid cells of 10 km × 10 km so as to achieve a high spatial resolution and precision. The results show that the cropland area change in North China Plain Area can be classified into two main stages: steady increase before 1954 and rapid decrease after 1954. The spatial distribution of cropland change over the past 300 years corresponded to the patterns of the total cropland change in North China Plain Area. From the late 17th century to the 1980s, the cropland area fraction in the plains increased and the cropland expanded to the hilly and coastal areas gradually. After that, the cropland area fraction in the plains decreased, especially in the southeastern of North China Plain Area. The total cropland area in North China Plain Area of our study is close to the results of most previous studies but the maps generated based on our dataset present local difference of cropland distribution more clearly than a recent important global dataset HYDE3.2. Our dataset of cropland area at 10 km × 10 km grid scale can also be used directly in climate and environment simulations to improve the data precision in North China Plain Area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cropland Change; Integration; North China Plain Area; Past 300 years; Regional-scale Reconstruction; Climate Change; Integration; Land Use; Cropland Change; Environment Change; Environment Simulation; High Spatial Resolution; Land Use And Land Cover Change; North China Plain; Regional Climate; Regional Scale; Landforms; Agricultural Land; Coastal Zone; Data Assimilation; Data Set; Environmental Modeling; Hill; Historical Perspective; Historical Record; Integrated Approach; Land Use Change; Reconstruction; China","Climate change; Integration; Land use; Cropland change; Environment change; Environment simulation; High spatial resolution; Land use and land cover change; North China Plain; Regional climate; Regional scale; Landforms; agricultural land; coastal zone; data assimilation; data set; environmental modeling; hill; historical perspective; historical record; integrated approach; land use change; reconstruction; China","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by grants from the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFA0603304 ), National Science Foundation of China (No. 41471156 and 41807433 ), Basic Research Program ( Natural Science Foundation ) of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20180804 ) and Start-Up Foundation for Advanced Talents of Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology (No. 2243141501063 ).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by grants from the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFA0603304), National Science Foundation of China (No. 41471156 and 41807433), Basic Research Program (Natural Science Foundation) of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20180804) and Start-Up Foundation for Advanced Talents of Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology (No. 2243141501063).","Brovkin, Victor A., Role of land cover changes for atmospheric CO2 increase and climate change during the last 150 years, Global Change Biology, 10, 8, pp. 1253-1266, (2004); Cao, Xue, Reconstruction and change analysis of cropland data of China in recent 300 years, Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica, 69, 7, pp. 896-906, (2014); Datasets of Land and Resources of China, (1989); de Campos, Christiano Pires, Historical CO2 emission and concentrations due to land use change of croplands and pastures by country, Science of the Total Environment, 346, 1-3, pp. 149-155, (2005); Journal of Natural Resources, (2005); 13681953, (2008); History of Chinese Administrative Division the Republic of China, (2007); History of Administrative Divisions in China Qing Dynasty, (2013); Pages Magazine, (2015); Gaillard, Marie José, Holocene land-cover reconstructions for studies on land cover-climate feedbacks, Climate of the Past, 6, 4, pp. 483-499, (2010)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09218181","","GPCHE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062846579"

Satellite observations provide global data on spatiotemporal patterns of biomass burning and evidence for the rapid changes in global fire activity in response to land management and climate. Satellite imagery also provides detailed information on the daily or sub-daily position of fires that can be used to understand the dynamics of individual fires. The Global Fire Atlas is a new global dataset that tracks the dynamics of individual fires to determine the timing and location of ignitions, fire size and duration, and daily expansion, fire line length, speed, and direction of spread. Here, we present the underlying methodology and Global Fire Atlas results for 2003-2016 derived from daily moderate-resolution (500 m) Collection 6 MCD64A1 burned-area data. The algorithm identified 13.3 million individual fires over the study period, and estimated fire perimeters were in good agreement with independent data for the continental United States. A small number of large fires dominated sparsely populated arid and boreal ecosystems, while burned area in agricultural and other human-dominated landscapes was driven by high ignition densities that resulted in numerous smaller fires. Long-duration fires in boreal regions and natural landscapes in the humid tropics suggest that fire season length exerts a strong control on fire size and total burned area in these areas. In arid ecosystems with low fuel densities, high fire spread rates resulted in large, short-duration fires that quickly consumed available fuels. Importantly, multiday fires contributed the majority of burned area in all biomass burning regions. A first analysis of the largest, longest and fastest fires that occurred around the world revealed coherent regional patterns of extreme fires driven by large-scale climate forcing. Global Fire Atlas data are publicly available through http://www.globalfiredata.org (last access: 9 August 2018) and https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1642, and individual fire information and summary data products provide new information for benchmarking fire models within ecosystem and Earth system models, understanding vegetation-fire feedbacks, improving global emissions estimates, and characterizing the changing role of fire in the Earth system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Acknowledgements.

In the East Asian–Australasian Flyway (EAAF), however, the stopover ecology of migratory waterfowl is severely under-studied. The knowledge gaps regarding the timing, intensity and duration of stopover site usages prevent the development of effective and full annual cycle conservation strategies for migratory waterfowl in EAAF. In this study, we obtained a total of 33,493 relocations and visualized 33 completed spring migratory paths of five geese species using satellite tracking devices. We delineated 2,192,823 ha as the key stopover sites along the migration routes and found that croplands were the largest land use type within the stopover sites, followed by wetlands and natural grasslands (62.94%, 17.86% and 15.48% respectively). We further identified the conservation gaps by overlapping the stopover sites with the World Database on Protected Areas (PA). The results showed that only 15.63% (or 342,757 ha) of the stopover sites are covered by the current PA network. Our findings fulfil some key knowledge gaps for the conservation of the migratory waterbirds along the EAAF, thus enabling an integrative conservation strategy for migratory water birds in the flyway. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bohai Bay; Croplands; Migration Route; Northeast China Plains; Stopover; Utilization Distribution; Agricultural Land; Geographical Distribution; Migratory Species; Population Dynamics; Satellite Data; Stopover; Tracking; Waterfowl; Article; China; Cropland; Goose; Grassland; Nonhuman; Spring; Water Bird; Wetland; Animal; Environmental Protection; Geographic Information System; Population Migration; Season; Telecommunication; Bohai Bay; Anatidae; Anser; Aves; Animal Migration; Animals; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Geese; Geographic Information Systems; Grassland; Population Dynamics; Satellite Communications; Seasons; Wetlands","agricultural land; geographical distribution; migratory species; population dynamics; satellite data; stopover; tracking; waterfowl; article; China; cropland; goose; grassland; nonhuman; spring; water bird; wetland; animal; environmental protection; geographic information system; population migration; season; telecommunication; Bohai Bay; Anatidae; Anser; Aves; Animal Migration; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Geese; Geographic Information Systems; Grassland; Population Dynamics; Satellite Communications; Seasons; Wetlands","","","Funding: This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China No.41471072 and the National Key Research and Development Program of China No.2017YFC0405303.

In this context, building and updating a common map of the field is an essential but challenging task. The maps built using robots of different types show differences in size, resolution, and scale, the associated geolocation data may be inaccurate and biased while the repetitiveness of both visual appearance and geometric structures found within agricultural contexts render classical map merging techniques ineffective. In this letter, we propose AgriColMap, a novel map registration pipeline that leverages a grid-based multimodal environment representation, which includes a vegetation index map and a digital surface model. We cast the data association problem between maps built from UAVs and UGVs as a multimodal, large displacement dense optical flow estimation. The dominant, coherent flows, selected using a voting scheme, are used as point-to-point correspondences to infer a preliminary nonrigid alignment between the maps. A final refinement is then performed, by exploiting only meaningful parts of the registered maps. We evaluate our system using real-world data for three fields with different crop species. The results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art map registration and matching techniques by a large margin, and has a higher tolerance to large initial misalignments. We release an implementation of the proposed approach along with the acquired datasets with this letter. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Mapping; Multi-robot Systems; Robotics In Agriculture And Forestry; Forestry; Ground Vehicles; Mapping; Maps; Multipurpose Robots; Robotics; Surveys; Data Association Problem; Digital Surface Models; Environment Representations; Geometric Structure; Large Displacements; Matching Techniques; Multi-robot Systems; Unmanned Ground Vehicles; Antennas","Forestry; Ground vehicles; Mapping; Maps; Multipurpose robots; Robotics; Surveys; Data association problem; Digital surface models; Environment representations; Geometric structure; Large displacements; Matching techniques; Multi-robot systems; Unmanned ground vehicles; Antennas","","","","Kaslin, Roman, Collaborative localization of aerial and ground robots through elevation maps, pp. 284-290, (2016); Khanna, Raghav, Beyond point clouds - 3D mapping and field parameter measurements using UAVs, IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA, 2015-October, (2015); Howard, Andrew B., Multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping using particle filters, International Journal of Robotics Research, 25, 12, pp. 1243-1256, (2006); Gil, A., Multi-robot visual SLAM using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 58, 1, pp. 68-80, (2010); Birk, Andreas, Merging occupancy grid maps from multiple robots, Proceedings of the IEEE, 94, 7, pp. 1384-1397, (2006); Bonanni, Taigo Maria, 3-D Map Merging on Pose Graphs, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2, 2, pp. 1031-1038, (2017); Gawel, Abel, 3D registration of aerial and ground robots for disaster response: An evaluation of features, descriptors, and transformation estimation, pp. 27-34, (2017); Imperoli, Marco, An Effective Multi-Cue Positioning System for Agricultural Robotics, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 3, 4, pp. 3685-3692, (2018); Hu, Yinlin, Efficient coarse-to-fine patch match for large displacement optical flow, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016-December, pp. 5704-5712, (2016); Blanco-Claraco, José Luis, A robust, multi-hypothesis approach to matching occupancy grid maps, Robotica, 31, 5, pp. 687-701, (2013)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","23773766","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063311431"

In this paper, we focus on an agricultural robotics system that addresses the weeding problem by means of selective spraying or mechanical removal of the detected weeds. In particular, we describe a deep learning based method to allow a robot to perform an accurate weed/crop classification using a sequence of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to RGB images. The first network, based on an encoder-decoder segmentation architecture, performs a pixelwise, plant-type agnostic, segmentation between vegetation and soil that enables to extract a set of connected blobs representing plant instances. We show that such network can be trained also using external, ready to use pixel-wise labeled data sets coming from different contexts. Each plant is hence classified between crop and weeds by using the second network. Quantitative experimental results, obtained on real world data, demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve good classification results also on challenging images. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crop Weed Classification; Deep Learning; Precision Agriculture; Robot Vision; Computer Vision; Crops; Neural Networks; Pixels; Precision Agriculture; Robotics; Robots; Agricultural Robotics; Classification Results; Context Independent; Convolutional Neural Network; Encoder-decoder; High-tech Equipments; Labeled Data; Learning-based Methods; Deep Learning","Computer vision; Crops; Neural networks; Pixels; Precision agriculture; Robotics; Robots; Agricultural robotics; Classification results; Context independent; Convolutional neural network; Encoder-decoder; High-tech equipments; Labeled data; Learning-based methods; Deep learning","","","","Agricultural Robotics the Future of Robotic Agriculture, (2018); Lottes, Philipp, An effective classification system for separating sugar beets and weeds for precision farming applications, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2016-June, pp. 5157-5163, (2016); Milioto, Andres, Real-Time Semantic Segmentation of Crop and Weed for Precision Agriculture Robots Leveraging Background Knowledge in CNNs, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2229-2235, (2018); Lottes, Philipp, Fully convolutional networks with sequential information for robust crop and weed detection in precision farming, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 3, 4, pp. 2870-2877, (2018); Ronneberger, Olaf, U-net: Convolutional networks for biomedical image segmentation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9351, pp. 234-241, (2015); Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition, (2014); de Rainville, François Michel, Bayesian classification and unsupervised learning for isolating weeds in row crops, Pattern Analysis and Applications, 17, 2, pp. 401-414, (2014); Haug, Sebastian A., Plant classification system for crop /weed discrimination without segmentation, pp. 1142-1149, (2014); Lottes, Philipp, UAV-based crop and weed classification for smart farming, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 3024-3031, (2017); Lee, Sue Han, Deep-plant: Plant identification with convolutional neural networks, Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP, 2015-December, pp. 452-456, (2015)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd IEEE International Conference on Robotic Computing, IRC 2019","","Naples","146663","","9781538692455","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064117476"

It is necessary to conduct regional scale assessments of these global scenarios, identifying their uncertainties and pointing out directions for improvement. Based on the regional reconstruction Li-dataset, remotely sensed dataset, and grazing intensity dataset, the uncertainties of land use area and geographical distribution in HYDE3.1, HYDE3.2, and SAGE (a global land dataset from the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment) scenarios for the Qinghai–Tibet Area (QTA) are evaluated. The comparisons show that the cropland areas on the QTA in HYDE3.2 for 1900–2000 are close to those of the Li-dataset, whereas HYDE3.1 underestimated and SAGE overestimated the cropland areas significantly. Spatially, HYDE3.1, HYDE3.2, and SAGE have large uncertainties, which cannot reflect the distribution of cropland on the QTA and its changes for 1900–2000 well, and too much cropland is allocated to southeastern Tibet. HYDE3.1 and HYDE3.2 overestimated the pasture area and its distribution on the QTA significantly. The distribution of pasture in SAGE showed overall an agreement with the spatial pattern for grazing intensity, but changes in grazing intensity for 2000–2010 was not reflected in SAGE. The FAO pasture definition and estimates and the method of using population as a proxy for pasture area are not appropriate for the QTA. Methodology which uses the pasture inventory data to calibrate satellite-based grassland maps to obtain the current pasture maps may also not be appropriate because of the lacking differentiation between natural and anthropogenic grasslands in remotely sensed data. More regional level land use estimates with concise definitions, define the land use more clearly, and stratification reconstruction based on differences in agro-climatic conditions and resource endowments may be used to improve global maps. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Comparisons; Global Datasets; Grazing Intensity; Historical Land Use; Tibetan Plateau; Agriculture; Climate Change; Climate Models; Geographical Distribution; Remote Sensing; Sustainable Development; Climatic Conditions; Comparisons; Global Datasets; Grazing Intensity; Regional Reconstruction; Remotely Sensed Data; Resource Endowments; Tibetan Plateau; Land Use; Climate Change; Comparative Study; Data Set; Grazing; Historical Perspective; Land Use; Uncertainty Analysis; Article; Cropland; Differentiation; Geographic Distribution; Grassland; Human; Pasture; Stratification; Tibet; Uncertainty; China; Qinghai-xizang Plateau","Agriculture; Climate change; Climate models; Geographical distribution; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Climatic conditions; Comparisons; Global datasets; Grazing intensity; Regional reconstruction; Remotely sensed data; Resource endowments; Tibetan Plateau; Land use; climate change; comparative study; data set; grazing; historical perspective; land use; uncertainty analysis; article; cropland; differentiation; geographic distribution; grassland; human; pasture; stratification; Tibet; uncertainty; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau","","","We are grateful to three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve this study.

Efficient water management nowadays depends a lot upon simulation models. However, the availability of limited hydro-meteorological data together with limited data sharing practices prohibits simulation modelling and consequently efficient flood risk management of sparsely gauged basins. Advances in remote sensing has significantly contributed to carrying out hydrological studies in ungauged or sparsely gauged basins. In particular, the global datasets of remote sensing observations (e.g., rainfall, evaporation, temperature, land use, terrain, etc.) allow to develop hydrological and hydraulic models of sparsely gauged catchments. In this research, we have considered large scale hydrological and hydraulic modelling, using freely available global datasets, of the sparsely gauged trans-boundary Brahmaputra basin, which has an enormous potential in terms of agriculture, hydropower, water supplies and other utilities. A semi-distributed conceptual hydrological model was developed using HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Modelling System from Hydrologic Engineering Centre). Rainfall estimates from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) was compared with limited gauge data and used in the simulation. The Nash Sutcliffe coefficient of the model with the uncorrected rainfall data in calibration and validation were 0.75 and 0.61 respectively whereas the similar values with the corrected rainfall data were 0.81 and 0.74. The output of the hydrological model was used as a boundary condition and lateral inflow to the hydraulic model. Modelling results obtained using uncorrected and corrected remotely sensed products of rainfall were compared with the discharge values at the basin outlet (Bahadurabad) and with altimetry data from Jason-2 satellite. The simulated flood inundation maps of the lower part of the Brahmaputra basin showed reasonably good match in terms of the probability of detection, success ratio and critical success index. Overall, this study demonstrated that reliable and robust results can be obtained in both hydrological and hydraulic modelling using remote sensing data as the only input to large scale and sparsely gauged basins. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brahmaputra; Flood Mapping; Hydraulic Modelling; Hydrological Modelling; Remote Sensing; Trmm; Catchments; Climate Models; Flood Control; Floods; Geodetic Satellites; Hydraulic Models; Land Use; Large Dataset; Mapping; Rain; Rain Gages; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Water Conservation; Water Management; Water Supply; Brahmaputra; Calibration And Validations; Flood Mapping; Hydrological Modelling; Nash-sutcliffe Coefficient; Sustainable Water Management; Trmm; Tropical Rainfall Measuring Missions; Remote Sensing","Catchments; Climate models; Flood control; Floods; Geodetic satellites; Hydraulic models; Land use; Large dataset; Mapping; Rain; Rain gages; Risk assessment; Risk management; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Brahmaputra; Calibration and validations; Flood mapping; Hydrological modelling; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; Sustainable water management; TRMM; Tropical rainfall measuring missions; Remote sensing","","","","Kummerow, Christian D., The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) sensor package, Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 15, 3, pp. 809-817, (1998); Huffman, George J., The TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA): Quasi-global, multiyear, combined-sensor precipitation estimates at fine scales, Journal of Hydrometeorology, 8, 1, pp. 38-55, (2007); Prasetia, Rakhmat, Validation of TRMM Precipitation Radar satellite data over Indonesian region, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 112, 3-4, pp. 575-587, (2013); Kneis, David, Evaluation of TRMM rainfall estimates over a large Indian river basin (Mahanadi), Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 18, 7, pp. 2493-2502, (2014); Peng, Bin, Evaluation of TRMM multisatellite precipitation analysis (tmpa) products and their potential hydrological application at an arid and semiarid basin in china, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 7, 9, pp. 3915-3930, (2014); Yong, B., Intercomparison of the Version-6 and Version-7 TMPA precipitation products over high and low latitudes basins with independent gauge networks: Is the newer version better in both real-time and post-real-time analysis for water resources and hydrologic extremes?, Journal of Hydrology, 508, pp. 77-87, (2014); Cai, Yancong, Spatio-temporal analysis of the accuracy of tropical multisatellite precipitation analysis 3b42 precipitation data in mid-high latitudes of China, PLOS ONE, 10, 4, (2015); Chen, Sheng, Hydrologic Evaluation of the TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis over Ganjiang Basin in Humid Southeastern China, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 8, 9, pp. 4568-4580, (2015); Cai, Yancong, Comprehensive precipitation evaluation of TRMM 3B42 with dense rain gauge networks in a mid-latitude basin, northeast, China, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 126, 3-4, pp. 659-671, (2016); Kumar, Dheeraj, Evaluation of TRMM multi-satellite precipitation analysis (TMPA) against terrestrial measurement over a humid sub-tropical basin, India, Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 129, 3-4, pp. 783-799, (2017)","","MDPI AG indexing@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","20724292","9780891814184; 0891814183; 9780123694072","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063012749"

Olive (Olea europaea L.) is a global, high value crop currently cultivated in 28 countries worldwide. Global data to assess the vulnerability of the crop to climate variability are scarce, and in some notable cases, such the United Nations Food and Agricutlure Organization database (FAO, 2006), qualitative assessments rather than quantitative indicators are provided. The aim of this study is to demonstrate a new approach to help overcome these constraints toward a globally applicable method to assess the adaptability of olive cultivars. The adaptability of 11 cultivars, widely used in 11 countries worldwide, was studied using a new generic approach based on the evaluation of soil hydrological regime against cultivar-specific hydrological requirements. The approach requires local data, notably on soil hydrological properties, but it is easily transferable to other countries and regions. We applied an agrohydrological model in 60 soil units to determine hydrological indicators both in a reference (1961–1990) and a future (2021–2050) climate case. We compared indicators with cultivar-specific requirements to achieve the target yield; requirements were established using experimental yield response curves. We estimated the probability of adaptation, i.e., the probability that a given cultivar attains the target yield, and we used it to evaluate the cultivar potential distribution in the study area. At the locations where soil hydrological conditions were favorable, the probabilities of adaptation of the cultivars were high in both climate cases. The results show that the area with suitable conditions for the target yield (area of adaptability) decreased under future climate for all the cultivars, with higher reduction for Frantoio and Maiatica and smaller reduction for Itrana, Nocellara, Ascolana, and Kalamata. These cultivars are currently grown in Argentina, United States (US), Australia, France, Greece, and Italy. Our results indicate also that these cultivars require higher available soil water to attain the target yield, i.e., we may expect similar vulnerability in other parts of the world. Based on these findings, we provide some specific recommendations for enrichment of global databases and for further developments of our approach, to increase its potential for global application. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation; Agro-hydrological Model; Climate Change; Olea Europaea L; Yield Response Curves; Adaptation; Climate Change; Crop Plant; Cultivar; Evergreen Tree; Future Prospect; Hydrological Modeling; Hydrological Regime; Mediterranean Environment; Soil Property; Vulnerability; Water Availability; Yield Response; Argentina; Australia; France; Greece; Italy; United States; Olea Europaea","adaptation; climate change; crop plant; cultivar; evergreen tree; future prospect; hydrological modeling; hydrological regime; Mediterranean environment; soil property; vulnerability; water availability; yield response; Argentina; Australia; France; Greece; Italy; United States; Olea europaea","","","Funding text 1: The climatic datasets were produced by the Agenzia Regionale Prevenzione e Ambiente (Arpae – Emilia Romagna) and by the “Research Unit for Climatology and Meteorology applied to Agriculture” (CREA-CMA ) within the project AGROSCENARI.

Brown School of Engineering and Computing, Houston, United States","Soils are important sources of emissions of nitrogen-containing (N-containing) gases such as nitric oxide (NO), nitrous acid (HONO), nitrous oxide (N <inf>2</inf> O), and ammonia (NH <inf>3</inf> ). However, most contemporary air quality models lack a mechanistic representation of the biogeochemical processes that form these gases. They typically use heavily parameterized equations to simulate emissions of NO independently from NH <inf>3</inf> and do not quantify emissions of HONO or N <inf>2</inf> O. This study introduces a mechanistic, process-oriented representation of soil emissions of N species (NO, HONO, N <inf>2</inf> O, and NH <inf>3</inf> ) that we have recently implemented in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The mechanistic scheme accounts for biogeochemical processes for soil N transformations such as mineralization, volatilization, nitrification, and denitrification. The rates of these processes are influenced by soil parameters, meteorology, land use, and mineral N availability. We account for spatial heterogeneity in soil conditions and biome types by using a global dataset for soil carbon (C) and N across terrestrial ecosystems to estimate daily mineral N availability in nonagricultural soils, which was not accounted for in earlier parameterizations for soil NO. Our mechanistic scheme also uses daily year-specific fertilizer use estimates from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC v0509) agricultural model. A soil map with sub-grid biome definitions was used to represent conditions over the continental United States. CMAQ modeling for May and July 2011 shows improvement in model performance in simulated NO <inf>2</inf> columns compared to Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite retrievals for regions where soils are the dominant source of NO emissions. We also assess how the new scheme affects model performance for NO <inf>x</inf> (NO+NO <inf>2</inf> ), fine nitrate (NO <inf>3</inf> ) particulate matter, and ozone observed by various ground-based monitoring networks. Soil NO emissions in the new mechanistic scheme tend to fall between the magnitudes of the previous parametric schemes and display much more spatial heterogeneity. The new mechanistic scheme also accounts for soil HONO, which had been ignored by parametric schemes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Quality; Ammonia; Atmospheric Modeling; Biogeochemical Cycle; Biome; Biotransformation; Fertilizer Application; Heterogeneity; Nitrous Acid; Nitrous Oxide; Nutrient Availability; Ozone; Soil Emission; Soil Nitrogen; United States","air quality; ammonia; atmospheric modeling; biogeochemical cycle; biome; biotransformation; fertilizer application; heterogeneity; nitrous acid; nitrous oxide; nutrient availability; ozone; soil emission; soil nitrogen; United States","","","Acknowledgements.

In this study, we address some of these challenges by applying the TIN‐based Real‐time Integrated Basin Simulator DHM at a nominal resolution of ~88 m in the Río Sonora basin, a regional watershed of ~21,000 km2 in northwest Mexico. First, we generate reliable high‐resolution (1‐km) hydrometeorological forcings by bias correcting reanalysis products with ground observations and applying downscaling routines that use terrain information at high resolution, which is available globally. Second, we develop a strategy to obtain high‐resolution (250‐m) grids of soil parameters by integrating a coarse‐resolution soil map based on the Food and Agriculture Organization classification with recently released high‐resolution global data sets. Third, we apply the model over a decadal period (2004–2013) and use a set of complementary tools, including Taylor diagrams, connectivity analysis, and empirical orthogonal function analysis, to assess its ability to simulate spatial patterns of land surface temperature through comparison with daily remotely sensed products. We find that (i) the hyperresolution‐simulated patterns capture the spatial variability of land surface temperature quite well and (ii) vegetation properties are the major physical factors controlling the discrepancies between simulated and remotely sensed products. The strategies presented here are based on global data sets and robust statistical techniques that can be utilized in different settings with other DHMs, and thus, they provide valuable support for the scientific community focused on hyperresolution hydrologic modeling. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric Temperature; Classification (of Information); Land Surface Temperature; Orthogonal Functions; Remote Sensing; Surface Measurement; Analyse Of Spatial Pattern; Distributed Hydrologic Modeling; Global Data Sets; High Resolution; Hydrologic Models; Hyper-resolution; Hyperresolution Hydrologic Modeling; Physics-based; Spatial Patterns; Surface Properties","Atmospheric temperature; Classification (of information); Land surface temperature; Orthogonal functions; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Analyse of spatial pattern; Distributed hydrologic modeling; Global data sets; High resolution; Hydrologic models; Hyper-resolution; Hyperresolution hydrologic modeling; Physics-based; Spatial patterns; Surface properties","","","We thank the Associate Editor, two anonymous reviewers, and Ethan Coon for their comments that helped improve the quality of the manuscript.

Despite much attention paid to synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer and manure N applications to croplands, spatially explicit, continuous time-series datasets of manure and fertilizer N inputs on pastures and rangelands are lacking. We developed three global gridded datasets at a resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° for the period 1860-2016 (i.e., annual manure N deposition (by grazing animals) rate, synthetic N fertilizer and N manure application rates), by combining annual and 5 arcmin spatial data on pastures and rangelands with country-level statistics on livestock manure, mineral and chemical fertilizers, and land use information for cropland and permanent meadows and pastures. Based on the new data products, we estimated that total N inputs, the sum of manure N deposition, manure N application and fertilizer N application to pastures and rangelands, increased globally from 15 to 101 Tg N yr-1 during 1860-2016. In particular during the period 2000-2016, livestock manure N deposition accounted for 83 % of the total N inputs, whereas manure and fertilizer N application accounted 9 % and 8 %, respectively. At the regional scale, hotspots of manure N deposition remained largely similar during the period 1860-2016 (i.e., southern Asia, Africa and South America); however, hotspots of manure and fertilizer N application shifted from Europe to southern Asia in the early 21st century. The new three global datasets contribute to the filling of the previous data gaps of global and regional N inputs in pastures and rangelands, improving the abilities of ecosystem and earth system models to investigate the global impacts of N enrichment due to agriculture, in terms of associated greenhouse gas emissions and environmental sustainability issues.

Evidence shows that natural resources affect the fighting capacity of rebel groups; yet, by focusing on lucrative resources that are rare in most rebellion-afflicted countries, such as oil and diamonds, scholars neglected one necessary input for rebellion: staple crops. Focusing on maize, the world’s most prevalent staple, this study argues that, as one of the most important resources for rebel groups, maize can have a destabilizing effect on the state’s ability to thwart rebellion. These claims are corroborated statistically on a new time-varying, high-resolution global dataset of staple crop productivity, and then qualitatively through an analysis of archival records on the Mau Mau rebellion. In identifying an overlooked, global linkage between agricultural abundance, state capacity, and intrastate violence, this study explains strong geographical and temporal variations in rebellions at both the subnational and global levels. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Civil War; Environmental Conflict; Food Security; Rebellion; State Capacity","","","","This article was partly supported by a Jennings Randolph Peace Scholar Award from the United States Institute of Peace.

Here we present three complete pollination networks, along a secondary successional gradient, in critically endangered Renosterveld vegetation within an agri-environment, South Africa. Site selection was based on historical land-use and contemporary vegetation data resulting in a pristine site, a late successional site where agriculture was halted >15 years ago, and an early successional site where agriculture was halted <five years ago. In total, 240 hours of pollinator-plant observations were recorded over a single flowering season. The pristine site was highly specialised in comparison to global datasets - most likely as a result of relative climatic stability through the Quaternary which allowed specialisation to manifest and persist. Both non-pristine sites showed noticeable differences in characteristics when expressed through network indices; however, the early successional site was closer in nature to the pristine site as a result of vegetation structure. Notwithstanding a lack of replication across the successional gradient precluding robust statistical analyses, this study provides important data which allows for the comparison of pollination dynamics in an understudied and vulnerable vegetation type, to plant-pollinator networks at the global and regional scale. In addition, apparent changes to network indices as a result of habitat alteration, suggest that successional trajectory plays an important role in pollination dynamics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agri-ecosystems; Ecosystem Functioning; Food-webs; Pollination; Specialization","","","","","Albrecht, Matthias, Plant-pollinator network assembly along the chronosequence of a glacier foreland, Oikos, 119, 10, pp. 1610-1624, (2010); Almeida-Neto, Mário, A straightforward computational approach for measuring nestedness using quantitative matrices, Environmental Modelling and Software, 26, 2, pp. 173-178, (2011); Arnold, Sarah E.J., Flower color phenology in European grassland and woodland habitats, through the eyes of pollinators, Israel Journal of Plant Sciences, 57, 3, pp. 211-230, (2009); Bartomeus, Ignasi, Contrasting effects of invasive plants in plant-pollinator networks, Oecologia, 155, 4, pp. 761-770, (2008); Bascompte, Jordi, Mutualistic networks, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 7, 8, pp. 429-436, (2009); Bascompte, Jordi, Asymmetric coevolutionary networks facilitate biodiversity maintenance, Science, 312, 5772, pp. 431-433, (2006); Fynbos Ecology Evolution and Conservation of A Megadiverse Region, (2014); Blüthgen, Nico, Why network analysis is often disconnected from community ecology: A critique and an ecologist's guide, Basic and Applied Ecology, 11, 3, pp. 185-195, (2010); Blüthgen, Nico, Measuring specialization in species interaction networks, BMC Ecology and Evolution, 6, (2006); Blüthgen, Nico, What do interaction network metrics tell us about specialization and biological traits?, Ecology, 89, 12, pp. 3387-3399, (2008)","","Enviroquest Ltd","","","","","","19207603","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117139101"

The detection of diseases in plants using deep image approaches is attracting researchers as a way of taking advantage of cutting-edge learning techniques in scenarios where major benefits can be achieved for mankind. In this work, we focus on diseases of three major different agricultural crops: apple, peach and tomato. Using a real-world dataset composed of nearly 24,000 images, including healthy examples, we propose a hierarchical deep learning approach for plant disease detection and compare it with the standard deep learning approaches.

Relatively simple and accurate estimation methods, which use only daily air temperature together with precipitation, are often required. Based on all available solar radiation data across Canada, the most common and representative solar radiation models were evaluated. All estimation models provided more accurate estimates, in terms of all performance statistics used in this study, than those extracted directly from a high-resolution global dataset of meteorological forcings for land surface modelling. The DS model adapted from one originally developed for the Canadian Prairies performed better than other representative models for all stations. The DS model was then adapted for regional use in southern Canada, mostly the major agricultural regions. We compared simulated crop yields using the CSM–CERES–wheat and CSM–CROPGRO–canola models driven by observed and estimated daily solar radiation data, and we found a difference of approximately 5% for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and 12% for canola (Brassica napus L.). Based on the results for two locations under different climate regimes with relatively long records (45 and 40 yr, respectively) of solar radiation data, the models using daily temperature range and precipitation were found to be robust for daily solar radiation estimation for the entire time periods of the data records. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crop Modelling; Estimation Methods; Global Solar Radiation; Regional Application; Temporal Robustness; Agricultural Land; Agricultural Modeling; Agrometeorology; Air Temperature; Data Set; Estimation Method; Land Surface; Solar Radiation; Prairie Provinces; Brassica Napus; Brassica Napus Var.

The new map layers were developed using airborne gamma radiation data, a laser-scanned digital elevation model, legacy Quaternary deposit maps and a national soil sample database. In addition, an interactive and automated functionality for downscaling was developed in a freely available decision support system (DSS; Markdata.se) to enable use of the new map layers for within-field variable-rate liming for soil pH correction.

Marginal populations of amphibians in Latvia and Ukraine are particularly vulnerable. On the other hand, several studies have shown a positive relationship between human density and biodiversity, indicating that species-rich areas and human enterprises quite often co-occur. Therefore, both positive and negative correlations between human population and species richness may be expected. For a better understanding of what constitutes suitable habitat we used a habitat modeling approach, where modeling can be used for revealing species ecological requirements and relationships between the distribution of species and predictive variables, as well as the importance of each variable in model building. Here we employed maximum entropy (MaxEnt) niche modeling, as a tool to assess potential habitat suitability (HS) for amphibians in Europe, making special emphasis on anthropogenic impact. We used 2474 georeferenced point data (783-B. bombina occurrence, and to compare results 1691-L. vulgaris), including results of our field investigations in Latvia and Ukraine. The predictor variables used for modelling the toad species HS suitability were of climate derived from the WorldClim database (19 bioclimatic variables). Human impact was assessed by the Human Footprint (HF), produced through an overlay of a number of global data layers that represent the location of various factors presumed to exert an influence on ecosystems: human population distribution, urban areas, roads, navigable rivers, and various agricultural land uses. Using the Spearman rank correlation, a low, however statistically significant positive correlation (p<0.05), was found between the predicted HS and the HF. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bombina Bombina; Human Footprint (hf); Niche Modeling (maxent); Biodiversity; Cell Proliferation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land Use; Population Dynamics; Population Statistics; Agricultural Land Use; Anthropogenic Impacts; Bombina Bombina; Ecological Requirements; Human Footprints; Niche Modeling (maxent); Positive Correlations; Spearman Rank Correlation; Population Distribution","Biodiversity; Cell proliferation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Agricultural land use; Anthropogenic impacts; Bombina bombina; Ecological requirements; Human footprints; Niche modeling (MaxEnt); Positive correlations; Spearman rank correlation; Population distribution","","","The study was conducted in accordance with legislation of Latvia and Ukraine.

Robots have the potential to treat every plant in the field individually and thus can reduce the required use of such chemicals. To achieve that, robots need the ability to identify crops and weeds in the field and must additionally select effective treatments. While certain types of weed can be treated mechanically, other types need to be treated by (selective) spraying. In this paper, we present an approach that provides the necessary information for effective plant-specific treatment. It outputs the stem location for weeds, which allows for mechanical treatments, and the covered area of the weed for selective spraying. Our approach uses an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates stem positions as well as the covered area of crops and weeds. It jointly learns the class-wise stem detection and the pixel-wise semantic segmentation. Experimental evaluations on different real-world datasets show that our approach is able to reliably solve this problem. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach not only substantially improves the stem detection accuracy, i.e., distinguishing crop and weed stems, but also provides an improvement in the semantic segmentation performance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Chemicals; Crops; Cultivation; Semantics; Weed Control; Convolutional Networks; Detection Accuracy; Experimental Evaluation; Mechanical Treatments; Precision Farming; Real-world Datasets; Semantic Segmentation; State-of-the-art Approach; Intelligent Robots","Agricultural chemicals; Crops; Cultivation; Semantics; Weed control; Convolutional networks; Detection accuracy; Experimental evaluation; Mechanical treatments; Precision farming; Real-world datasets; Semantic segmentation; State-of-the-art approach; Intelligent robots","","","","Badrinarayanan, Vijay, SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39, 12, pp. 2481-2495, (2017); Chebrolu, Nived, Agricultural robot dataset for plant classification, localization and mapping on sugar beet fields, International Journal of Robotics Research, 36, 10, pp. 1045-1052, (2017); A Guide to Convolution Arithmetic for Deep Learning, (2016); Everingham, Mark, The pascal visual object classes (VOC) challenge, International Journal of Computer Vision, 88, 2, pp. 303-338, (2010); Workshop Proc of Conf on Intelligent Autonomous Systems IAS, (2014); Haug, Sebastian A., Plant classification system for crop /weed discrimination without segmentation, pp. 1142-1149, (2014); He, Kaiming, Delving deep into rectifiers: Surpassing human-level performance on imagenet classification, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015 International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2015, pp. 1026-1034, (2015); Huang, Gao, Densely connected convolutional networks, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017-January, pp. 2261-2269, (2017); One Hundred Layers Tiramisu Fully Convolutional Densenets for Semantic Segmentation, (2016); Kiani, Sajad, Crop detection and positioning in the field using discriminant analysis and neural networks based on shape features, Journal of Agricultural Science and Technology, 14, 4, pp. 755-765, (2012)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Bosch; et al.; JD.Com; Kuka; PAL Robotics; Santander","2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS 2018","","Madrid; Madrid Municipal Conference Centre","144267","21530866; 21530858","9781538680940; 9781665479271; 9781424402595; 9781728162126; 9781467317375; 0780319338; 1424409128; 9781665417143; 9781479999941; 0780308239","85RBA","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063006156"

Previous studies have shown the relationship between our eating habits and each of these three topics independently. Here we analyzed the links between health, agricultural production and environmental data together, using global databases. We found the Western diet—dominated by processed foods, refined sugar, fats and flours—has negative implications for all three. Increased production and consumption of sugar and refined grains over the last 40 years correlates with negative human health outcomes globally: an alarming increase in diseases such as diabetes, overweight and obesity. In addition to these health effects, the Western diet relies on methods of agricultural production that negatively impact ecosystems, increase the use of fossil fuels and boost greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe). Ancestral communities around the world consume a greater variety of plant and animal species (including insects) than Western urban populations, with positive health and environmental outcomes. Processed food, on the other hand, comes at a high environmental cost: it generates high GHGe, accelerates land-use change to support agriculture and intensive livestock activities, and requires huge amounts of water and agrochemicals. Changing the Western diet could substantially reduce diabetes, obesity, and GHGe.

One significant modern challenge is developing low cost, accurate approaches to predict available soil P that are useful to scientists around the world. We conducted a global meta-analysis using data on available soil P from 738 sites, 640 in the USA and 149 in 14 other countries. Four different methods of determining available soil P, New Zealand (NZ), acid oxalate, Bray and Mehlich 3 were represented in the dataset. Inputs evaluated for inclusion in the pedotransfer functions to predict available soil P were clay (C), fine silt, (FSi) coarse silt (CSi), very fine sand (VFS), fine sand (FS), medium sand (MS), coarse sand (CS), very coarse sand (VCS), organic carbon (OC), pH, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and manganese (Mn). Available soil P was estimated for: 1) the entire dataset, 2) only the USA, and 3) the non-USA dataset. The best models to estimate available soil P were obtained for the NZ method (using the co-variates C, FSi, CSi, VFS, MS, CS, OC, Fe, Al, Mn, Ca, Mg, and pH) and for the acid oxalate method (using the co-variates C, FSi, Fe, Al, Mn, Ca, and Mg). Although estimation of available soil P determined with the acid oxalate method was poor for the entire dataset, good estimates were obtained for the USA and non-USA datasets separately. Models for the Bray and Mehlich 3 methods only predicted available soil P well for the non-USA dataset. Using pedotransfer function models to estimate available soil P could provide an efficient and cost effective way to estimate global distributions of a soil property that is important for a number of agricultural and environmental reasons. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic Algorithm; Simulation; Soil Properties; Statistical Models; Aluminum; Calcium; Iron; Magnesium; Malachite Green; Manganese; Phosphorus; Potassium; Cost Effectiveness; Cost Estimating; Genetic Algorithms; Hydraulic Conductivity; Organic Carbon; Oxalic Acid; Phosphorus; Sand; Silicon Compounds; Silt; Environmental Reasons; Global Distribution; Pedo-transfer Functions; Simulation; Soil Phosphorous; Soil Phosphorus; Soil Property; Very Fine Sands; Cost Benefit Analysis; Aluminum; Calcium; Iron; Magnesium; Malachite Green; Manganese; Organic Carbon; Phosphorus; Potassium; Computer Simulation; Genetic Algorithm; Meta-analysis; Numerical Model; Pedotransfer Function; Soil Chemistry; Soil Property; Statistical Analysis; Article; Data Base; Geographic Distribution; New Zealand; Nonlinear System; Nutrient Availability; Ph; Priority Journal; Sand; Silt; Soil; Soil Analysis; Statistical Model; United States","Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Genetic algorithms; Hydraulic conductivity; Organic carbon; Oxalic acid; Phosphorus; Sand; Silicon compounds; Silt; Environmental reasons; Global distribution; Pedo-transfer functions; Simulation; Soil phosphorous; Soil phosphorus; Soil property; Very fine sands; Cost benefit analysis; aluminum; calcium; iron; magnesium; malachite green; manganese; organic carbon; phosphorus; potassium; computer simulation; genetic algorithm; meta-analysis; numerical model; pedotransfer function; soil chemistry; soil property; statistical analysis; Article; data base; geographic distribution; New Zealand; nonlinear system; nutrient availability; pH; priority journal; sand; silt; soil; soil analysis; statistical model; United States","","aluminum, 7429-90-5; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; magnesium, 7439-95-4; malachite green, 569-64-2; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; potassium, 7440-09-7","","Achat, David Ludovick, Predicting available phosphate ions from physical-chemical soil properties in acidic sandy soils under pine forests, Journal of Soils and Sediments, 11, 3, pp. 452-466, (2011); Beauchemin, Suzanne, Speciation of phosphorus in phosphorus-enriched agricultural soils using X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy and chemical fractionation, Journal of Environmental Quality, 32, 5, pp. 1809-1819, (2003); Borda, Teresa, Predicting mobilization of suspended sediments and phosphorus from soil properties: A case study from the north west Po valley, Piemonte, Italy, Soil Use and Management, 26, 3, pp. 310-319, (2010); Dissolution and Adsorption Properties of Soil Iron Oxides, (1990); Soil Chemistry in A Pedological Context, (2002); Borggaard, Ole Kragholm, Estimation of soil phosphate adsorption capacity by means of a pedotransfer function, Geoderma, 118, 1-2, pp. 55-61, (2004); Bryant, Ray B., Perspectives on the potential for hydropedology to improve watershed modeling of phosphorus loss, Geoderma, 131, 3-4, pp. 299-307, (2006); Cagliari, J., Remaining phosphorus estimated by pedotransfer function, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo, 35, 1, pp. 203-212, (2011); Carpenter, Stephen R., Phosphorus control is critical to mitigating eutrophication, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 105, 32, pp. 11039-11040, (2008); Cieniawski, Scott E., Using Genetic Algorithms to Solve a Multiobjective Groundwater Monitoring Problem, Water Resources Research, 31, 2, pp. 399-409, (1995)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00489697; 18791026","","STEVA","30743824","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049573333"

However, not all species are adversely affected by land use, and indeed, some benefit from the creation of novel habitat. Geographically rare species may be more negatively affected by land use than widespread species, but data limitations have so far prevented global multi-clade assessments of land-use effects on narrow-ranged and widespread species. We analyse a large, global database to show consistent differences in assemblage composition. Compared with natural habitat, assemblages in disturbed habitats have more widespread species on average, especially in urban areas and the tropics. All else being equal, this result means that human land use is homogenizing assemblage composition across space. Disturbed habitats show both reduced abundances of narrow-ranged species and increased abundances of widespread species. Our results are very important for biodiversity conservation because narrow-ranged species are typically at higher risk of extinction than widespread species. Furthermore, the shift to more widespread species may also affect ecosystem functioning by reducing both the contribution of rare species and the diversity of species’ responses to environmental changes among local assemblages. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Conservation Biology; Environmental Change; Habitat; Human; Nonhuman; Rare Species; Tropics; Urban Area; Agriculture; Animal; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Environmental Protection; Natural Resource; Procedures; Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Natural Resources","article; conservation biology; environmental change; habitat; human; nonhuman; rare species; tropics; urban area; agriculture; animal; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; natural resource; procedures; Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Natural Resources","","","","Barnosky, Anthony D., Has the Earth's sixth mass extinction already arrived?, Nature, 471, 7336, pp. 51-57, (2011); Ceballos, Gerardo, Accelerated modern human-induced species losses: Entering the sixth mass extinction, Science Advances, 1, 5, (2015); Crutzen, Paul Jozef, Geology of mankind, Nature, 415, 6867, (2002); Maxwell, Sean L., Biodiversity: The ravages of guns, nets and bulldozers, Nature, 536, 7615, pp. 143-145, (2016); Newbold, Tim, Global effects of land use on local terrestrial biodiversity, Nature, 520, 7545, pp. 45-50, (2015); Thomas, Chris D., Local diversity stays about the same, regional diversity increases, and global diversity declines, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110, 48, pp. 19187-19188, (2013); Newbold, Tim, Global patterns of terrestrial assemblage turnover within and among land uses, Ecography, 39, 12, pp. 1151-1163, (2016); Collen, Ben, Clarifying misconceptions of extinction risk assessment with the IUCN Red List, Biology Letters, 12, 4, (2016); Purvis, Andy, Predicting extinction risk in declining species, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 267, 1456, pp. 1947-1952, (2000); Ripple, William J., Extinction risk is most acute for the world’s largest and smallest vertebrates, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 114, 40, pp. 10678-10683, (2017)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","15449173; 15457885","","PBLIB","30513079","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058901012"

The recent greening of global lands suggests an increasing trend of terrestrial vegetation growth, but whether or not the peak growth has been globally enhanced still remains unclear. Here, we use two global datasets of gross primary productivity (GPP) and a satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to characterize recent changes in annual peak vegetation growth (that is, GPP <inf>max</inf> and NDVI <inf>max</inf> ). We demonstrate that the peak in the growth of global vegetation has been linearly increasing during the past three decades. About 65% of the NDVI <inf>max</inf> variation is evenly explained by expanding croplands (21%), rising CO <inf>2</inf> (22%) and intensifying nitrogen deposition (22%). The contribution of expanding croplands to the peak growth trend is substantiated by measurements from eddy-flux towers, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and a global database of plant traits, all of which demonstrate that croplands have a higher photosynthetic capacity than other vegetation types. The large contribution of CO <inf>2</inf> is also supported by a meta-analysis of 466 manipulative experiments and 15 terrestrial biosphere models. Furthermore, we show that the contribution of GPP <inf>max</inf> to the change in annual GPP is less in the tropics than in other regions. These multiple lines of evidence reveal an increasing trend in the peak growth of global vegetation. The findings highlight the important roles of agricultural intensification and atmospheric changes in reshaping the seasonality of global vegetation growth. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Plant Development; Remote Sensing; Season; Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Plant Development; Remote Sensing Technology; Seasons","ecosystem; photosynthesis; plant development; remote sensing; season; Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Plant Development; Remote Sensing Technology; Seasons","","","This work was financially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFA0604603), National Natural Science Foundation (31430015, 41601099 and 41630528) and National 1000 Young Talents Program of China.

A first and critical important step in the implementation of LDN is assessing the current land condition using not only active restoration of degraded land, but also targeting land degradation drivers behind the land degradation process. In a first step to achieve these goals, countries were provided a global dataset for three sub-indicators of land degradation: land cover (LC), land productivity dynamics (LPD) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we report on trends in these sub-indicators for the Entity Republic of Srpska (RS) as a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a key analysis to inform the frame of reference or baseline conditions for the region to evaluate LDN across this region. Global data for LC for the RS indicates a 0.5% loss of forests (6400 ha) over the time period from 2000 to 2010. Of this area, 5000 ha were converted to cropland and an additional 1400 ha was converted to shrubs, grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas. LPD declined over 2.5% (63,500 ha) of the region. SOC declined on land use changed areas by 15.6% (74,609 Mg ha−1) over the same time period. Based on global data, we estimated that 3% of the country is in a degraded state. Based on interviews with local stakeholders in 31 local communities, the primary land degradation drivers were identified and validated by team experts. Depopulation and migration to urban centers were identified as the important underlying drivers of land degradation that most municipalities are facing. The most frequent direct drivers of land degradation across this region were land abandonment, floods, drought, erosion and urbanization. Land abandonment, more specifically, has resulted in conversion of agriculturally productive lands to lands dominated by a wide range of invasive species over the last 25 years. Continued land degradation is underpinned by the lack of understanding by stakeholders of the importance of land as a resource.

In ecology the trend is averaged by taking monocultures of all species as baseline to evaluate mixtures. This contrasts the “agricultural” view focusing on the most productive species or species combination as baseline to evaluate mixtures. The present study investigates the change of highest rates (maximum) productivities in grasslands and forests with increasing plant (or tree) diversity, and compares these with the average response. Methods: We base our analysis on existing published datasets relating the growth of plant stands (growth rate per land area) to the diversity on the same plot. We use a global dataset (Ellis et al. 2012 and MODIS-data, see Fig. 1), the grassland experiment in Jena (Buchmann et al. 2017), the regional study on forests in Romania and Germany by Bouriaud et al. (2016), and data from the German National Forest inventory (BWI 3, see Fig. 3). In all cases the average response of growth to changes in biodiversity as well as the boundary line of the maximum values was calculated. Results: In both vegetation types a decreasing trend of maximum productivity with any added species emerges, contrasting the average trend that was positive in grassland, but absent in forests. The trend of maximum values was non-significant in grasslands probably due to the fact that not all combinations of species mixtures were available. In temperate forests, maximum productivity decreases significantly by about 10% in regional studies and by 8% at national scale with each added species. Maximum biomass per area was the same for managed and unmanaged conditions. A global assessment of NPP and biodiversity could also not confirm a general positive biodiversity-productivity relationship. Conclusions: Managed grasslands and forests reach highest productivity and volumes at low diversity. Also globally we could not confirm a biodiversity effect on productivity. Despite this, for long-living organisms, such as trees, the incentive for land managers exists to reduce the risk of failure due to climate extremes and diseases by taking a loss in productivity into account and to actively maintain a mixture of species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodiversity; Forests; Grasslands; Land Management; Maximum Rates; Productivity","","","","","Bouriaud, Olivier, Romanian legal management rules limit wood production in Norway spruce and beech forests, Forest Ecosystems, 3, 1, (2016); Zeitgemae Grunlandbewirtschaftung, (2004); Perspect Plant Ecol, (2017); Cramer, Wolfgang, Global response of terrestrial ecosystem structure and function to CO2 and climate change: Results from six dynamic global vegetation models, Global Change Biology, 7, 4, pp. 357-373, (2001); Ellis, Erle Christopher, All is not loss: Plant biodiversity in the anthropocene, PLOS ONE, 7, 1, (2012); Hector, Andy, Plant diversity and productivity experiments in European grasslands, Science, 286, 5442, pp. 1123-1127, (1999); Agroecology, (2015); Isbell, Forest I., Biodiversity increases the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate extremes, Nature, 526, 7574, pp. 574-577, (2015); Jucker, Tommaso, Stabilizing effects of diversity on aboveground wood production in forest ecosystems: Linking patterns and processes, Ecology Letters, 17, 12, pp. 1560-1569, (2014); Liang, Jingjing, Positive biodiversity-productivity relationship predominant in global forests, Science, 354, 6309, (2016)","","SpringerOpen","","","","","","20956355; 21975620","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050387748"

The objective of this work is to study the spatial distribution of SOM in a highly exploited agricultural area in the Baranja Region (Croatia). The spatially dense dataset available (4825 top-soil samples from 0 to 30 cm) allowed to produce reliable SOM maps using geostatistical interpolation kriging algorithms and to study the relationships with possible influencing factors. The interpolation has been conducted by means of two approaches. In one approach, the overall data set is considered for computing a global variogram and performing a direct interpolation of SOM values. In the second approach, the data are stratified according to two different geological and morphogenetic domains, Holocene Domain (HD) and Pleistocene Domain (PD), and a distinct geostatistical analysis is performed in each domain. The results showed that average SOM in the studied region was 2.29%, indicating a future need for adopting sustainable soil management practices in this region. SOM was significantly higher in HD (2.64%) than PD (1.97%) domain. SOM in PD generally had a much lower global variability. Global dataset analysis reveals that regional intrinsic factors prevail over local intrinsic and extrinsic factors in determining SOM spatial patterns. In contrast, the stratified approach can filter the effect of regional variability related to the main geological and geomorphological setting. The structural spatial correlation in PD is weaker than in HD, as manifested by spatial patches of low and high SOM content with smaller extension in PD with respect to HD. The strong relationships between SOM spatial patterns and geological/geomorphological factors suggest the possibility of adopting finer subdivision criteria in future research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agroecosystem; Auxiliary Data; Geology; Geostatistics; Kriging; Soil Quality; Agronomy; Biogeochemistry; Biological Materials; Geology; Interpolation; Mapping; Organic Compounds; Agro Ecosystems; Auxiliary Data; Geo-statistics; Kriging; Soil Quality; Soils; Soil Organic Matter; Agricultural Ecosystem; Geostatistics; Kriging; Mapping; Soil Quality; Spatial Distribution; Article; Controlled Study; Croatia; Geographic Mapping; Geology; Geomorphology; Geostatistical Analysis; Holocene; Pleistocene; Priority Journal; Soil Analysis; Soil Management; Baranja","Agronomy; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Geology; Interpolation; Mapping; Organic compounds; Agro ecosystems; Auxiliary data; Geo-statistics; Kriging; Soil quality; Soils; soil organic matter; agricultural ecosystem; geostatistics; kriging; mapping; soil quality; spatial distribution; Article; controlled study; Croatia; geographic mapping; geology; geomorphology; geostatistical analysis; Holocene; Pleistocene; priority journal; soil analysis; soil management; Baranja","","","","Agegnehu, Getachew, Benefits of biochar, compost and biochar-compost for soil quality, maize yield and greenhouse gas emissions in a tropical agricultural soil, Science of the Total Environment, 543, pp. 295-306, (2016); Soils of Croatia, (2013); Bilandžija, Darìja, Influence of tillage practices and crop type on soil CO2 emissions, Sustainability (Switzerland), 8, 1, (2016); undefined, (1975); Bogunovic, Igor, Spatial variation of soil nutrients on sandy-loam soil, Soil and Tillage Research, 144, pp. 174-183, (2014); Bogunovic, Igor, Soil compaction under different management practices in a Croatian vineyard, Arabian Journal of Geosciences, 10, 15, (2017); Bogunovic, Igor, Spatial distribution of soil chemical properties in an organic farm in Croatia, Science of the Total Environment, 584-585, pp. 535-545, (2017); Bogunovic, Igor, Short-range and regional spatial variability of soil chemical properties in an agro-ecosystem in eastern Croatia, Catena, 154, pp. 50-62, (2017); Brevik, Eric C., Soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling: History and future directions, Geoderma, 264, pp. 256-274, (2016); 8th Iag International Conference on Geomorphology Paris France, (2013)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00489697; 18791026","","STEVA","29940445","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048745551"

The standard procedure proposed by international organizations consists of a set of indicators (one or more per target) assessed at country level. However, such country scale assessments have only limited potential for regional or national policymaking, because of aggregation and averaging effects, which limit the identification of phenomena, their causal relationships, and their spatial-temporal dynamics. The need thus emerges for defining assessment procedures that go beyond national level aggregation and zoom into local phenomena, while maintaining a link with the approach adopted at the global level for monitoring and reporting the progress toward the meeting of the SDGs. SDG 6 focuses on water resources and aims at achieving safe water and sanitation for all, which are essential to human health, environmental sustainability, and economic prosperity. SDG 6 is evidently interconnected with several other SDGs, and in particular with those focused on food production (SDG2) and other socio-economic activities using water as a production factor. This paper proposes an approach to assess SDG 6, based upon freely available global data sets. The methodology is suitable for both reporting at international level in accordance with approved guidelines proposed by custodian agencies and -more importantly-analyzing the spatial features of the phenomena related to the SDGs and their targets, producing information useful to support effective sustainability oriented policies. The proposed approach is demonstrated for the assessment of the indicator 6.4.1 (Change in water use efficiency) in South and South-East Asia, with the ambition to provide operational solutions timely applicable at the global level by exploiting the ever-increasing availability of spatial information deriving from ongoing exercises in the field of global change. This will allow identifying current and emerging water management issues, such as the areas where strategies are required to increase the availability of water resources, or those necessitating transboundary strategies.

In this study, using trend, relative difference ratio (RDR), and spatial comparisons, we evaluated the accuracy of China pasture data in the HYDE (versions 3.1 and 3.2), SAGE, and PJ datasets using historical document-based reconstructions, including the land use datasets for China covering 1935–1997 (hereafter Ge-dataset) and Northeast China covering the 1700s–2000 (hereafter Ye-dataset), and the satellite-based China’s Land-Use/cover Datasets (CLUDs) for 1980–2015. Four important results were obtained. (1) China pasture area in the HYDE, SAGE, and PJ datasets and grassland area in the Ge-dataset, Ye-dataset, and CLUDs show both disparate trends and large differences in absolute values.

The percentage of grids with RDRs less than 20% were 24.9%, 26.7%, and 16.0%, respectively. (3) Based on HYDE3.2, the spatial distribution of pasture in Northeast China over the last 300 year has expanded, which is in contrast to the results from the Ye-dataset, which shows the spatial distribution of grassland shrinking because of human reclamation activities.

Existing field scale models that track plant growth as well as the fate and transport of applied pesticides lack an integrated sediment transport component. This study sought to address this lack of available modeling tools for researchers and regulators by integrating the sediment and surface flow components of Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems (GLEAMS) model into the mature Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) to create a derivative model named RZWQM-Sed. Previous research identified RZWQM as a quick running, agricultural field scale model that accurately estimated offsite transport of solutes. Unlike other well performing field scale agricultural models, the full source code of RZWQM was available for modification and extension. However, RZWQM lacked a sediment component and thus could not measure all pollutants moving offsite. GLEAMS sedimentation was chosen for integration due to its well documented history, compatibility with the RZWQM codebase, and source code availability. Sensitivity analysis of the RZWQM runoff variables showed that the residual water content, saturated water content, and bubbling pressure from the Brooks-Corey equation had the highest influence for RZWQM followed by the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the non-Brooks-Corey bubbling pressure. Analysis of GLEAMS variables showed the most significant variables are the USLE parameters (cfact, pfact, ksoil) and Manning's N.

The integrated model was calibrated and validated using multiple real-world datasets spanning ranges of space and time.

The customization involve: (1) use of Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) dataset for dynamic forcing fields, (2) ability to ingest local information about the soil characteristics (3) high resolution USGS land-cover and other static datasets, amongst others. In this paper, we present the performance of the customized model against SMAP soil moisture data and local sensors observations. The first results from the comparison shows a significantly reduced errors in model results.

The spatial resolution and temporal continuity of global cropland maps have been improving and several global data sets are released recently. Here, we calculated country-level cropland areas from the annual land-cover (LC) maps produced by the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) project and from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations statistical data (FAOSTAT) from 1992 to 2014. Because these two data sets used different approaches for generating the cropland data, we further quantified the consistency/difference in cropland areas and temporal changes between both products. Using log-transformed the time-averaged country-level cropland areas, a good linear relationship was found between these two products across different countries. However, only 8% of countries (mostly Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries) showed cropland area difference smaller than 1% between ESA-CCI and FAOSTAT. The cropland areas (without mosaic cropland types) from ESA-CCI are lower than the areas from FAOSTAT in 26% of countries but higher in 66% of countries. The magnitude of the latter difference (i.e. higher estimates of ESA-CCI than FAOSTAT) would be further amplified if crop intensity was taken into account. In addition, opposite temporal trends of cropland areas were found between these two data sets in 41% of countries. Although there are uncertainties in ESA-CCI LC maps, resulting from remote-sensing techniques such as mixed pixels, spectral similar objects, and same subject with different spectrum, the long time series and relatively high resolution of this product help us to understand the differences between satellite-based and inventory-based data sets and thus identify the possible strategies to improve the accuracy of satellite-based LC products. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crops; International Cooperation; Remote Sensing; Time Series; European Space Agency; Food And Agricultural Organizations; Linear Relationships; Organization For Economic Co-operation And Development; Remote Sensing Techniques; Spatial Resolution; Spatially Explicit; Temporal Continuity; Climate Change; Accuracy Assessment; Comparative Study; Data Set; Land Cover; Mapping; Remote Sensing; Statistical Data; Time Series Analysis","Crops; International cooperation; Remote sensing; Time series; European Space Agency; Food and agricultural organizations; Linear relationships; Organization for economic co-operation and development; Remote sensing techniques; Spatial resolution; Spatially explicit; Temporal continuity; Climate change; accuracy assessment; comparative study; data set; land cover; mapping; remote sensing; statistical data; time series analysis","","","This research was partially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant number: 2017YFA0604401), the research grant from Tsinghua University (grant number: 20151080351) and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant number: Y4YR1300QM).

Specifically robots for precision agriculture open up possibilities for new applications. Such applications typically require a high accuracy of the underlying navigation system. A cornerstone for reliable navigation is the robust detection of crop rows. However, detecting crops from vision or laser data is particularly challenging when the plants are either tiny or so large that individual plants cannot be distinguished easily. In this letter, we present a pipeline for reliable plant segmentation in any crop growth stage, as well as a novel algorithm for robust crop row detection that adapts the Hough transform for line detection to detect a pattern of parallel equidistant lines. Our algorithm is able to jointly estimate the angle, lateral offset and crop row spacing and is particularly suited for tiny plants. In extensive experiments using various real-world data sets from different kinds and sizes of crops we show that our algorithm provides reliable and accurate results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Automation; Field Robots; Robotics In Agriculture And Forestry; Agriculture; Cameras; Crops; Feature Extraction; Forestry; Hough Transforms; Mathematical Transformations; Navigation Systems; Robotics; Crop Row Detection; Field Robot; New Applications; Robot Kinematics; Robot Sensing System; Robotic Solutions; Robust Detection; Sustainable Farming; Robots","Agriculture; Cameras; Crops; Feature extraction; Forestry; Hough transforms; Mathematical transformations; Navigation systems; Robotics; Crop row detection; Field robot; New applications; Robot kinematics; Robot sensing system; Robotic solutions; Robust detection; Sustainable Farming; Robots","","","","Kise, Michio, A stereovision-based crop row detection method for tractor-automated guidance, Biosystems Engineering, 90, 4, pp. 357-367, (2005); Søgaard, Henning Tangen, Determination of crop rows by image analysis without segmentation, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 38, 2, pp. 141-158, (2003); Tillett, Nick D., Computer-vision-based hoe guidance for cereals - An initial trial, Journal of Agricultural and Engineering Research, 74, 3, pp. 225-236, (1999); Åstrand, Björn S., A vision based row-following system for agricultural field machinery, Mechatronics, 15, 2, pp. 251-269, (2005); Bakker, Tijmen, A vision based row detection system for sugar beet, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 60, 1, pp. 87-95, (2008); Leemans, Vincent, Line cluster detection using a variant of the Hough transform for culture row localisation, Image and Vision Computing, 24, 5, pp. 541-550, (2006); Method and Means for Recognizing Complex Patterns, (1962); Meyer, George E., Verification of color vegetation indices for automated crop imaging applications, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 63, 2, pp. 282-293, (2008); Bornimer Agrartechnische Berichte, (2015); Pérez, Alberto J., Colour and shape analysis techniques for weed detection in cereal fields, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 25, 3, pp. 197-212, (2000)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","23773766","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063307249"

Yet, the magnitude and timing of these dynamics are still unclear. We compiled a global data set of 836 paired-sites to quantify temporal SOC changes after grassland-related LUC. In order to discriminate between SOC losses from the initial ecosystem and gains from the secondary one, the post-LUC time series of SOC data was combined with satellite-based net primary production observations as a proxy of carbon input to the soil. Globally, land conversion from either cropland or forest into grassland leads to SOC accumulation; the reverse shows net SOC loss. The SOC response curves vary between different regions. Conversion of cropland to managed grassland results in more SOC accumulation than natural grassland recovery from abandoned cropland. We did not consider the biophysical variables (e.g., climate conditions and soil properties) when fitting the SOC turnover rate into the observation data but analyzed the relationships between the fitted turnover rate and these variables. The SOC turnover rate is significantly correlated with temperature and precipitation (p < 0.05), but not with the clay fraction of soils (p > 0.05). Comparing our results with predictions from bookkeeping models, we found that bookkeeping models overestimate by 56% of the long-term (100 years horizon) cumulative SOC emissions for grassland-related LUC types in tropical and temperate regions since 2000. We also tested the spatial representativeness of our data set and calculated SOC response curves using the representative subset of sites in each region. Our study provides new insight into the impact grassland-related LUC on the global carbon budget and sheds light on the potential of grassland conservation for climate mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Land-use And Land-cover Change; Npp; Soil Carbon Response Curve; Soil Organic Carbon; Temporal Change; Carbon; Carbon; Soil; Carbon; Agriculture; Carbon Sequestration; Chemistry; China; Climate; Ecosystem; Forest; Grassland; Soil; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate; Ecosystem; Forests; Grassland; Soil","carbon; agriculture; carbon sequestration; chemistry; China; climate; ecosystem; forest; grassland; soil; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate; Ecosystem; Forests; Grassland; Soil","","carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon; Soil","W.L. and C.

Thus, it is critical to understand the sustainability and security of water resources. This study aims to understand how we can adequately and efficiently quantify water use sustainability at both regional and global scales with an indicator-based approach. A case study of South Korea was examined with the framework widely used to quantify global human water threats. We estimated the human water threat with both global and local datasets, showing that the water security index using global data was adequately correlated with the index for regional data. However, particularly poor associations were found in the investment benefit factors. Furthermore, we examined several different aspects of the index with the local datasets as they have relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. For example, we used cropland percentage, population and moderate water use as surrogate indicators instead of employing the approximately 20 original indicators, and we presented a regression model that was able to capture the spatial variations from the original threat index to some extent. This finding implies that it would be possible to predict water security or sustainability using existing indicator datasets for future periods, although it would require regionally developed relationships between water security and such indicators. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Integrated Index; Sustainability; Water Security; Climate Change; Regression Analysis; Water Resources; Case-studies; Fresh Water Resources; Integrated Index; Land-cover Change; Regional Scale; South Korea; Urban Expansion; Water Security; Water Use; Waters Resources; Sustainable Development; Future Prospect; Spatial Variation; Sustainability; Water Management; Water Planning; Water Resource; Article; Cropland; Environmental Parameters; Priority Journal; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Water Security Threat; Water Supply; Water Use Sustainability; Agriculture; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Protection; Human; Statistics And Numerical Data; Supply And Distribution; Fresh Water; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Humans; Republic Of Korea; Water Resources; Water Supply","Climate change; Regression analysis; Water resources; Case-studies; Fresh water resources; Integrated index; Land-cover change; Regional scale; South Korea; Urban expansion; Water security; Water use; Waters resources; Sustainable development; future prospect; spatial variation; sustainability; water management; water planning; water resource; Article; cropland; environmental parameters; priority journal; spatiotemporal analysis; water security threat; water supply; water use sustainability; agriculture; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; human; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; fresh water; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Humans; Republic of Korea; Water Resources; Water Supply","","","This study was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning ( 2015R1C1A2A01054800 ) and by the Infrastructure and Transportation Technology Promotion Research Program funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korea ( 17RDRP-B076272-04 ).

Our species' subsistence varies widely, from predominantly foraging strategies, to plantbased agriculture and animal husbandry. The extent to which environmental, social and historical factors have driven such variation is currently unclear. Prior attempts to resolve longstanding debates on this topic have been hampered by an over-reliance on narrative arguments, small and geographically narrow samples, and by contradictory findings. Here we overcome these methodological limitations by applying multimodel inference tools developed in biogeography to a global dataset (818 societies). Although some have argued that unique conditions and events determine each society's particular subsistence strategy, we find strong support for a general global pattern in which a limited set of environmental, social and historical factors predicts an essential characteristic of all human groups: How we obtain our food. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Animal Husbandry; Biogeography; Foraging; Subsistence","","","","Data accessibility.

Field studies have been performed for decades on bioenergy crops, but only a small proportion of the available data is used to explore future land use scenarios including bioenergy crops. A global dataset of biomass production for key lignocellulosic bioenergy crops is thus needed to disentangle the factors impacting biomass production in different regions. Such dataset will be also useful to develop and assess bioenergy crop modelling in integrated assessment socio-economic models and global vegetation models. Here, we compiled and described a global biomass yield dataset based on field measurements. We extracted 5,088 entries of data from 257 published studies for five main lingocellulosic bioenergy crops: eucalypt, Miscanthus, poplar, switchgrass, and willow. Data are from 355 geographic sites in 31 countries around the world. We also documented the species, plantation practices, climate conditions, soil property, and managements.

We explored the effect of long-term N and NPK fertilization on soil bacterial diversity and community composition using meta-analysis of a global dataset. Nitrogen fertilization decreased soil pH, and increased soil organic carbon (C) and available N contents. Bacterial taxonomic diversity was decreased by N fertilization alone, but was increased by NPK fertilization. The effect of N fertilization on bacterial diversity varied with soil texture and water management, but was independent of crop type or N application rate. Changes in bacterial diversity were positively related to both soil pH and organic C content under N fertilization alone, but only to soil organic C under NPK fertilization. Microbial biomass C decreased with decreasing bacterial diversity under long-term N fertilization. Nitrogen fertilization increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, but reduced the abundance of Acidobacteria, consistent with the general life history strategy theory for bacteria. The positive correlation between N application rate and the relative abundance of Actinobacteria indicates that increased N availability favored the growth of Actinobacteria. This first global analysis of long-term N and NPK fertilization that differentially affects bacterial diversity and community composition provides a reference for nutrient management strategies for maintaining belowground microbial diversity in agro-ecosystems worldwide. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Actinobacteria; Agro-ecosystems; Bacterial Diversity; Community Composition; Microbial Biomass; N Fertilization; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Agricultural Ecosystem; Bacterium; Biomass; Fertilizer Application; Growth Rate; Microbial Community; Nitrogen; Relative Abundance; Species Diversity; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Proteobacteria; Fertilizer; Phosphorus; Potassium; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Meta Analysis; Microbiology; Microflora; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Fertilizers; Microbiota; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Soil Microbiology","agricultural ecosystem; bacterium; biomass; fertilizer application; growth rate; microbial community; nitrogen; relative abundance; species diversity; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Proteobacteria; fertilizer; phosphorus; potassium; agriculture; ecosystem; meta analysis; microbiology; microflora; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Fertilizers; Microbiota; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Soil Microbiology","","nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium","Funding text 1: National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41721001; National Basic Research Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2014CB441003; Funding text 2: This research was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41721001), the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB441003), the China Agriculture Research System, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

Measurement of enteric CH<inf>4</inf> is complex, expensive, and impractical at large scales; therefore, models are commonly used to predict CH<inf>4</inf> production. However, building robust prediction models requires extensive data from animals under different management systems worldwide. The objectives of this study were to (1) collate a global database of enteric CH<inf>4</inf> production from individual lactating dairy cattle; (2) determine the availability of key variables for predicting enteric CH<inf>4</inf> production (g/day per cow), yield [g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)], and intensity (g/kg energy corrected milk) and their respective relationships; (3) develop intercontinental and regional models and cross-validate their performance; and (4) assess the trade-off between availability of on-farm inputs and CH<inf>4</inf> prediction accuracy. The intercontinental database covered Europe (EU), the United States (US), and Australia (AU). A sequential approach was taken by incrementally adding key variables to develop models with increasing complexity. Methane emissions were predicted by fitting linear mixed models. Within model categories, an intercontinental model with the most available independent variables performed best with root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) as a percentage of mean observed value of 16.6%, 14.7%, and 19.8% for intercontinental, EU, and United States regions, respectively. Less complex models requiring only DMI had predictive ability comparable to complex models. Enteric CH<inf>4</inf> production, yield, and intensity prediction models developed on an intercontinental basis had similar performance across regions, however, intercepts and slopes were different with implications for prediction. Revised CH<inf>4</inf> emission conversion factors for specific regions are required to improve CH<inf>4</inf> production estimates in national inventories. In conclusion, information on DMI is required for good prediction, and other factors such as dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration, improve the prediction. For enteric CH<inf>4</inf> yield and intensity prediction, information on milk yield and composition is required for better estimation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dairy Cows; Dry Matter Intake; Enteric Methane Emissions; Methane Intensity; Methane Yield; Prediction Models; Methane; Methane; Carbon Emission; Cattle; Database; Dry Matter; Greenhouse Gas; Methane; Modeling; Prediction; Australia; Europe; United States; Animalia; Bos; Agriculture; Animal; Bovine; Eating; European Union; Factual Database; Female; Lactation; Metabolism; Milk; Physiology; Procedures; Statistics And Numerical Data; Theoretical Model; Agriculture; Animals; Cattle; Databases, Factual; Eating; Female; Lactation; Methane; Milk; Models, Theoretical","carbon emission; cattle; database; dry matter; greenhouse gas; methane; modeling; prediction; Australia; Europe; United States; Animalia; Bos; agriculture; animal; bovine; eating; European Union; factual database; female; lactation; metabolism; milk; physiology; procedures; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; Agriculture; Animals; Cattle; Databases, Factual; Eating; Female; Lactation; Methane; Milk; Models, Theoretical","","methane, 74-82-8; Methane","Funding text 1: This study is part of the Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE-JPI)'s ?GLOBAL NETWORK? project and the ?Feeding and Nutrition Network?

In total, 5023 infiltration curves were collected across all continents in the SWIG database. These data were either provided and quality checked by the scientists who performed the experiments or they were digitized from published articles. Data from 54 different countries were included in the database with major contributions from Iran, China, and the USA. In addition to its extensive geographical coverage, the collected infiltration curves cover research from 1976 to late 2017. Basic information on measurement location and method, soil properties, and land use was gathered along with the infiltration data, making the database valuable for the development of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) for estimating soil hydraulic properties, for the evaluation of infiltration measurement methods, and for developing and validating infiltration models. Soil textural information (clay, silt, and sand content) is available for 3842 out of 5023 infiltration measurements (∼76%) covering nearly all soil USDA textural classes except for the sandy clay and silt classes. Information on land use is available for 76ĝ€% of the experimental sites with agricultural land use as the dominant type (∼40%). We are convinced that the SWIG database will allow for a better parameterization of the infiltration process in land surface models and for testing infiltration models. All collected data and related soil characteristics are provided online in ∗.xlsx and ∗.csv formats for reference, and we add a disclaimer that the database is for public domain use only and can be copied freely by referencing it. Supplementary data are available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.885492 (Rahmati et al., 2018). Data quality assessment is strongly advised prior to any use of this database. Finally, we would like to encourage scientists to extend and update the SWIG database by uploading new data to it. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Funding text 1: First author thanks the International and Scientific Cooperation Office of the University of Maragheh, Iran, as well as the research committee and board members of the university for their assistance in conducting the current work.

Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the SD of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Food Security; Price Volatility; Article; Climate; Correlational Study; Crop Production; Environmental Temperature; Food Security; Greenhouse Effect; Heat Tolerance; Irrigation (agriculture); Maize; Plant Breeding; Priority Journal; Seasonal Variation; Temperature Sensitivity; Catering Service; Commercial Phenomena; Economics; Food Grain; Forecasting; Growth, Development And Aging; Heat; Human; Marketing; Poverty; Statistics And Numerical Data; Supply And Distribution; Vulnerable Population; Commerce; Edible Grain; Food Supply; Forecasting; Global Warming; Hot Temperature; Humans; Marketing; Plant Breeding; Poverty; Vulnerable Populations; Zea Mays","Article; climate; correlational study; crop production; environmental temperature; food security; greenhouse effect; heat tolerance; irrigation (agriculture); maize; plant breeding; priority journal; seasonal variation; temperature sensitivity; catering service; commercial phenomena; economics; food grain; forecasting; growth, development and aging; heat; human; marketing; poverty; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; vulnerable population; Commerce; Edible Grain; Food Supply; Forecasting; Global Warming; Hot Temperature; Humans; Marketing; Plant Breeding; Poverty; Vulnerable Populations; Zea mays","","","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

J., School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom","Sowing and harvest dates are a significant source of uncertainty within crop models, especially for regions where high-resolution data are unavailable or, as is the case in future climate runs, where no data are available at all. Global datasets are not always able to distinguish when wheat is grown in tropical and subtropical regions, and they are also often coarse in resolution. South Asia is one such region where large spatial variation means higher-resolution datasets are needed, together with greater clarity for the timing of the main wheat growing season. Agriculture in South Asia is closely associated with the dominating climatological phenomenon, the Asian summer monsoon (ASM). Rice and wheat are two highly important crops for the region, with rice being mainly cultivated in the wet season during the summer monsoon months and wheat during the dry winter. We present a method for estimating the crop sowing and harvest dates for rice and wheat using the ASM onset and retreat. The aim of this method is to provide a more accurate alternative to the global datasets of cropping calendars than is currently available and generate more representative inputs for climate impact assessments. <br><br> We first demonstrate that there is skill in the model prediction of monsoon onset and retreat for two downscaled general circulation models (GCMs) by comparing modelled precipitation with observations. We then calculate and apply sowing and harvest rules for rice and wheat for each simulation to climatological estimates of the monsoon onset and retreat for a present day period. We show that this method reproduces the present day sowing and harvest dates for most parts of India. The application of the method to two future simulations demonstrates that the estimated sowing and harvest dates are successfully modified to ensure that the growing season remains consistent with the internal model climate. The study therefore provides a useful way of modelling potential growing season adaptations to changes in future climate. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric Thermodynamics; Crops; Cultivation; Harvesting; Asian Summer Monsoons; Climate Impact Assessment; Climatological Estimates; General Circulation Model; High Resolution Data; Higher Resolution; Spatial Variations; Subtropical Regions; Climate Models; Climate Change; Estimation Method; Growing Season; Harvesting; Monsoon; Rice; Sowing Date; Summer; Wheat; India; Triticum Aestivum","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Crops; Cultivation; Harvesting; Asian summer monsoons; Climate impact assessment; Climatological estimates; General circulation model; High resolution data; Higher resolution; Spatial variations; Subtropical regions; Climate models; climate change; estimation method; growing season; harvesting; monsoon; rice; sowing date; summer; wheat; India; Triticum aestivum","","","Acknowledgements.

As the volume of international trade continues to rise, so does the understanding that trade of water-intensive crops from areas with high precipitation, to arid regions can help mitigate water scarcity, highlighting the importance of crop water accounting. Virtual-Water, or Water-Footprint [WF] of agricultural crops, is a powerful indicator for assessing the extent of water use by plants, contamination of water bodies by agricultural practices and trade between countries, which underlies any international trade of crops. Most available studies of virtual-water flows by import/export of agricultural commodities were based on global databases, which are considered to be of limited accuracy. The present study analyzes the WF of crop production, import, and export on a country level, using Israel as a case study, comparing data from two high-resolution local databases and two global datasets. Results for local datasets demonstrate a WF of ~ 1200 Million Cubic Meters [MCM]/year) for total crop production, ~ 1000 MCM/year for import and ~ 250 MCM/year for export. Fruits and vegetables comprise ~ 80% of Export WF (~ 200 MCM/year), ~ 50% of crop production and only ~ 20% of the imports. Economic Water Productivity [EWP] ($/m3) for fruits and vegetables is 1.5 higher compared to other crops. Moreover, the results based on local and global datasets varied significantly, demonstrating the importance of developing high-resolution local datasets based on local crop coefficients. Performing high resolution WF analysis can help in developing agricultural policies that include support for low WF/high EWP and limit high WF/low EWP crop export, where water availability is limited. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Export; Import; Israel; Water Foot Print; Water Use; Starch; Agriculture; Commerce; Cultivation; Flow Of Water; Fruits; Hydraulics; International Trade; Vegetables; Water Management; Agricultural Commodities; Agricultural Policies; Agricultural Practices; Export; Fruits And Vegetables; Import; Israel; Water Use; Crops; Carbohydrate; Fresh Water; Ground Water; Rain; Starch; Agricultural Practice; Crop Production; International Trade; Water Availability; Water Flow; Water Footprint; Water Management; Agricultural Parameters; Article; Commercial Phenomena; Comparative Study; Cost; Evapotranspiration; Food Grain; Fruit; Information Processing; Irrigation (agriculture); Measurement Accuracy; Nut; Plant Water Use; Priority Journal; Productivity; Quantitative Analysis; Vegetable; Water Supply","Agriculture; Commerce; Cultivation; Flow of water; Fruits; Hydraulics; International trade; Vegetables; Water management; Agricultural commodities; Agricultural policies; Agricultural practices; export; Fruits and vegetables; import; Israel; Water use; Crops; carbohydrate; fresh water; ground water; rain; starch; agricultural practice; crop production; international trade; water availability; water flow; water footprint; water management; agricultural parameters; Article; commercial phenomena; comparative study; cost; evapotranspiration; food grain; fruit; information processing; irrigation (agriculture); measurement accuracy; nut; plant water use; priority journal; productivity; quantitative analysis; vegetable; water supply","","starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9","The project was supported by the Chief Scientist's Fund of the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture , research project No. 20-13-0024-16 .

VCI calculated using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data obtained from NOAA AVHRR, SPEI obtained from the SPEI global database with the version (SPEI base v2.5), and Land use/cover obtained from CORINE datasets. The study covers the period from January 1982 to December 2015 due to the availability of NDVI data. The correlation between monthly and seasonal VCI and SPEI (lag months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12) was investigated in a regional and provincial scale. Monthly correlation found to be the highest in the Central Anatolia, Aegean, Marmara and Mediterranean regions respectively, while other regions have lower and non-homogenous values. One lag time of the VCI with respect to SPEI 12 improves the correlation. The regional correlation showed that, the highest correlation between two parameters is obtained for all the regions with SPEI 12 during summer, then followed by Autumn, and Spring months, the maximum values are recorded for the Central Anatolia (0.656) and Mediterranean (0.625) in Summer, and Aegean (0.643) in Autumn respectively; rather lower correlation values did occur in Marmara (0.515) in Autumn, Eastern Anatolia (0.501), SE Anatolia (0.375) and Black Sea (0.297) regions in Summer. The provincial investigation between seasonal VCI and SPEI indicated that the presence of a positive correlation in general in most of the provinces in all seasons with several exceptions in the Eastern Anatolia, South eastern Anatolia, Black sea, and Marmara. The land cover types with high correlation coefficients are noticed to be covered by forest, agricultural lands, non-irrigable lands and mostly covered by fruits (grape, olive etc.) using CORINE land cover map. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corine; Drought Analysis; Ndvi; Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; Turkey; Vegetation Condition Index; Disaster Prevention; Disasters; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Land Use; Vegetation; Corine; Drought Analysis; Ndvi; Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; Turkey; Vegetation Condition Indices; Drought","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Land use; Vegetation; CORINE; Drought analysis; NDVI; Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; Turkey; Vegetation condition indices; Drought","","","","Crop Evapotranspiration Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements, (1998); Anyamba, Assaf, NDVI anomaly patterns over Africa during the 1997/98 ENSO warm event, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 22, 10, pp. 1847-1859, (2001); Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran, Parinaz, Using AVHRR-based vegetation indices for drought monitoring in the Northwest of Iran, Journal of Arid Environments, 72, 6, pp. 1086-1096, (2008); Beguería, Santiago, A multiscalar global drought dataset: The SPEI base: A new gridded product for the analysis of drought variability and impacts, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 91, 10, pp. 1351-1356, (2010); Beguería, Santiago, Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) revisited: Parameter fitting, evapotranspiration models, tools, datasets and drought monitoring, International Journal of Climatology, 34, 10, pp. 3001-3023, (2014); Dabanlı, İsmail, Long-term spatio-temporal drought variability in Turkey, Journal of Hydrology, 552, pp. 779-792, (2017); Dogan, Selim, Comparison of multi-monthly rainfall-based drought severity indices, with application to semi-arid Konya closed basin, Turkey, Journal of Hydrology, 470-471, pp. 255-268, (2012); Dutta, Dipanwita K., Assessment of agricultural drought in Rajasthan (India) using remote sensing derived Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Egyptian Journal of Remote Sensing and Space Science, 18, 1, pp. 53-63, (2015); European Environment Agency Copenhagen, (2000); Farrar, T.

Developed initially for surface water, such indices are increasingly used to evaluate global groundwater resources. We compare indices of groundwater development stress for three major agricultural areas of the United States to information available from regional water budgets developed from detailed groundwater modeling. These comparisons illustrate the potential value of regional-scale analyses to supplement global hydrological models and GRACE analyses of groundwater depletion. Regional-scale analyses allow assessments of water stress that better account for scale effects, the dynamics of groundwater flow systems, the complexities of irrigated agricultural systems, and the laws, regulations, engineering, and socioeconomic factors that govern groundwater use.

Since cash crops are intended for future sale, they translate into large financial value when considered on a wide geographical scale, so their production directly involves financial risk. At a national level, extreme weather events including destructive rain or hail, as well as drought, can have a significant impact on the overall economic balance. It is thus important to map such crops in order to set up insurance and mitigation strategies. Using locally generated data—such as municipality-level records of crop seeding—for mapping purposes implies facing a series of issues like data availability, quality, homogeneity, etc. We thus opted for a different approach relying on global datasets. Global datasets ensure homogeneity and availability of data, although sometimes at the expense of precision and accuracy. A typical global approach makes use of spaceborne remote sensing, for which different land cover classification strategies are available in literature at different levels of cost and accuracy. We selected the optimal strategy in the perspective of a global processing chain. Thanks to a specifically developed strategy for fusing unsupervised classification results with environmental constraints and other geospatial inputs including ground-based data, we managed to obtain good classification results despite the constraints placed. The overall production process was composed using “good-enough"" algorithms at each step, ensuring that the precision, accuracy, and data-hunger of each algorithm was commensurate to the precision, accuracy, and amount of data available. This paper describes the tailored strategy developed on the occasion as a cooperation among different groups with diverse backgrounds, a strategy which is believed to be profitably reusable in other, similar contexts. The paper presents the problem, the constraints and the adopted solutions; it then summarizes the main findings including that efforts and costs can be saved on the side of Earth Observation data processing when additional ground-based data are available to support the mapping task. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Best Practice; Crop Mapping; Crowdsourcing; Drought Risk Assessment; Exposure; Flood Risk Assessment; Geospatial Data; Rule-based Classification; Spaceborne Remote Sensing; Unsupervised Classification; Agriculture; Crowdsourcing; Data Handling; Drought; Floods; Mapping; Precipitation (meteorology); Remote Sensing; Risk Assessment; Best Practices; Crop Mapping; Drought Risks; Exposure; Flood Risk Assessments; Geo-spatial Data; Rule-based Classification; Spaceborne Remote Sensing; Unsupervised Classification; Crops; Agriculture; Crop; Geography; Risk Assessment; Weather; Crops, Agricultural; Geography; Risk Assessment; Weather","Agriculture; Crowdsourcing; Data handling; Drought; Floods; Mapping; Precipitation (meteorology); Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Best practices; Crop mapping; Drought risks; Exposure; Flood risk assessments; Geo-spatial data; Rule-based classification; Spaceborne remote sensing; Unsupervised classification; Crops; agriculture; crop; geography; risk assessment; weather; Crops, Agricultural; Geography; Risk Assessment; Weather","","","Acknowledgments: This study was sponsored by the CCRIF SPC (formerly the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility) under the supervision and coordination of the consortium formed by the companies ERN (México City, México) and RED (Pavia, Italy), supported by Ticinum Aerospace (Pavia, Italy).

Irrigated areas constitute 40'% of the total area used for agricultural production (FAO, 2014a) Information on their spatial distribution is highly relevant for regional water management and food security. Spatial information on irrigation is highly important for policy and decision makers, who are facing the transition towards more efficient sustainable agriculture. However, the mapping of irrigated areas still represents a challenge for land use classifications, and existing global data sets differ strongly in their results. The following study tests an existing irrigation map based on statistics and extends the irrigated area using ancillary data. The approach processes and analyzes multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) SPOT-VGT data and agricultural suitability data &ndash; both at a spatial resolution of 30'arcsec &ndash; incrementally in a multiple decision tree. It covers the period from 1999 to 2012. The results globally show a 18'% larger irrigated area than existing approaches based on statistical data. The largest differences compared to the official national statistics are found in Asia and particularly in China and India. The additional areas are mainly identified within already known irrigated regions where irrigation is more dense than previously estimated. The validation with global and regional products shows the large divergence of existing data sets with respect to size and distribution of irrigated areas caused by spatial resolution, the considered time period and the input data and assumption made. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Classification (of Information); Decision Making; Decision Trees; Food Supply; Image Resolution; Irrigation; Land Use; Vegetation; Water Management; Agricultural Productions; Landuse Classifications; National Statistics; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Spatial Informations; Spatial Resolution; Statistical Datas; Sustainable Agriculture; Trees (mathematics); Agricultural Production; Alternative Agriculture; Comparative Study; Data Set; Estimation Method; Food Security; Irrigation System; Land Use; Ndvi; Satellite Data; Spatial Distribution; Spatial Resolution; Spot; Statistical Analysis; Water Management; China; India","Agriculture; Classification (of information); Decision making; Decision trees; Food supply; Image resolution; Irrigation; Land use; Vegetation; Water management; Agricultural productions; Landuse classifications; National statistics; Normalized difference vegetation index; Spatial informations; Spatial resolution; Statistical datas; Sustainable agriculture; Trees (mathematics); agricultural production; alternative agriculture; comparative study; data set; estimation method; food security; irrigation system; land use; NDVI; satellite data; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; SPOT; statistical analysis; water management; China; India","","","Acknowledgements.

Here we use a global dataset of 80 published plant–pollinator interaction networks as well as pollinator effectiveness measures from 34 plant species to assess the importance of A. mellifera in natural habitats. Apis mellifera is the most frequent floral visitor in natural habitats worldwide, averaging 13% of floral visits across all networks (range 0–85%), with 5% of plant species recorded as being exclusively visited by A. mellifera. For 33% of the networks and 49% of plant species, however, A. mellifera visitation was never observed, illustrating that many flowering plant taxa and assemblages remain dependent on non-A. mellifera visitors for pollination. Apis mellifera visitation was higher in warmer, less variable climates and on mainland rather than island sites, but did not differ between its native and introduced ranges. With respect to single-visit pollination effectiveness, A. mellifera did not differ from the average non-A. mellifera floral visitor, though it was generally less effective than the most effective non-A. mellifera visitor. Our results argue for a deeper understanding of how A. mellifera, and potential future changes in its range and abundance, shape the ecology, evolution, and conservation of plants, pollinators, and their interactions in natural habitats. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Apis Mellifera; Floral Visitation; Meta-analysis; Plant–pollinator Network; Pollination; Pollination Effectiveness; Angiosperm; Climate Conditions; Data Set; Flower Visiting; Habitat Corridor; Honeybee; Meta-analysis; Plant-pollinator Interaction; Pollination; Pollinator; Spatial Analysis; Temperature Profile; Apis Mellifera; Magnoliophyta; Animal; Animal Behavior; Bee; Crop; Ecosystem; Flower; Honey; Information Processing; Physiology; Pollen; Regression Analysis; Animals; Bees; Behavior, Animal; Crops, Agricultural; Datasets As Topic; Ecosystem; Flowers; Honey; Pollen; Pollination; Regression Analysis","angiosperm; climate conditions; data set; flower visiting; habitat corridor; honeybee; meta-analysis; plant-pollinator interaction; pollination; pollinator; spatial analysis; temperature profile; Apis mellifera; Magnoliophyta; animal; animal behavior; bee; crop; ecosystem; flower; honey; information processing; physiology; pollen; regression analysis; Animals; Bees; Behavior, Animal; Crops, Agricultural; Datasets as Topic; Ecosystem; Flowers; Honey; Pollen; Pollination; Regression Analysis","","","Data accessibility.

This scheme was applied to a decade of global IR emissivity data retrieved from MetOp-A Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer measurements. Global datasets of monthlymean 0.25° spatial-grid VSM, estimated from IR emissivity data (denoted as IR-VSM), are assembled to compare with those routinely provided by satellite microwave (MW) multi-sensor measurements (obtained from the ESA CCI website). The IR-VSM dataset is used to demonstrate its spatial variations as well as seasonal-cycles and inter-Annual variability which are spatially coherent and consistent with that from MW measurements. Herein we report on some initial evaluation of the IR-VSM absolute values using in-situ measurements available from the Soil Climate Analysis Network of the USDA website. From the 114 ground station locations, we infer a mean bias between monthly-mean in-situ VSM and satellite derived IR-VSM of 0.005 (m3 /m3) over the past decade, despite the differences between physical measurements. The absolute accuracy of IR-VSM is also evaluated using an independent source of soil moisture measurements. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Remote Sensing; Retrieval; Satellite; Soil Moisture.; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Electromagnetic Wave Emission; Hydrology; Microwave Sensors; Remote Sensing; Satellites; Soil Moisture; Space Optics; Surface Roughness; Websites; In-situ Measurement; Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometers; Interannual Variability; Physical Measurement; Retrieval; Soil Moisture Measurement; Vegetation Coverage; Volumetric Soil Moistures; Soil Surveys","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Electromagnetic wave emission; Hydrology; Microwave sensors; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil moisture; Space optics; Surface roughness; Websites; In-situ measurement; Infrared atmospheric sounding interferometers; Interannual variability; Physical measurement; Retrieval; Soil moisture measurement; Vegetation coverage; Volumetric soil moistures; Soil surveys","","","was performed under the NAST-I program supported by NASA Headquarters and NASA Langley Research Center.

GLW 3 provides global population densities of cattle, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens and ducks in each land pixel at a spatial resolution of 0.083333 decimal degrees (approximately 10 km at the equator). They are accompanied by detailed metadata on the year, spatial resolution and source of the input census data. Two versions of each species distribution are produced. In the first version, livestock numbers are disaggregated within census polygons according to weights established by statistical models using high resolution spatial covariates (dasymetric weighting). In the second version, animal numbers are distributed homogeneously with equal densities within their census polygons (areal weighting) to provide spatial data layers free of any assumptions linking them to other spatial variables. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Animal; Bovine; Buffalo; Chicken; Duck; Goat; Horse; Livestock; Pig; Population Density; Sheep; Statistics And Numerical Data; Agriculture; Animals; Buffaloes; Cattle; Chickens; Ducks; Goats; Horses; Livestock; Population Density; Sheep; Swine","agriculture; animal; bovine; buffalo; chicken; duck; goat; horse; livestock; pig; population density; sheep; statistics and numerical data; Agriculture; Animals; Buffaloes; Cattle; Chickens; Ducks; Goats; Horses; Livestock; Population Density; Sheep; Swine","","","","Global Livestock Production Systems, (2011); Livestock S Long Shadow Environmental Issues and Options, (2006); World Livestock 2013 Changing Disease Landscapes, (2013); Gilbert, Marius, Intensifying poultry production systems and the emergence of avian influenza in China: A 'One Health/Ecohealth' epitome, Archives of Public Health, 75, 1, (2017); van Boeckel, Thomas P., Global trends in antimicrobial use in food animals, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 112, 18, pp. 5649-5654, (2015); van Boeckel, Thomas P., Reducing antimicrobial use in food animals, Science, 357, 6358, pp. 1350-1352, (2017); Gridded Livestock of the World 2007, (2007); Robinson, Timothy P., Mapping the global distribution of livestock, PLOS ONE, 9, 5, (2014); Nicolas, Gaëlle, Using Random Forest to improve the downscaling of global livestock census data, PLOS ONE, 11, 3, (2016); Global Mosaics of the Standard Modis Land Cover Type Data, (2014)","","Nature Publishing Groups NatureReviews@nature.com","","","","","","20524463","","","30375994","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055614271"

The platform can be used to assist the dynamic estimation of wheat yield potential as well as grain yield based on wheat images captured by the CropQuant platform. Our proposed system framework comprises three main stages. Firstly, it transforms the wheat plant raw image data using colour index of vegetation extraction (CIVE) and then segments wheat ear regions from the image to reduce the influence of the background signals. Secondly, it detects wheat ears using Gabor filter banks and K-means clustering algorithm. Finally, it estimates the number of wheat spikes within extracted wheat spike region through a regression method. The framework is tested with a real-world dataset of wheat growth images equally distributed from flowering to ripening stages. The estimations of the wheat ears were benchmarked against the ground truth produced in this study by human manual counting. Our automatic counting system achieved an average accuracy of 90.7% with a standard deviation of 0.055, at a much faster speed than human experts and hence the system has a potential to be improved for agricultural applications on wheat growth studies in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clustering; Counting; Gabor Filter; K-means; Regression; Segmentation; Wheat Spikes; Automation; Gabor Filters; K-means Clustering; Regression Analysis; Automated Screening; Automatic Counting; Background Signals; Dynamic Estimation; Regression Method; Standard Deviation; System Framework; Vegetation Extractions; Pattern Recognition","Automation; Gabor filters; K-means clustering; Regression analysis; Automated screening; Automatic counting; Background signals; Dynamic estimation; Regression method; Standard deviation; System framework; Vegetation extractions; Pattern recognition","","","Thanks due to Earlham Institute for providing the dataset for this research and also to Taibah University for providing a studentship for Ms. Najmah Alharbi to study the MSc of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery at the School of Computing Sciences, University of East Anglia.","ESA Working Paper no 12 03, (2012); Manjunath Aradhya, V.

It controls the rate of evapotranspiration, and is a key to crop production. It is widely accepted that the available water capacity in soil can be improved by increasing organic matter content. However, the increase in amount of water that is available to plants with an increase in organic matter is still uncertain and may be overestimated. To clarify this issue, we carried out a meta-analysis from 60 published studies and analysed large databases (more than 50 000 measurements globally) to seek relations between organic carbon (OC) and water content at saturation, field capacity, wilting point and available water capacity. We show that the increase in organic carbon in soil has a small effect on soil water content. A 1% mass increase in soil OC (or 10 g C kg−1 soil mineral), on average, increases water content at saturation, field capacity, wilting point and available water capacity by: 2.95, 1.61, 0.17 and 1.16 mm H<inf>2</inf>O 100 mm soil−1, respectively. The increase is larger in sandy soils, followed by loams and is least in clays. Overall the increase in available water capacity is very small; 75% of the studies reported had values between 0.7 and 2 mm 100 mm−1 with an increase of 10 g C kg−1 soil. Compared with reported annual rates of carbon sequestration after the adoption of conservation agricultural systems, the effect on soil available water is negligible. Thus, arguments for sequestering carbon to increase water storage are questionable. Conversely, global warming may cause losses in soil carbon, but the effects on soil water storage and its consequent impact on hydrological cycling might be less than thought previously. Highlights: We investigated how available water capacity can be increased with a 1% increase in soil organic carbon. We analysed data from 60 published studies and global databases with more than 50 000 measurements. The increase in organic carbon in soil has a small effect on soil water retention. A 1% mass increase in soil OC on average increased available water capacity by 1.16%, volumetrically. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Available Water Capacity; Biosphere; Carbon Sequestration; Crop Production; Evapotranspiration; Global Warming; Meta-analysis; Organic Matter; Soil Water; Water Availability; Water Retention","available water capacity; biosphere; carbon sequestration; crop production; evapotranspiration; global warming; meta-analysis; organic matter; soil water; water availability; water retention","","","Budiman Minasny is funded by the Australia Research Council Future Fellowship.","Adams, William A., THE EFFECT OF ORGANIC MATTER ON THE BULK AND TRUE DENSITIES OF SOME UNCULTIVATED PODZOLIC SOILS, Journal of Soil Sciences, 24, 1, pp. 10-17, (1973); Ankenbauer, Kyle J., The effects of soil organic matter on soil water retention and plant water use in a meadow of the Sierra Nevada, CA, Hydrological Processes, 31, 4, pp. 891-901, (2017); Assouline, Shmuel, The concept of field capacity revisited: Defining intrinsic static and dynamic criteria for soil internal drainage dynamics, Water Resources Research, 50, 6, pp. 4787-4802, (2014); Basche, Andrea D., Soil water improvements with the long-term use of a winter rye cover crop, Agricultural Water Management, 172, pp. 40-50, (2016); Farm Res, (1974); Bauer, Armand, Organic carbon effects on available water capacity of three soil textural groups, Soil Science Society of America Journal, 56, 1, pp. 248-254, (1992); Bell, M.

We applied a machine learning algorithm developing a new GPP dataset for China with 0.1° spatial resolution and monthly temporal frequency based on eddy flux measurements from 40 sites in China and surrounding countries, most of which have not been explored in previous global GPP datasets. According to our estimates, mean annual GPP over China is 6.62 ± 0.23 PgC/year during 1982–2015 with a clear gradient from southeast to northwest. The trend of GPP estimated by this study (0.020 ± 0.002 PgC/year2 from 1982 to 2015) is almost two times of that estimated by the previous global dataset. The GPP increment is widely spread with 60% area showing significant increasing trend (p <.05), except for Inner Mongolia. Most ecosystem models overestimated the GPP magnitudes but underestimated the temporal trend of GPP. The monsoon affected eastern China, in particular the area surrounding Qinling Mountain, seems having larger contribution to interannual variability (IAV) of China's GPP than the semiarid northwestern China and Tibetan Plateau. At country scale, temperature is the dominant climatic driver for IAV of GPP. The area where IAV of GPP dominated by temperature is about 42%, while precipitation and solar radiation dominate 31% and 27% respectively over semiarid area and cold-wet area. Such spatial pattern was generally consistent with global GPP dataset, except over the Tibetan Plateau and northeastern forests, but not captured by most ecosystem models, highlighting future research needs to improve the modeling of ecosystem response to climate variations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China; Climate Change; Eddy Covariance; Gross Primary Productivity; Interannual Variability; Model Tree Ensemble; Algorithm; Annual Variation; Climate Change; Climate Variation; Ecosystem Response; Eddy Covariance; Primary Production; Spatiotemporal Analysis; China; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Temperature; Trends; Uncertainty; Agriculture; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Temperature; Uncertainty","algorithm; annual variation; climate change; climate variation; ecosystem response; eddy covariance; primary production; spatiotemporal analysis; China; agriculture; ecosystem; temperature; trends; uncertainty; Agriculture; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Temperature; Uncertainty","","","Funding text 1: National Basic Research Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2013CB956303; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41530528; National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China; Funding text 2: This study was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2013CB956303), National Natural Science Foundation of China (41530528), and National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China.","Ahlström, Anders, The dominant role of semi-arid ecosystems in the trend and variability of the land CO2 sink, Science, 348, 6237, pp. 895-899, (2015); Anav, Alessandro, Spatiotemporal patterns of terrestrial gross primary production: A review, Reviews of Geophysics, 53, 3, pp. 785-818, (2015); Anav, Alessandro, Evaluating the land and ocean components of the global carbon cycle in the CMIP5 earth system models, Journal of Climate, 26, 18, pp. 6801-6843, (2013); Bai, Yongfei, Primary production and rain use efficiency across a precipitation gradient on the Mongolia plateau, Ecology, 89, 8, pp. 2140-2153, (2008); Baker, Ian T., North American gross primary productivity: Regional characterization and interannual variability, Tellus, Series B: Chemical and Physical Meteorology, 62, 5, pp. 533-549, (2010); Baldocchi, Dennis D., TURNER REVIEW No. 15.

The richer information provided by hyperspectral images has been beneficial to numerous applications, such as understanding natural environmental changes and classifying plants and soils in agriculture based on their spectral properties. In this paper, we present an efficient manifold learning based method for accurately reconstructing a hyperspectral image from a single RGB image captured by a commercial camera with known spectral response. By applying a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique to a large set of natural spectra, we show that the spectra of natural scenes lie on an intrinsically low dimensional manifold. This allows us to map an RGB vector to its corresponding hyperspectral vector accurately via our proposed novel manifold-based reconstruction pipeline.

To quantify the trade-offs between the effects of climate and CO<inf>2</inf> on water demand, we use a 'sink-strength' model of demand 3,4 which relies on the vapour-pressure deficit (VPD), incident radiation and the efficiencies of canopy-radiation use and canopy transpiration; the latter two are both dependent on CO<inf>2</inf>. This model is applied to a global data set of gridded monthly weather data over the cropping regions of maize, soybean, wheat and rice during the years 1948-2013. We find that this approach agrees well with Penman-Monteith potential evapotranspiration (PM) for the C3 crops of soybean, wheat and rice, where the competing CO<inf>2</inf> effects largely cancel each other out, but that water demand in maize is significantly overstated by a demand measure that does not include CO<inf>2</inf>, such as the PM. We find the largest changes in wheat, for which water demand has increased since 1981 over 86% of the global cropping area and by 2.3-3.6 percentage points per decade in different regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Production; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Effect; Evapotranspiration; Global Perspective; Maize; Rice; Soybean; Trade-off; Water Availability; Water Use; Wheat; Glycine Max; Triticum Aestivum; Zea Mays","agricultural production; carbon dioxide; climate effect; evapotranspiration; global perspective; maize; rice; soybean; trade-off; water availability; water use; wheat; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays","","","","Leakey, Andrew D.B., Elevated CO2 effects on plant carbon, nitrogen, and water relations: Six important lessons from FACE, Journal of Experimental Botany, 60, 10, pp. 2859-2876, (2009); Battisti, David S., Historical warnings of future food insecurity with unprecedented seasonal heat, Science, 323, 5911, pp. 240-244, (2009); Penman, H.

After accounting for reporting effort, we show that zoonotic EID risk is elevated in forested tropical regions experiencing land-use changes and where wildlife biodiversity (mammal species richness) is high. We present a new global hotspot map of spatial variation in our zoonotic EID risk index, and partial dependence plots illustrating relationships between events and predictors.

The human impact in the model is based on population density and cropland fraction, which were identified as important drivers of burned area in analyses of global datasets, and are commonly used in global models. After an evaluation of the sensitivity to these two variables we extend the model by including an additional effect of the cropland fraction on the fire duration. The general pattern of human influence is similar in both model versions: the strongest human impact is found in regions with intermediate productivity, where fire occurrence is not limited by fuel load or climatic conditions. Human effects in the model increases burned area in the tropics, while in temperate regions burned area is reduced. While the population density is similar on average for the tropical and temperate regions, the cropland fraction is higher in temperate regions, and leads to a strong suppression of fire. The model shows a low human impact in the boreal region, where both population density and cropland fraction is very low and the climatic conditions, as well as the vegetation productivity limit fire. Previous studies attributed a decrease in fire activity found in global charcoal datasets to human activity. This is confirmed by our simulations, which only show a decrease in burned area when the human influence on fire is accounted for, and not with only natural effects on fires. We assess how the vegetation-fire feedback influences the results, by comparing simulations with dynamic vegetation biogeography to simulations with prescribed vegetation. The vegetation-fire feedback increases the human impact on burned area by 10% for present day conditions. These results emphasize that projections of burned area need to account for the interactions between fire, climate, vegetation and humans. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fire; Global Fire Modeling; Human Impact; Vegetation Interaction; Charcoal; Population Distribution; Population Dynamics; Population Statistics; Productivity; Vegetation; Climatic Conditions; Global Fire; Human Impact; Human Influences; Population Densities; Suppression Of Fires; Temperate Regions; Vegetation Productivity; Fires; Agricultural Land; Anthropogenic Effect; Biogeography; Charcoal; Data Set; Global Perspective; Modeling; Population Density; Sensitivity Analysis; Temperate Environment; Tropical Region; Vegetation; Wildfire","Charcoal; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Productivity; Vegetation; Climatic conditions; Global fire; Human impact; Human influences; Population densities; Suppression of fires; Temperate regions; Vegetation productivity; Fires; agricultural land; anthropogenic effect; biogeography; charcoal; data set; global perspective; modeling; population density; sensitivity analysis; temperate environment; tropical region; vegetation; wildfire","","","","Andela, Niels, A human-driven decline in global burned area, Science, 356, 6345, pp. 1356-1362, (2017); Andela, Niels, Recent trends in African fires driven by cropland expansion and El Niño to la Niña transition, Nature Climate Change, 4, 9, pp. 791-795, (2014); Archibald, Sally A., Defining pyromes and global syndromes of fire regimes, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110, 16, pp. 6442-6447, (2013); Archibald, Sally A., What limits fire?

Using an ongoing experiment in France, we assessed whether two protocols, widely used in international projects and global databases, provide similar estimates of earthworm abundance, and detect the same community responses to agricultural intensification. Method A consisted of hand-sorting composite samples of three soil monoliths 35 × 35 × 20 cm each, and applying formalin in the resulting holes. Method B consisted of applying formalin over a 1 m2 contiguous area and subsequently hand-sorting a 25 × 25 × 25 cm soil monolith within it. Higher abundance was obtained from Method A than from Method B, but the two methods led to the same ecological conclusions. Firstly, they both showed that earthworm biomass and density decreased with agricultural intensification. Secondly, they showed similar land use effects on earthworm ecological group proportions, age structure, and body size distribution, pointing to a relative loss of large-bodied earthworms with agricultural intensification. These findings suggest that data from the two methods are both suitable to investigate the community response of earthworms, whereas assessments of earthworm abundance per se are more sensitive to the sampling protocol. Merits and drawbacks of the methods in terms of time and labour needed and of statistical variation are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Body Size Distribution; Data Integration; Ecological Group; Land Use; Lumbricidae; Soil Fauna","","","","","Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility A Handbook of Methods, (1993); Andriuzzi, Walter S., Anecic earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) alleviate negative effects of extreme rainfall events on soil and plants in field mesocosms, Plant and Soil, 397, 1-2, pp. 103-113, (2015); Andriuzzi, Walter S., Organic matter composition and the protist and nematode communities around anecic earthworm burrows, Biology and Fertility of Soils, 52, 1, pp. 91-100, (2016); Bartlett, Mark David, A critical review of current methods in earthworm ecology: From individuals to populations, European Journal of Soil Biology, 46, 2, pp. 67-73, (2010); Blouin, Manuel, A review of earthworm impact on soil function and ecosystem services, European Journal of Soil Science, 64, 2, pp. 161-182, (2013); Ecologie Et Systematique, (1972); Ecol Bull, (1977); Brown, George G., Regulation of soil organic matter dynamics and microbial activity in the drilosphere and the role of interactions with other edaphic functional domains, European Journal of Soil Biology, 36, 3-4, pp. 177-198, (2000); Chabbi, Abad, Stabilised carbon in subsoil horizons is located in spatially distinct parts of the soil profile, Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 41, 2, pp. 256-261, (2009); Chan, Kwong Yin, Evaluating mustard extracts for earthworm sampling, Pedobiologia, 45, 3, pp. 272-278, (2001)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09291393","","ASECF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021357963"

Both patterns of historical (approximately 4000 B.C. - 2000 A.D.) and recent (1990-2005) deforestation were explored and compared. The study uses location analysis, combining spatially explicit global databases of deforestation with variables hypothesized to relate to deforestation (e.g. rural livestock density, cost-distance). The results show that historical and recent deforestation show similar patterns when plotted against the selected variables suggesting the relations to be empirical. The strongest relations were between deforestation and rural population density, cost-distance and crop suitability respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that agricultural expansion was the largest direct cause of deforestation historically and it continues to be the largest direct cause today. While crop suitability showed a strong correlation with deforestation, pasture suitability showed no correlation. The study accordingly compares contemporary deforestation in the tropical domain against economic development (approximated by a combination of GDP value and growth rate) which resulted in a reproduction of the deforestation pattern predicted by the forest transition curve. In view of the apparent empirical relation, the variables which relate to deforestation in this study are expected to have predictive power to identify locations of likely future deforestation. To illustrate the application value of this analysis, the deforestation risk in African protected forest was assessed. This assessment revealed that protected areas are found on locations with below average pressure and the pressures vary greatly in the different regions. The findings underline the importance of considering national circumstances to understand the government's efforts to manage its forests sustainably and contribute to international mitigation by reducing forest-related emissions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Correlation; Deforestation; Global Analysis; Historical Trend Analysis; Socio-economic Drivers; Agricultural Extension; Correlation; Deforestation; Economic Development; Forest Management; Spatial Analysis; Trend Analysis","agricultural extension; correlation; deforestation; economic development; forest management; spatial analysis; trend analysis","","","The authors would like to thank Kenneth MacDicken for his guidance and for reviewing the article.

Numerous processes drive the global spatial distribution of P in agricultural soils, but their relative roles remain unclear. Here, we combined several global data sets describing these drivers with a soil P dynamics model to simulate the distribution of P in agricultural soils and to assess the contributions of the different drivers at the global scale. We analysed both the labile inorganic P (P<inf>ILAB</inf>), a proxy of the pool involved in plant nutrition and the total soil P (P<inf>TOT</inf>). We found that the soil biogeochemical background corresponding to P inherited from natural soils at the conversion to agriculture (BIOG) and farming practices (FARM) were the main drivers of the spatial variability in cropland soil P content but that their contribution varied between P<inf>TOT</inf> vs. P<inf>ILAB</inf>. When the spatial variability was computed between grid cells at half-degree resolution, we found that almost all of the P<inf>TOT</inf> spatial variability could be explained by BIOG, while BIOG and FARM explained 38% and 63% of P<inf>ILAB</inf> spatial variability, respectively. Our work also showed that the driver contribution was sensitive to the spatial scale characterizing the variability (grid cell vs. continent) and to the region of interest (global vs. tropics for instance). In particular, the heterogeneity of farming practices between continents was large enough to make FARM contribute to the variability in P<inf>TOT</inf> at that scale. We thus demonstrated how the different drivers were combined to explain the global distribution of agricultural soil P. Our study is also a promising approach to investigate the potential effect of P as a limiting factor for agroecosystems at the global scale. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Soils; Biogeochemical Cycles; Global Scale; Modelling; Phosphorus; Phosphorus; Phosphorus; Soil; Agricultural Ecosystem; Agricultural Soil; Biogeochemical Cycle; Farming System; Global Change; Phosphorus; Spatial Variation; Soil; Agriculture; Chemistry; Crop; Plant; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Phosphorus; Plants; Soil","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural soil; biogeochemical cycle; farming system; global change; phosphorus; spatial variation; soil; agriculture; chemistry; crop; plant; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Phosphorus; Plants; Soil","","phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Phosphorus; Soil","This research was supported by the ‘Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique’ (INRA) and the Environnement et Agronomie (EA) division.

Martin, Department of Space, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden","While we know that deforestation in the tropics is increasingly driven by commercial agriculture, most tropical countries still lack recent and spatially-explicit assessments of the relative importance of pasture and cropland expansion in causing forest loss. Here we present a spatially explicit quantification of the extent to which cultivated land and grassland expanded at the expense of forests across Latin America in 2001-2011, by combining two -state-ofthe-art- global datasets (Global Forest Change forest loss and GlobeLand30-2010 land cover). We further evaluate some of the limitations and challenges in doing this. We find that this approach does capture some of the major patterns of land cover following deforestation, with GlobeLand30-2010-s Grassland class (which we interpret as pasture) being the most common land cover replacing forests across Latin America. However, our analysis also reveals some major limitations to combining these land cover datasets for quantifying pasture and cropland expansion into forest. First, a simple one-to-one translation between GlobeLand30-2010-s Cultivated land and Grassland classes into cropland and pasture respectively, should not be made without caution, as GlobeLand30-2010 defines its Cultivated land to include some pastures. Comparisons with the TerraClass dataset over the Brazilian Amazon and with previous literature indicates that Cultivated land in GlobeLand30-2010 includes notable amounts of pasture and other vegetation (e.g. in Paraguay and the Brazilian Amazon). This further suggests that the approach taken here generally leads to an underestimation (of up to ~60%) of the role of pasture in replacing forest. Second, a large share (~33%) of the Global Forest Change forest loss is found to still be forest according to GlobeLand30-2010 and our analysis suggests that the accuracy of the combined datasets, especially for areas with heterogeneous land cover and/or small-scale forest loss, is still too poor for deriving accurate quantifications of land cover following forest loss. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cropland; Cultivated Land; Deforestation; Forest; Grassland; Human; Human Cell; Paraguay; Pasture; Quantitative Study; Vegetation; Agriculture; Brazil; Comparative Study; Environmental Protection; Geographic Mapping; Growth, Development And Aging; Information Processing; South And Central America; Statistics And Numerical Data; Tree; Trends; Agriculture; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Datasets As Topic; Forests; Geographic Mapping; Grassland; Humans; Latin America; Trees","cropland; cultivated land; deforestation; forest; grassland; human; human cell; Paraguay; pasture; quantitative study; vegetation; agriculture; Brazil; comparative study; environmental protection; geographic mapping; growth, development and aging; information processing; South and Central America; statistics and numerical data; tree; trends; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Datasets as Topic; Forests; Geographic Mapping; Grassland; Humans; Latin America; Trees","","","","DeFries, Ruth S., Deforestation driven by urban population growth and agricultural trade in the twenty-first century, Nature Geoscience, 3, 3, pp. 178-181, (2010); Gibbs, Holly K., Tropical forests were the primary sources of new agricultural land in the 1980s and 1990s, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 107, 38, pp. 16732-16737, (2010); Gasparri, Nestor Ignacio, The Coupling of South American Soybean and Cattle Production Frontiers: New Challenges for Conservation Policy and Land Change Science, Conservation Letters, 8, 4, pp. 290-298, (2015); Rudel, Thomas K., Changing drivers of deforestation and new opportunities for conservation, Conservation Biology, 23, 6, pp. 1396-1405, (2009); Henders, Sabine, Trading forests: Land-use change and carbon emissions embodied in production and exports of forest-risk commodities, Environmental Research Letters, 10, 12, (2015); Lambin, Eric F., Global land use change, economic globalization, and the looming land scarcity, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 108, 9, pp. 3465-3472, (2011); Liu, Jianguo, Framing sustainability in a telecoupled world, Ecology and Society, 18, 2, (2013); Lambin, Eric F., Effectiveness and synergies of policy instruments for land use governance in tropical regions, Global Environmental Change, 28, 1, pp. 129-140, (2014); Newton, Peter, Enhancing the sustainability of commodity supply chains in tropical forest and agricultural landscapes, Global Environmental Change, 23, 6, pp. 1761-1772, (2013); Supply Chain Transparency Network State of Play, (2017)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","28704510","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85024493131"

The hydrologic soil group (HSG), land use/cover, hydrologic surface condition and antecedent moisture condition jointly determine the CN value. This study aims to update the previous global CN map using the recently available geospatial remote sensing data. Based on the conventional United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and National Engineering Handbook Section 4 (NEH-4) standard lookup tables, the newly derived CN map utilizes the latest Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover and the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) soil data to investigate the current flood potential of the global land surface. The results show that the new CN map outperforms the previous one in detecting China’s flood event locations with an improvement in the ratio of the averaged CN value for flood events to the averaged CN value for the whole land area of China. The new CN map reveals the effects of land surface change on hydrological conditions in the 2000s. Based on the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) data and the gaugecombined Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) product, global surface runoff (April 2015-March 2016, 0.1°×0.1°) is estimated with the new CN map.

Using a comprehensive global database and parsimonious modelling, we evaluate the impact of anthropogenic soil erosion on C fluxes between the Earth's surface and atmosphere from the onset of agriculture to the present day. We find that agricultural erosion represents a very large and transient perturbation to the C cycle and has induced a cumulative net uptake of 78 ± 22 Pg C in terrestrial ecosystems during the period 6000 BC to AD 2015. This erosion-induced soil organic C sink is estimated to have offset 37 ± 10% of previously recognized C emissions resulting from ALCC. We estimate that rates of C burial have increased by a factor of 4.6 since AD 1850. Thus, current assessments may significantly overestimate both past and future anthropogenic emissions from the land. Given that ALCC is the most uncertain component of the global C budget and that there is a strong connection between ALCC and erosion, an explicit representation of erosion and burial processes is essential to fully understand the impact of human activities on the net soil-atmosphere C exchange. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Emission; Atmosphere-biosphere Interaction; Carbon Emission; Carbon Flux; Climate Change; Human Activity; Land Cover; Soil Carbon; Soil Erosion; Soil Organic Matter","agricultural emission; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon emission; carbon flux; climate change; human activity; land cover; soil carbon; soil erosion; soil organic matter","","","","HOUGHTON, R.

Here we provide a plausible breakdown of global agricultural and nutrient production by farm size, and also study the associations between farm size, agricultural diversity, and nutrient production. This analysis is crucial to design interventions that might be appropriately targeted to promote healthy diets and ecosystems in the face of population growth, urbanisation, and climate change. Methods We used existing spatially-explicit global datasets to estimate the production levels of 41 major crops, seven livestock, and 14 aquaculture and fish products. From overall production estimates, we estimated the production of vitamin A, vitamin B<inf>12</inf>, folate, iron, zinc, calcium, calories, and protein. We also estimated the relative contribution of farms of different sizes to the production of different agricultural commodities and associated nutrients, as well as how the diversity of food production based on the number of different products grown per geographic pixel and distribution of products within this pixel (Shannon diversity index [H]) changes with different farm sizes. Findings Globally, small and medium farms (≤50 ha) produce 51–77% of nearly all commodities and nutrients examined here. However, important regional differences exist. Large farms (>50 ha) dominate production in North America, South America, and Australia and New Zealand. In these regions, large farms contribute between 75% and 100% of all cereal, livestock, and fruit production, and the pattern is similar for other commodity groups. By contrast, small farms (≤20 ha) produce more than 75% of most food commodities in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, south Asia, and China. In Europe, west Asia and north Africa, and central America, medium-size farms (20–50 ha) also contribute substantially to the production of most food commodities. Very small farms (≤2 ha) are important and have local significance in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, and south Asia, where they contribute to about 30% of most food commodities. The majority of vegetables (81%), roots and tubers (72%), pulses (67%), fruits (66%), fish and livestock products (60%), and cereals (56%) are produced in diverse landscapes (H>1·5). Similarly, the majority of global micronutrients (53–81%) and protein (57%) are also produced in more diverse agricultural landscapes (H>1·5). By contrast, the majority of sugar (73%) and oil crops (57%) are produced in less diverse ones (H≤1·5), which also account for the majority of global calorie production (56%). The diversity of agricultural and nutrient production diminishes as farm size increases. However, areas of the world with higher agricultural diversity produce more nutrients, irrespective of farm size. Interpretation Our results show that farm size and diversity of agricultural production vary substantially across regions and are key structural determinants of food and nutrient production that need to be considered in plans to meet social, economic, and environmental targets. At the global level, both small and large farms have key roles in food and nutrition security. Efforts to maintain production diversity as farm sizes increase seem to be necessary to maintain the production of diverse nutrients and viable, multifunctional, sustainable landscapes.

Understanding its implications for natural and cultivated ecosystems is pivotal in a context of high population growth and mainly agriculture-based livelihoods. However, efforts to model processes at the land–atmosphere interface are hindered, particularly when the multi-decadal timescale is targeted, as climatic data are scarce, largely incomplete and often unreliable. This study presents the generation of a long-term, high-temporal resolution, multivariate local climatic data set for Niamey, Central Sahel. The continuous series spans the period 1950–2009 at a 30-min timescale and includes ground station-based meteorological variables (precipitation, air temperature, relative and specific humidity, air pressure, wind speed, downwelling long- and short-wave radiation) as well as process-modelled surface fluxes (upwelling long- and short-wave radiation, latent, sensible and soil heat fluxes and surface temperature). A combination of complementary techniques (linear/spline regressions, a multivariate analogue method, artificial neural networks and recursive gap filling) was used to reconstruct missing meteorological data. The complete surface energy budget was then obtained for two dominant land cover types, fallow bush and millet, by applying the meteorological forcing data set to a finely field-calibrated land surface model. Uncertainty in reconstructed data was expressed by means of a stochastic ensemble of plausible historical time series. Climatological statistics were computed at sub-daily to decadal timescales and compared with local, regional and global data sets such as CRU and ERA-Interim. The reconstructed precipitation statistics, ∼1 °C increase in mean annual temperature from 1950 to 2009, and mean diurnal and annual cycles for all variables were in good agreement with previous studies. The new data set, denoted NAD (Niamey Airport-derived set) and publicly available, can be used to investigate the water and energy cycles in Central Sahel, while the methodology can be applied to reconstruct series at other stations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cru; Era-40; Era-interim; Fallow Savannah; Gap Filling; Millet; Niamey Airport Station; Synoptic Data; Atmospheric Pressure; Atmospheric Temperature; Budget Control; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Meteorology; Neural Networks; Stochastic Systems; Surface Measurement; Wind; Airport Station; Era Interims; Era-40; Fallow Savannah; Gap Filling; Millet; Synoptic Data; Population Statistics; Climate Variation; Climatology; Data Set; Energy Budget; Land Surface; Meteorology; Modeling; Savanna; Synoptic Meteorology; Niamey [niger]; Niger [west Africa]; Sahel [sub-saharan Africa]","Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Budget control; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Meteorology; Neural networks; Stochastic systems; Surface measurement; Wind; Airport station; Era interims; ERA-40; Fallow savannah; Gap filling; Millet; Synoptic data; Population statistics; climate variation; climatology; data set; energy budget; land surface; meteorology; modeling; savanna; synoptic meteorology; Niamey [Niger]; Niger [West Africa]; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]","","","","Crop Evapotranspiration Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements, (1998); Balme, Maud, Assessing the water balance in the Sahel: Impact of small scale rainfall variability on runoff.

Profile depth functions have been used to represent the vertical distribution of soil attributes and to predict them at continuous depths. This paper proposes a new model to predict pH for a whole soil profile. Soil properties including pH are often similar within the plow layer from mixing during tillage and other agricultural operations. Similarly, soil pH below the root zone tends to be uniform due to low disturbance, leaving a transition zone from the bottom of the tillage layer to the bottom of the root zone due to depth-dependent root density and related soil processes. Keeping this physical description of agricultural field soil profile in mind, a closed form equation (model) was developed similar to a sigmoid curve. The model has 4 parameters including 1) soil pH at the top of a soil profile, 2) soil pH at the bottom of a soil profile, 3) hillslope parameter representing steepness of the curve that is determined by the length of the root zone, and 4) inflection point representing almost the midpoint of the transition zone or root zone. A total of 32 soil cores down to about 1.1 m depths were collected from an agricultural field of Macdonald farm, McGill University. The sub-samples were taken at every 10 cm and analyzed for soil pH in soil: water suspension in the laboratory. The measured pH was used to test the fitting performance of the sigmoid model. Additionally, a global dataset with 432 profiles with various soil classes, drainage types, land use, and altitude was also used to test the generality of the new model. The performance of this model was compared with the results of the commonly used 3rd order polynomial regression function and the equal-area quadratic spline function. Good performance of the sigmoid model with explicit physical explanation showed promise in predicting soil pH at depths. The spline function had the highest accuracy but lacked a general trend in its shape and parameters. The polynomial function had good accuracy and displayed a non-monotonic trend, which can also be used as a substitute for some profiles with complex variability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3d Variability; Agricultural Soil; Depth Function; Digital Soil Mapping; Sigmoid Model; Soil Ph; Agricultural Machinery; Agriculture; Forecasting; Interpolation; Land Use; Soil Surveys; Soils; Statistical Tests; 3d Variability; Agricultural Soils; Digital Soil Mappings; Sigmoid Model; Soil Ph; Soil Testing","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Forecasting; Interpolation; Land use; Soil surveys; Soils; Statistical tests; 3D variability; Agricultural soils; Digital soil mappings; Sigmoid model; Soil pH; Soil testing","","","The project was funded by Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) ( RGPIN-2014-04100 ) of Canada.

This paper provides a method for constructing a new historical global nitrogen fertilizer application map (0.5° × 0.5° resolution) for the period 1961-2010 based on country-specific information from Food and Agriculture Organization statistics (FAOSTAT) and various global datasets. This new map incorporates the fraction of NH<inf>4</inf>+ (and NO<inf>3</inf>) in N fertilizer inputs by utilizing fertilizer species information in FAOSTAT, in which species can be categorized as NH<inf>4</inf>+and/or NO<inf>3</inf>-forming N fertilizers. During data processing, we applied a statistical data imputation method for the missing data (19ĝ of national N fertilizer consumption) in FAOSTAT. The multiple imputation method enabled us to fill gaps in the time-series data using plausible values using covariates information (year, population, GDP, and crop area). After the imputation, we downscaled the national consumption data to a gridded cropland map. Also, we applied the multiple imputation method to the available chemical fertilizer species consumption, allowing for the estimation of the NH<inf>4</inf>+/NO<inf>3</inf> ratio in national fertilizer consumption. In this study, the synthetic N fertilizer inputs in 2000 showed a general consistency with the existing N fertilizer map (Potter et al., 2010) in relation to the ranges of N fertilizer inputs. Globally, the estimated N fertilizer inputs based on the sum of filled data increased from 15 to 110Tg-N during 1961-2010. On the other hand, the global NO<inf>3</inf> input started to decline after the late 1980s and the fraction of NO<inf>3</inf> in global N fertilizer decreased consistently from 35 to 13% over a 50-year period. NH<inf>4</inf>+-forming fertilizers are dominant in most countries; however, the NH<inf>4</inf>+NO<inf>3</inf> ratio in N fertilizer inputs shows clear differences temporally and geographically. This new map can be utilized as input data to global model studies and bring new insights for the assessment of historical terrestrial N cycling changes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Bouwman, Lex Felix, Direct emission of nitrous oxide from agricultural soils, Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 46, 1, pp. 53-70, (1996); Bouwman, Lex Felix, Estimation of global NH3 volatilization loss from synthetic fertilizers and animal manure applied to arable lands and grasslands, Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 16, 2, pp. 1-15, (2002); Bouwman, Lex Felix, Exploring global changes in nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in agriculture induced by livestock production over the 1900-2050 period, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110, 52, pp. 20882-20887, (2013); Conant, Richard Theodore, Patterns and trends in nitrogen use and nitrogen recovery efficiency in world agriculture, Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 27, 2, pp. 558-566, (2013); DAVIDSON, ERIC A., The contribution of manure and fertilizer nitrogen to atmospheric nitrous oxide since 1860, Nature Geoscience, 2, 9, pp. 659-662, (2009); DAVIDSON, ERIC A., Representative concentration pathways and mitigation scenarios for nitrous oxide, Environmental Research Letters, 7, 2, (2012); de Vries, Wim H., Assessing planetary and regional nitrogen boundaries related to food security and adverse environmental impacts, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 5, 3-4, pp. 392-402, (2013); Erisman, Jan Willem, How a century of ammonia synthesis changed the world, Nature Geoscience, 1, 10, pp. 636-639, (2008); Evans, Mariah D.R., Family scholarly culture and educational success: Books and schooling in 27 nations, Research in Social Stratification and Mobility, 28, 2, pp. 171-197, (2010); Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, (2006)","","Copernicus GmbH info@copernicus.org","","","","","","18663516; 18663508","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013414487"

But its determinants and their relative importance are still a matter of debate, especially because most regional and global analyses have not considered the influence of agricultural practices. More information is urgently needed regarding how human practices influence vegetation structure. Here we focused in Central Africa, a region still subjected to traditional agricultural practices with a clear vegetation gradient. Using remote sensing data and global databases, we calibrated a Random Forest model to correlatively link tree cover with climatic, edaphic, fire and agricultural practices data. We showed that annual rainfall and accumulated water deficit were the main drivers of the distribution of tree cover and vegetation classes (defined by the modes of tree cover density), but agricultural practices, especially pastoralism, were also important in determining tree cover. We simulated future tree cover with our model using different scenarios of climate and land-use (agriculture and population) changes. Our simulations suggest that tree cover may respond differently regarding the type of scenarios, but land-use change was an important driver of vegetation change even able to counterbalance the effect of climate change in Central Africa. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calibration; Central Africa; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Geography; Physiology; Tree; Africa, Central; Calibration; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Geography; Trees","calibration; Central Africa; climate change; computer simulation; geography; physiology; tree; Africa, Central; Calibration; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Geography; Trees","","","This study was financially supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR, 2008-29489-62704-33) through the ErA Net BiodivERsA CoForChange project, CNRS, CIRAD and EPHE.

For the Caatinga seasonally dry forests in Northeast Brazil, recent studies revealed both woody vegetation loss and (re-)gain. A conclusive analysis of land cover and landscape diversity changes is still lacking. To fill this gap, we surveyed pattern-process relationships for the Caatinga phytogeographical domain on different spatial levels for the years 2001–2012 from MODIS land cover data. By a landscape pattern analysis, a set of five landscape metrics was calculated using FRAGSTATS. The spatio-temporal results revealed a general decrease of fragmentation and diversity. The savanna class which comprises also Caatinga dry forests covered large parts of the landscape and gained considerably, whereas other vegetation classes decreased. The distribution of the low vegetated shrublands and grasslands implied degradation risks, in particular at the São Fransisco River valley. Large-scaled agriculture was found in the proximity to water reservoirs in the lowlands, which led to local increases of the landscape's diversity. We quantified both gains and losses of woody vegetation with a notable net gain of 6.7% of the study area. Main changes may be attributed to socio-economic shifts from local to large-scaled agriculture and water infrastructural activities. Overall, our study shows that a multi-temporal, global dataset along with a landscape pattern analysis provides valuable contributions to landscape research and for detecting land cover and landscape diversity changes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Degradation; Desertification; Landscape Ecology; Landscape Metrics; Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests; Shannon Diversity Index; Biodiversity; Deforestation; Desertification; Diversity Index; Dry Forest; Environmental Degradation; Land Use Change; Landscape Change; Modis; Phytogeography; Socioeconomic Impact; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Vegetation Dynamics; Brazil; Sao Francisco Valley","biodiversity; deforestation; desertification; diversity index; dry forest; environmental degradation; land use change; landscape change; MODIS; phytogeography; socioeconomic impact; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation dynamics; Brazil; Sao Francisco Valley","","","","Aide, T.

Here, we present a data-fusion approach that integrates satellite-based insolation product (8 km) from an Indian geostationary satellite (Kalpana-1) sensor (VHRR; Very High Resolution Radiometer) and high-resolution (~ 5 km) short-range weather forecast into an FAO56 model based on the classical Penman–Monteith (P-M) formulation. Five year (2009–2013) mean monthly estimates from the daily ET<inf>0</inf> product over the Indian landmass were found to vary between 10 and 350 mm. It increased from January to May (70–350 mm), followed by a decrease to reach the lowest in November (10–140 mm), thus typically showing unimodal distribution. The comparison of daily space-based and station-based estimates (at six ground stations) produced a root mean square deviation (RMSD) ranging from 21% to 38% for 977 paired data sets with the correlation coefficient (r) varying from 0.32 to 0.82. The error was reduced from 25% to 10% with an increase in ‘r’ from 0.43 to 0.98 for daily to 10 day summation period. Spatial grid-to-grid comparison of monthly ET<inf>0</inf> estimates with Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) potential evapotranspiration (PET) showed RMSD within a range of 1.4–18.4% for most of the months, except for two. Further ET<inf>0</inf> analysis over normal and drought years showed that it could be used for comprehensive drought assessment with other existing indicators. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Geostationary Satellites; Sensor Data Fusion; Agricultural Drought; Correlation Coefficient; Global Data Assimilation System; Potential Evapotranspiration; Reference Evapotranspiration; Root Mean Square Deviations; Satellite Based Observations; Unimodal Distribution; Weather Forecasting; Evapotranspiration; Geostationary Satellite; Image Resolution; Penman-monteith Equation; Real Time; Satellite Data; India","Agriculture; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Geostationary satellites; Sensor data fusion; Agricultural drought; Correlation coefficient; Global data assimilation system; Potential evapotranspiration; Reference evapotranspiration; Root mean square deviations; Satellite based observations; Unimodal distribution; Weather forecasting; evapotranspiration; geostationary satellite; image resolution; Penman-Monteith equation; real time; satellite data; India","","","","Regional Advection Perturbations in an Irrigated Desert Rapid Impacts on Evapotranspiration, (1999); Fao Rome, (1998); Anderson, Martha C., A climatological study of evapotranspiration and moisture stress across the continental United States based on thermal remote sensing: 1.

This study introduces a drought assessment framework of standardized in- dices in Pampanga (Philippines), Solo (Indonesia), and Chao Phraya (Thailand) basins. We used three ex- isting and developed two new standardized indices to characterize meteorological, agricultural, hydrolog- ical and socio-economic droughts. We constructed a 15-arcsec (about 0.45-km) grid block-wise TOP (BTOP) model with multipurpose dam operation at individual river basin using global datasets and cali- brated BTOP models with daily river discharge and dam inflow data. The simulated irrigated area is also compared with historical drought damages at each river basin. The calibrated BTOP models were run with bias-corrected MRI-AGCM3.2S precipitation to evaluate droughts under climate change. The calcu- lated standardized indices show similar drought tim- ing of the 1982-1983, 1987-1988, 1991-1992, 1997-1998 and 2002-2003 droughts across three river basins. In addition, the timing of these droughts coincides with historical El Nin˜ o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle events. The projected future climates demonstrate a variability of dam infl and drought severities be- tween four cases of the worst (RCP8.5) climate change scenario. We conclude that standardized indices are useful tools to characterize droughts at water cycle components. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Btop Model; Climate Change; Drought; Standardized Indices; Atmospheric Pressure; Climate Models; Drought; Rivers; Watersheds; Climate Change Scenarios; Drought Severity; Future Climate; Global Datasets; River Discharge; Socio-economics; Southern Oscillation; Standardized Indices; Climate Change","Atmospheric pressure; Climate models; Drought; Rivers; Watersheds; Climate change scenarios; Drought severity; Future climate; Global datasets; River discharge; Socio-economics; Southern oscillation; Standardized indices; Climate change","","","","undefined; Summary for Policymakers of Climate Change 2007 the Physical Science Basis Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (2014); An Objective Approach to Definitions and Investigations of Continental Hydrologic Droughts, (1967); Smakhtin, Vladimir U., Droughts: The impact of semantics and perceptions, Water Policy, 10, 2, pp. 131-143, (2008); Smakhtin, Vladimir U., Low flow hydrology: A review, Journal of Hydrology, 240, 3-4, pp. 147-186, (2001); Developments in Water Science, (2004); Mishra, Ashok Kumar, A review of drought concepts, Journal of Hydrology, 391, 1-2, pp. 202-216, (2010); Dai, Aiguo, Drought under global warming: A review, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, 2, 1, pp. 45-65, (2011); Drought Past Problems and Future Scenarios, (2011); van Dijk, Albert I.J.M.V., The Millennium Drought in southeast Australia (2001-2009): Natural and human causes and implications for water resources, ecosystems, economy, and society, Water Resources Research, 49, 2, pp. 1040-1057, (2013)","","Fuji Technology Press jaciii@fujipress.jp","","","","","","18812473; 18838030","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006515719"

The test study site was the Rokel-Seli River catchment, Sierra Leone, West Africa. Study focus We propose a simple, transferable water assessment framework that allows the use of global climate datasets in the assessment of water availability and crop demand in data scarce catchments. In this study, we apply the assessment framework to the catchment of the Rokel-Seli River in Sierra Leone to investigate the capabilities of global datasets complemented with limited historical data in estimating water resources of a river basin facing rising demands from large scale agricultural water withdrawals. We demonstrate how short term river flow records can be extended using a lumped hydrological model, and then use a crop water demand model to generate irrigation water demands for a large irrigated biofuels scheme abstracting from the river. The results of using several different global datasets to drive the assessment framework are compared and the performance evaluated against observed rain and flow gauge records. New hydrological insights We find that the hydrological model capably simulates both low and high flows satisfactorily, and that all the input datasets consistently produce similar results for water withdrawal scenarios. The proposed framework is successfully applied to assess the variability of flows available for abstraction against agricultural demand. The assessment framework conclusions are robust despite the different input datasets and calibration scenarios tested, and can be extended to include other global input datasets. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cropwat; Global Climate Data; Hydrological Model; Ihacres; Water Resources Assessment Framework","","","","","Executive Summary of the Environmental Social and Health Impact Assessment Tunis, (2010); Akiwumi, Fenda A., Conjunctive water use in an African river basin: a case study in poor planning, 240, pp. 495-502, (1997); Hydrol Earth Syst Sci Discuss, (2016); Bossio, Deborah A., Water implications of foreign direct investment in Ethiopia's agricultural sector, Water Alternatives, 5, 2, pp. 223-242, (2012); Evans, Jason P., Development of a simple, catchment-scale, rainfall-evapotranspiration-runoff model, Environmental Modelling and Software, 13, 3-4, pp. 385-393, (1998); Crop Evapotranspiration Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements, (1998); Food and Agriculture Organisation, (2014); Long Term Mean Monthly Discharges and Annual Characteristics of Grdc Station Global Runoff Data Centre, (2011); Guzinski, Radoslaw, Enabling the use of earth observation data for integrated water resource management in africa with the water observation and information system, Remote Sensing, 6, 8, pp. 7819-7839, (2014); Hijmans, Robert J., Very high resolution interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas, International Journal of Climatology, 25, 15, pp. 1965-1978, (2005)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22145818","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994032262"

The aim of this study was to understand potential impacts on environmental sustainability of agricultural intensification close to a protected forest area of the Amazon under climate change. We carried out a WFA to calculate the water footprint (WF) related to soybean production, Glycine max, to understand the sustainability of the WF in the Tapajós river basin, a region in the Brazilian Amazon with large expansion and intensification of soybean. Based on global datasets, environmental hotspots — potentially unsustainable WF areas — were identified and spatially plotted in both baseline scenario (2010) and projection into 2050 through the use of a land-use change scenario that includes climate change effects. Results show green and grey WF values in 2050 increased by 304% and 268%, respectively. More than one-third of the watersheds doubled their grey WF in 2050. Soybean production in 2010 lies within sustainability limits. However, current soybean expansion and intensification trends lead to large impacts in relation to water pollution and water use, affecting protected areas. Areas not impacted in terms of water pollution dropped by 20.6% in 2050 for the whole catchment, while unsustainability increased 8.1%. Management practices such as water consumption regulations to stimulate efficient water use, reduction of crop water use and evapotranspiration, and optimal fertiliser application control could be key factors in achieving sustainability within a river basin. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deforestation; Land Use Change; Soybean Production; Sustainability; Water Use; Amino Acids; Catchments; Crops; Deforestation; Environmental Protection; Expansion; Fertilizers; Land Use; Nitrogen Fixation; River Pollution; Sustainable Development; Water Conservation; Water Resources; Water Supply; Watersheds; Agricultural Expansion; Agricultural Intensification; Climate Change Scenarios; Environmental Sustainability; Land-use Change; Management Practices; Soybean Production; Water Use; Climate Change; Agricultural Intensification; Climate Change; Crop Production; Deforestation; Land Use Change; Management Practice; Soybean; Sustainability; Water Footprint; Water Use; Agricultural Expansion; Agricultural Management; Article; Brazil; Catchment; Environmental Impact Assessment; Environmental Sustainability; Evapotranspiration; Fertilizer Application; Forest; Land Use; Priority Journal; River Basin; Water Footprint Assessment; Water Pollution; Water Supply; Watershed; Amazon River; Glycine Max","Amino acids; Catchments; Crops; Deforestation; Environmental protection; Expansion; Fertilizers; Land use; Nitrogen fixation; River pollution; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water resources; Water supply; Watersheds; Agricultural expansion; Agricultural intensification; Climate change scenarios; Environmental sustainability; Land-use change; Management practices; Soybean production; Water use; Climate change; agricultural intensification; climate change; crop production; deforestation; land use change; management practice; soybean; sustainability; water footprint; water use; agricultural expansion; agricultural management; Article; Brazil; catchment; environmental impact assessment; environmental sustainability; evapotranspiration; fertilizer application; forest; land use; priority journal; river basin; water footprint assessment; water pollution; water supply; watershed; Amazon River; Glycine max","","","The research leading to these results has received partial funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 283093 \u2013 the Role Of Biodiversity In climate change mitigatioN (ROBIN).","Allan, J.

In this study, we assessed the universality of the relationships between crop LAI and remotely sensed Vegetation Indices (VIs). We first compiled a global dataset of 1459 in situ quality-controlled crop LAI measurements and collected Landsat satellite images to derive five different VIs including Simple Ratio (SR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), two versions of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI and EVI2), and Green Chlorophyll Index (CI<inf>Green</inf>). Based on this dataset, we developed global LAI-VI relationships for each crop type and VI using symbolic regression and Theil-Sen (TS) robust estimator. Results suggest that the global LAI-VI relationships are statistically significant, crop-specific, and mostly non-linear. These relationships explain more than half of the total variance in ground LAI observations (R2 > 0.5), and provide LAI estimates with RMSE below 1.2 m2/m2. Among the five VIs, EVI/EVI2 are the most effective, and the crop-specific LAI-EVI and LAI-EVI2 relationships constructed by TS, are robust when tested by three independent validation datasets of varied spatial scales. While the heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes leads to a diverse set of local LAI-VI relationships, the relationships provided here represent global universality on an average basis, allowing the generation of large-scale spatial-explicit LAI maps. This study contributes to the operationalization of large-area crop modeling and, by extension, has relevance to both fundamental and applied agroecosystem research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Agroecosystem Modeling; Lai; Landsat; Vegetation Index; Agriculture; Crops; Ecosystems; Plants (botany); Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery; Agricultural Landscapes; Agro-ecosystem Modeling; Enhanced Vegetation Index; Landsat; Landsat Satellite Images; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Symbolic Regression; Vegetation Index; Vegetation","Agriculture; Crops; Ecosystems; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Agricultural landscapes; Agro-ecosystem modeling; Enhanced vegetation index; LANDSAT; LANDSAT satellite images; Normalized difference vegetation index; Symbolic regression; Vegetation index; Vegetation","","","","Watson, D.

Bhutan’s complex, often high-altitude terrain and the severe impact of the Indian summer monsoon leads to a strong exposure of the countries’ key economic sectors (agriculture, forestry, hydropower generation and tourism) to climatic changes. Climate change also threatens Bhutan’s vast biodiversity and increases the likelihood of natural hazards (e.g. glacier lake outburst floods, flash floods, droughts and forest fires). A better understanding of Bhutan’s climate and its variability, as well as observed and possible climate impacts, will help in improving the handling of regional social, economic and ecologic challenges not limited to the Himalayas. Only a few climatological studies exist for the eastern Himalayas. They mainly focus on adaptation to immediate threats by glacier lake outbursts. In contrast, this paper (1) investigates the average spatial and inner-annual diversity of the air temperature regime of Bhutan, based on local meteorological observations, (2) discusses past temperature variability, based on global datasets, and (3) relates effects of observed warming to water availability, hydropower development, natural hazards, forests, biodiversity, agriculture, human health and tourism in the Bhutan Himalayas. Results indicate a large spatial and temporal temperature variability within Bhutan and considerably increasing temperatures especially over recent decades.

The reshaping and migration northwards of bioclimatic zones may offer opportunities for agricultural development in western and central Siberia. However, the bioclimatic vegetation models currently employed for projections still do not consider soil fertility, in spite of this being highly critical for plant growth. In the present study, we surveyed the phosphorus (P) status in the south-west of Siberia where soils have developed on loess parent material. We selected six sites differing in pedoclimatic conditions and the soil was sampled at different depths down to 1ĝ€m in aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> L.) forest as well as in grassland areas. The P status was assessed by conventional methods and by isotope dilution kinetics. We found that P concentrations and stocks, as well as their distribution through the soil profile, were fairly homogeneous on the regional scale studied, although there were some differences between sites (particularly in organic P). The young age of the soils, together with slow kinetics of soil formation processes have probably not yet resulted in a sufficiently wide range of soil physico-chemical conditions to observe a more diverging P status. The comparison of our data set with similar vegetation contexts on the global scale revealed that the soils of south-western Siberia, and more generally of northern Eurasia, often have (very) high levels of total, organic and inorganic P. The amount of plant-available P in topsoils, estimated by the isotopically exchangeable phosphate ions, was not particularly high but was intermediate on the global scale. However, large stocks of plant-available P are stored in subsurface layers which currently have low fine-root exploration intensities. These results suggest that the P resource is unlikely to constrain vegetation growth and agricultural development under the present conditions or in the near future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Development; Concentration (composition); Data Set; Deciduous Forest; Ecological Modeling; Global Perspective; Grassland; Growth Response; Loess; Phosphorus; Reaction Kinetics; Soil Fertility; Soil Nutrient; Soil Profile; Topsoil; Siberia; Populus Tremula","agricultural development; concentration (composition); data set; deciduous forest; ecological modeling; global perspective; grassland; growth response; loess; phosphorus; reaction kinetics; soil fertility; soil nutrient; soil profile; topsoil; Siberia; Populus tremula","","","","Achat, David Ludovick, Evaluation of the phosphorus status of P-deficient podzols in temperate pine stands: Combining isotopic dilution and extraction methods, Biogeochemistry, 92, 3, pp. 183-200, (2009); Achat, David Ludovick, Predicting available phosphate ions from physical-chemical soil properties in acidic sandy soils under pine forests, Journal of Soils and Sediments, 11, 3, pp. 452-466, (2011); Achat, David Ludovick, Drying-induced changes in phosphorus status of soils with contrasting soil organic matter contents - Implications for laboratory approaches, Geoderma, 187-188, pp. 41-48, (2012); Achat, David Ludovick, Phosphorus status of soils from contrasting forested ecosystems in southwestern Siberia: Effects of microbiological and physicochemical properties, Biogeosciences, 10, 2, pp. 733-752, (2013); Achat, David Ludovick, Contributions of microbial and physical-chemical processes to phosphorus availability in Podzols and Arenosols under a temperate forest, Geoderma, 211-212, 1, pp. 18-27, (2013); Achat, David Ludovick, Soil properties controlling inorganic phosphorus availability: general results from a national forest network and a global compilation of the literature, Biogeochemistry, 127, 2-3, pp. 255-272, (2016); Aerts, Rien, The Mineral Nutrition of Wild Plants Revisited: A Re-evaluation of Processes and Patterns, Advances in Ecological Research, 30, C, pp. 1-67, (1999); Recueil De Normes, (1999); Ågren, Göran I., Nutrient limitation on terrestrial plant growth - modeling the interaction between nitrogen and phosphorus, New Phytologist, 194, 4, pp. 953-960, (2012); Augusto, Laurent, Impact of forest tree species on feldspar weathering rates, Geoderma, 96, 3, pp. 215-237, (2000)","","Copernicus GmbH info@copernicus.org","","","","","","17264189; 17264170","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84966340391"

Using a 6-year monitoring of three potato moth species, major crop pests in the tropical Andes, we asked whether the spatiotemporal resolution of temperature data affect the predictions of models of moth performance and distribution. For this, we used three different climatic data sets: (i) the WorldClim dataset (global dataset), (ii) air temperature recorded using data loggers (weather station dataset), and (iii) air crop canopy temperature (microclimate dataset). We developed a statistical procedure to calibrate all datasets to monthly and yearly variation in temperatures, while keeping both spatial and temporal variances (air monthly temperature at 1 km2 for the WorldClim dataset, air hourly temperature for the weather station, and air minute temperature over 250 m radius disks for the microclimate dataset). Then, we computed pest performances based on these three datasets. Results for temperature ranging from 9 to 11°C revealed discrepancies in the simulation outputs in both survival and development rates depending on the spatiotemporal resolution of the temperature dataset. Temperature and simulated pest performances were then combined into multiple linear regression models to compare predicted vs. field data. We used an additional set of study sites to test the ability of the results of our model to be extrapolated over larger scales. Results showed that the model implemented with microclimatic data best predicted observed pest abundances for our study sites, but was less accurate than the global dataset model when performed at larger scales. Our simulations therefore stress the importance to consider different temperature datasets depending on the issue to be solved in order to accurately predict species abundances. In conclusion, keeping in mind that the mismatch between the size of organisms and the scale at which climate data are collected and modeled remains a key issue, temperature dataset selection should be balanced by the desired output spatiotemporal scale for better predicting pest dynamics and developing efficient pest management strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Insects; Landscape; Microclimate; Models; Scale; Temperature; Alfalfa; Altitude; Article; Biological Monitoring; Crop Management; Crop Pest; Lepidoptera; Maize; Microclimate; Nonhuman; Pest Management; Phthorimaea Operculella; Population Abundance; Potato; Prediction; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Species Distribution; Statistical Model; Symmetrischema Tangolias; Tecia Solanivora; Temperature Dependence; Tropics; Validation Process; Vicia Faba","alfalfa; altitude; Article; biological monitoring; crop management; crop pest; Lepidoptera; maize; microclimate; nonhuman; pest management; Phthorimaea operculella; population abundance; potato; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; species distribution; statistical model; Symmetrischema tangolias; Tecia solanivora; temperature dependence; tropics; validation process; Vicia faba","","","","Bastías, Daniel A., Thermal Adaptation: A Theoretical and Empirical Synthesis, pp. 1-302, (2009); Austin, Mike P., Improving species distribution models for climate change studies: Variable selection and scale, Journal of Biogeography, 38, 1, pp. 1-8, (2011); Bennie, Jonathan J., Seeing the woods for the trees - when is microclimate important in species distribution models?, Global Change Biology, 20, 9, pp. 2699-2700, (2014); Bonebrake, Timothy Carlton, Climate heterogeneity modulates impact of warming on tropical insects, Ecology, 93, 3, pp. 449-455, (2012); Brown, James Hemphill, Toward a metabolic theory of ecology, Ecology, 85, 7, pp. 1771-1789, (2004); Buckley, Lauren B., Can terrestrial ectotherms escape the heat of climate change by moving?, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 280, 1765, (2013); Buffoni, Giuseppe, Individual-based models for stage structured populations: Formulation of ""no regression"" development equations, Journal of Mathematical Biology, 60, 6, pp. 831-848, (2010); Temperature Biology of Animals, (1987); Crespo-Pérez, Verónica, Modeling temperature-dependent survival with small datasets: Insights from tropical mountain agricultural pests, Bulletin of Entomological Research, 103, 3, pp. 336-343, (2013); Crespo-Pérez, Verónica, Modeling invasive species spread in complex landscapes: The case of potato moth in Ecuador, Landscape Ecology, 26, 10, pp. 1447-1461, (2011)","","Frontiers Media S.A. info@frontiersin.org","","","","","","1664042X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971237933"

Multi-decadal Earth and planetary remote sensing global datasets at the petabyte (8×1015 bits) scale are now available in commercial clouds (e.g., Google Earth Engine and Amazon NASA NEX), and new commercial satellite constellations are planning to generate petabytes of images per year, providing daily global coverage at a few meters per pixel. Cloud storage with adjacent high-bandwidth compute, combined with recent advances in machine learning for computer vision, is enabling understanding of the world at a scale and at a level of granularity never before feasible. We report here on a computation processing over a petabyte of compressed raw data from 2.8 quadrillion pixels (2.8 petapixels) acquired by the US Landsat and MODIS programs over the past 40 years. Using commodity cloud computing resources, we convert the imagery to a calibrated, georeferenced, multiresolution tiled format suited for machine-learning analysis. We believe ours is the first application to process, in less than a day, on generally available resources, over a petabyte of scientific image data. We report on work using this reprocessed dataset for experiments demonstrating country-scale food production monitoring, an indicator for famine early warning. We apply remote sensing science and machine learning algorithms to detect and classify agricultural crops and then estimate crop yields. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Machinery; Agriculture; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Vision; Crops; Digital Storage; Food Supply; Image Processing; Internet; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Nasa; Pattern Recognition; Pixels; Remote Sensing; Agricultural Crops; Commercial Satellites; Commodity Clouds; Computing System; Earth And Planetary Remote Sensing; Food Production; Scientific Images; Storage Technology; Satellite Imagery","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Crops; Digital storage; Food supply; Image processing; Internet; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; NASA; Pattern recognition; Pixels; Remote sensing; Agricultural crops; Commercial satellites; Commodity clouds; Computing system; Earth and planetary remote sensing; Food production; Scientific images; Storage technology; Satellite imagery","","","","undefined, (2015); undefined, (2015); Bailey, David H., The nas parallel benchmarks, International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, 5, 3, pp. 63-73, (1991); Proceedings International Conference on Parallel Processing, (1995); Behnel, Stefan, Cython: The best of both worlds, Computing in Science and Engineering, 13, 2, pp. 31-39, (2011); Bell, Gordon C., What's next in high-performance computing?, Communications of the ACM, 45, 2, pp. 91-95, (2002); Bell, Gordon C., Computer science: Beyond the data deluge, Science, 323, 5919, pp. 1297-1298, (2009); 28th Annual AIAA Usu Conference on Small Satellites, (2014); Using Lossy Jpeg 2000 Compression for Archival Master Files, (2013); Celery Distributed Task Queue","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop, AIPR 2015","","Washington; DC","121081","","9781467395588","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84966473926"

This has been the major motivation behind the development of the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, which has been extensively used since its first publication in 2007. The database relies on a downscaling methodology whereby census counts of animals in sub-national administrative units are redistributed at the level of grid cells as a function of a series of spatial covariates. The recent upgrade of GLW1 to GLW2 involved automating the processing, improvement of input data, and down-scaling at a spatial resolution of 1 km per cell (5 km per cell in the earlier version). The underlying statistical methodology, however, remained unchanged. In this paper, we evaluate new methods to downscale census data with a higher accuracy and increased processing efficiency. Two main factors were evaluated, based on sample census datasets of cattle in Africa and chickens in Asia. First, we implemented and evaluated Random Forest models (RF) instead of stratified regressions. Second, we investigated whether models that predicted the number of animals per rural person (per capita) could provide better downscaled estimates than the previous approach that predicted absolute densities (animals per km2). RF models consistently provided better predictions than the stratified regressions for both continents and species. The benefit of per capita over absolute density models varied according to the species and continent. In addition, different technical options were evaluated to reduce the processing time while maintaining their predictive power. Future GLW runs (GLW 3.0) will apply the new RF methodology with optimized modelling options. The potential benefit of per capita models will need to be further investigated with a better distinction between rural and agricultural populations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Africa; Asia; Chicken; Disease Model; Human; Human Tissue; Human Versus Animal Comparison; Livestock; Model; Population Model; Prediction; Random Forest; Species; Animal; Factual Database; Theoretical Model; Animals; Databases, Factual; Livestock; Models, Theoretical","Africa; Asia; chicken; disease model; human; human tissue; human versus animal comparison; livestock; model; population model; prediction; random forest; species; animal; factual database; theoretical model; Animals; Databases, Factual; Livestock; Models, Theoretical","","","","Gridded Livestock of the World 2007 Internet Rome Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, (2007); van Boeckel, Thomas P., Global trends in antimicrobial use in food animals, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 112, 18, pp. 5649-5654, (2015); Gilbert, Marius, Predicting the risk of avian influenza A H7N9 infection in live-poultry markets across Asia, Nature Communications, 5, (2014); Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock A Global Assessment of Emissions and Mitigation Opportunities, (2013); Herrero, Mario, Biomass use, production, feed efficiencies, and greenhouse gas emissions from global livestock systems, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110, 52, pp. 20888-20893, (2013); Mapping of Poverty and Likely Zoonoses Hotspots, (2012); Gilbert, Marius, Income disparities and the global distribution of intensively farmed chicken and pigs, PLOS ONE, 10, 7, (2015); Jones, Bryony Anne, Zoonosis emergence linked to agricultural intensification and environmental change, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110, 21, pp. 8399-8404, (2013); Havlik, Petr, Climate change mitigation through livestock system transitions, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111, 10, pp. 3709-3714, (2014); Gridded Livestock of the World 2007, (2007)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","26977807","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961613483"

Gabon has recently launched a National Climate Action Plan with the intent of establishing a National Forest Monitoring System that meets the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 guidelines for the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. The assessment of areas of forest cover and forest cover change is essential to estimate activity data, defined as areas of various categories of land use change by the IPCC guidelines.An appropriately designed probability sample can be used to estimate forest cover and net change and their associated uncertainties and express them in the form of confidence intervals at selected probability thresholds as required in the IPCC 2006 guidelines and for reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, wall-to-wall mapping is often required to provide a comprehensive assessment of forest resources and as input to land use plans for management purposes, but wall-to-wall approaches are more expensive than a sample based approach based on visual interpretation and require specialized equipment and staff. The recent release of the University of Maryland (UMD) Global Forest Change (GFC) map products could be an alternative for tropical countries wishing to develop their own wall-to-wall forest map products but without the resources to do so. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of replacing national wall-to-wall forest maps with forest maps obtained from the UMD GFC initiative.A model assisted regression (MAR) estimator was applied using the combination of reference data obtained from a probability sample and forest cover and forest cover change maps either (i) produced nationally or (ii) obtained from the UMD GFC data. The resulting activity data are potentially more accurate than the SRS estimate and provide an assessment of the precision of the estimate which is not available from map accuracy indices alone. Results obtained for 2000 and 2010 for both the national and UMD GFC datasets confirm the high level of forest cover in Gabon, more than 23.5 million ha representing approximately 88.5% of the country.Although the UMD GFC dataset provides a reliable means of producing area statistics at national level combined with appropriate sample reference data, thus offering an alternative to nationally produced datasets (i) the classification errors associated with the Global dataset have non-negligible effects on both the estimate and the precision which supports the more general statement that map data should not be used alone to produce area estimates, and (ii) the maps obtained from the UMD GFC dataset require specific calibration of the tree cover percentage representing a non-negligible effort requiring specialized staff and equipment. Guidelines on how to use and further improve UMD GFC maps for national reporting are suggested. However, this additional effort would still most likely be less than the production of national based maps. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification (of Information); Climate Change; Deforestation; Environmental Regulations; Gas Emissions; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gases; Human Resource Management; Land Use; Probability; Remote Sensing; Uncertainty Analysis; Comprehensive Assessment; Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Changes; National Forest Inventories; Probability Threshold; Satellite Remote Sensing; Specialized Equipment; United Nations Framework Convention On Climate Changes; University Of Maryland; Forestry; Accuracy Assessment; Data Set; Forest Cover; Global Perspective; International Organization; Land Use Change; Mapping Method; National Planning; Remote Sensing; Resource Assessment; Gabon; Maryland; United States","Classification (of information); Climate change; Deforestation; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Human resource management; Land use; Probability; Remote sensing; Uncertainty analysis; Comprehensive assessment; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; National forest inventories; Probability threshold; Satellite remote sensing; Specialized equipment; United nations framework convention on climate changes; University of Maryland; Forestry; accuracy assessment; data set; forest cover; global perspective; international organization; land use change; mapping method; national planning; remote sensing; resource assessment; Gabon; Maryland; United States","","","The production of forest cover and forest cover change maps was funded under the European Space Agency (ESA) Global Monitoring for the Environment and Security Service Element on Forest Monitoring REDD extension project (GSE FM REDD) coordinated by GAF AG and The GEOFORAFRI project funded by the Fond Français pour l'Environnement Mondial (FFEM).","Achard, Frédéric, Pan-tropical monitoring of deforestation, Environmental Research Letters, 2, 4, (2007); undefined, (2012); Remote Sensing of Forest Environments Concepts and Case Studies, (2003); undefined, (2014); L Alliance Delicate De La Gestion Forestiere Et De La Biodiversite Dans Les Forets Du Centre Du Gabon, (2003); Ernst, Celine, National forest cover change in Congo Basin: Deforestation, reforestation, degradation and regeneration for the years 1990, 2000 and 2005, Global Change Biology, 19, 4, pp. 1173-1187, (2013); Fichet, Louis Vincent, Assessing the accuracy of forest cover map for 1990, 2000 and 2010 at national scale in gabon, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 7, 4, pp. 1346-1356, (2014); Fichet, Louis Vincent, Mapping dry forest in Central African Republic using optical and radar data, International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), pp. 2336-2339, (2014); Integrating Remote Sensing and Ground Based Observations for Estimation of Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases in Forests Methods and Guidance from the Global Forest Observations Initiative, (2013); A Sourcebook of Methods and Procedures for Monitoring and Reporting Anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals Caused by Deforestation Gains and Losses of Carbon Stocks in Forests Remaining Forests and Forestation, (2014)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","00344257","","RSEEA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951773420"

While a wealth of data exists from high latitude regions, little is known on the amount and composition of nutrient fluxes from densely populated tropical catchments. The South Indian Pamba River is a prime example in this respect because of its manifold human interventions such as the Sabarimala pilgrimage, the largest pilgrim centre in the world and agricultural practices. In order (i) to identify direct cause-effect relationships, (ii) to quantify land use specific nutrient inputs and (iii) to assess the respective impacts water was sampled along the river course during the pre monsoon, south west monsoon and north east monsoon periods in 2010 to 2012. Sampling segments were chosen according to prevailing land use. A socioeconomic survey on agricultural practices was conducted to collect information on the type, time and quantity of fertilizer application. Our results indicate (i) little human activities in the forest segment resulted in a low nutrient yield; (ii) pilgrim activities led to high ammonium and phosphate yields in the temple segment; (iii) specific fertilizer management resulted in moderate and maximum nitrate yields in the respective agriculture segments. Annual NPK fertilizer inputs to the catchment were 95 kg ha− 1 yr− 1.The average yield for the Pamba River catchment amounted to 3.5 kg ha− 1 yr− 1 of DIN and 0.2 kg ha− 1 yr− 1 of phosphate-P. As opposing predictions for densely-populated regions the N and P yields of the Pamba River are moderate to low on a global scale. It highlights the need for land use specific quantitative estimates from tropical regions in order to improve the global database and local water quality management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Environmental Change; Land Use; Nutrient Biogeochemistry; Pilgrims; River Catchment; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Fertilizers; Nitrogen Compounds; Phosphorus; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Atmospheric Thermodynamics; Biogeochemistry; Catchments; Economics; Fertilizers; Forestry; Land Use; Quality Management; Rivers; Runoff; Water Conservation; Water Management; Water Quality; Agricultural Practices; Anthropogenic Inputs; Coastal Area; Environmental Change; High-latitude Regions; Human Intervention; Nutrient Biogeochemistry; Nutrient Fluxes; Pilgrim; River Catchment; Nutrients; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Fertilizer; Nitrogen Derivative; Water Pollutant; Anthropogenic Effect; Anthropogenic Source; Biogeochemistry; Catchment; Environmental Change; Fertilizer Application; Nutrient Cycling; River Water; Sampling; Water Quality; Agricultural Procedures; Article; Chemical Composition; Concentration (parameters); Economic Aspect; Environmental Impact Assessment; Environmental Management; Environmental Monitoring; Geographic Distribution; Human; Human Activities; India; Land Use; Population Density; Priority Journal; Religion; River; Seashore; Seasonal Variation; Water Analysis; Water Sampling; Watershed; Agriculture; Analysis; Environmental Protection; Procedures; Statistics And Numerical Data; Kerala; Pamba River; Agriculture; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen Compounds; Phosphorus; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Biogeochemistry; Catchments; Economics; Fertilizers; Forestry; Land use; Quality management; Rivers; Runoff; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Agricultural practices; Anthropogenic inputs; Coastal area; Environmental change; High-latitude regions; Human intervention; Nutrient biogeochemistry; Nutrient fluxes; Pilgrim; River catchment; Nutrients; nitrogen; phosphorus; fertilizer; nitrogen derivative; water pollutant; anthropogenic effect; anthropogenic source; biogeochemistry; catchment; environmental change; fertilizer application; nutrient cycling; river water; sampling; water quality; agricultural procedures; Article; chemical composition; concentration (parameters); economic aspect; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental monitoring; geographic distribution; human; human activities; India; land use; population density; priority journal; religion; river; seashore; seasonal variation; water analysis; water sampling; watershed; agriculture; analysis; environmental protection; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Kerala; Pamba River; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen Compounds; Phosphorus; Water Pollutants, Chemical","","nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Fertilizers; Nitrogen Compounds; Phosphorus; Water Pollutants, Chemical","We thank Aneesh R., Arun R., and Vandana M., of the National Centre for Earth Science Studies, Kerala, India, and Tz-ChingYeh for the help during field work.

Consequently, such in vivo analysis is enhanced using computational approaches, such as phylodynamic modeling and simulation. Phylodynamics aims to simultaneously model, simulate, and analyze the interrelated phenotypic, genotypic, and epidemiological processes that occur in nature. This paper presents our extended approach for phylodynamic modeling and simulation of AIV Specifically, we focus on modeling and simulation of multiple species of high risk waterfowl and environmental factors. In addition, we present results from case studies using real world data sets from 3 high risk countries, namely: Turkey, Nigeria, and Vietnam. The paper also discusses results from generalized sensitivity analyses conducted to identify influential ecological and epidemiological parameters.

Improved management of agricultural water is important because agriculture is the dominant user of fresh water. Estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) using satellite imagery is regarded as an effective tool for improving agricultural water management. This paper presents the progress made in the development of a global Evapotranspiration-Index (ET<inf>index</inf>) estimation algorithm that is applicable to Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) satellite observation. The algorithm computes an ET-related indicator that is termed the ET<inf>index</inf>. The primary input data are thermal observation data from the satellite and near-surface wind speed data from a global climate model. The ET<inf>index</inf> is equivalent to the crop coefficient, which has been applied widely for agricultural and irrigation water management around the globe. As a result, the ET<inf>index</inf> maps have congruency with traditional agricultural water management methodologies, although the application targets of the ET<inf>index</inf> are not limited to irrigation or agriculture. The algorithm estimates the ET<inf>index</inf> by analyzing the relative position of actual surface temperature between two extreme surface conditions (wet and dry conditions). Estimation of the wet and dry surface temperatures is a key component of the algorithm. The developed model represents the wet and dry surface temperatures with less than 1℃ bias and less than 6℃ random error in Shenmu, China. The simple structure of the algorithm is designed to process global data with limited computational load. The final product is a 16-day, cloud-free global ET<inf>index</inf> map having spatial resolution equal to that of GCOM-C thermal observation. Daily actual ET is estimated from the global ET<inf>index</inf> map using local or global weather datasets that include cloudy and rainy days. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crop Coefficient; Evapotranspiration; Gcom-c; Surface Temperature; Water Management","","","","Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).","Crop Evapotranspiration Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements, (1998); Allen, Richard Glen, Satellite-based energy balance for mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration (METRIC) - Applications, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering - ASCE, 133, 4, pp. 395-406, (2007); Allen, Richard Glen, Satellite-based energy balance for mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration (METRIC) - Model, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering - ASCE, 133, 4, pp. 380-394, (2007); Anderson, Martha C., Effects of vegetation clumping on two-source model estimates of surface energy fluxes from an agricultural landscape during SMACEX, Journal of Hydrometeorology, 6, 6, pp. 892-909, (2005); Bastiaanssen, Wim G.M., A remote sensing surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL): 1.

In forensic science the stable isotope ratios of human remains such as hair and nail are used for geographical allocation. Thus, knowledge of the global spatial distribution of human δ13C and δ15N values is an essential component in the interpretation of stable isotope analytical results. Methods No substantial global datasets of human stable isotope ratios are currently available, although the amount of available (published) data has increased within recent years. We have herein summarised the published data on human global δ13C andδ15N values (around 3600 samples) and added experimental values of more than 400 additional worldwide human hair and nail samples. In order to summarise isotope ratios for hair and nail samples correction factors were determined. Results The current available dataset of human stable isotope ratios is biased towards Europe and North America with only limited data for countries in Africa, Central and South America and Southeast Asia. The global spatial distribution of carbon isotopes is related to latitude and supports the fact that human δ13C values are dominated by the amount of C<inf>4</inf> plants in the diet, either due to direct ingestion as plant food, or by its use as animal feed. In contrast, the global spatial distribution of human δ15N values is apparently not exclusively related to the amount of fish or meat ingested, but also to environmental factors that influence agricultural production. Conclusions There are still a large proportion of countries, especially in Africa, where there are no available data for human carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. Although the interpretation of modern human carbon isotope ratios at the global scale is quite possible, and correlates with the latitude, the potential influences of extrinsic and/or intrinsic factors on human nitrogen isotope ratios have to be taken into consideration. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon; Nitrogen; Carbon Isotopes; Nitrogen Isotopes; Agriculture; Carbon; Isotopes; Nitrogen; Carbon Isotope Ratio; Carbon Stable Isotopes; Environmental Factors; Human Hair; N Value; Nail Samples; Nitrogen Isotope Ratio; Nitrogen Stable Isotope; Stable Carbon; Stable Isotope Ratios; Spatial Distribution; Carbon; Nitrogen; Animal; Chemistry; Factual Database; Hair; Health; Horse; Human; Mass Spectrometry; Nail; Spatial Analysis; Animals; Carbon Isotopes; Databases, Factual; Global Health; Hair; Horses; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Nails; Nitrogen Isotopes; Spatial Analysis","Agriculture; Carbon; Isotopes; Nitrogen; Carbon isotope ratio; Carbon stable isotopes; Environmental factors; Human hair; N value; Nail samples; Nitrogen isotope ratio; Nitrogen stable isotope; Stable carbon; Stable isotope ratios; Spatial distribution; carbon; nitrogen; animal; chemistry; factual database; hair; health; horse; human; mass spectrometry; nail; spatial analysis; Animals; Carbon Isotopes; Databases, Factual; Global Health; Hair; Horses; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Nails; Nitrogen Isotopes; Spatial Analysis","","carbon, 7440-44-0; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Carbon Isotopes; Nitrogen Isotopes","","Meier-Augenstein, Wolfram, Forensic isotope analysis leads to identification of a mutilated murder victim, Science and Justice, 48, 3, pp. 153-159, (2008); Rauch, Elisabeth, Origin assignment of unidentified corpses by use of stable isotope ratios of light (bio-) and heavy (geo-) elements-A case report, Forensic Science International, 168, 2-3, pp. 215-218, (2007); Mützel, Elisabeth, Assignment of unknown persons to their geographical origin by determination of stable isotopes in hair samples, International Journal of Legal Medicine, 123, 1, pp. 35-40, (2009); Lehn, Christine, Provenancing of unidentified corpses by stable isotope techniques - presentation of case studies, Science and Justice, 55, 1, pp. 72-88, (2015); Schoeller, Dale A., Isotope fractionation: Why aren't we what we eat?, Journal of Archaeological Science, 26, 6, pp. 667-673, (1999); Huelsemann, Frank, Effect of a controlled dietary change on carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of human hair, Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, 23, 16, pp. 2448-2454, (2009); Nakamura, K., Geographical variations in the carbon isotope composition of the diet and hair in contemporary man, Biomedical Mass Spectrometry, 9, 9, pp. 390-394, (1982); Schoeller, Dale A., Stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen in the contemporary north american human food web, Ecology of Food and Nutrition, 18, 3, pp. 159-170, (1986); Bol, Roland A., Multiple stable isotope (18O, 13C, 15N and 34S) analysis of human hair to identify the recent migrants in a rural community in SW England, Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, 21, 18, pp. 2951-2954, (2007); MacKo, Stephen A., The Ice Man's diet as reflected by the stable nitrogen and carbon isotopic composition of his hair, FASEB Journal, 13, 3, pp. 559-562, (1999)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","10970231; 09514198","","RCMSE","26467223","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944249793"

A crop calendar (CC), which defines the date or month when farmers sow and harvest crops, is an essential input for the numerical estimations. This study aims to present a new global data set, the SAtellite-derived CRop calendar for Agricultural simulations (SACRA), and to discuss advantages and disadvantages compared to existing census-based and model-derived products. We estimate global CC at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin using satellite-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, which corresponds to vegetation vitality and senescence on the land surface. Using the time series of the NDVI averaged from three consecutive years (2004-2006), sowing/harvesting dates are estimated for six crops (temperate-wheat, snow-wheat, maize, rice, soybean and cotton). We assume time series of the NDVI represent the phenology of one dominant crop and estimate CCs of the dominant crop in each grid. The dominant crops are determined using harvested areas based on census-based data. The cultivation period of SACRA is identified from the time series of the NDVI; therefore, SACRA considers current effects of human decisions and natural disasters. The difference between the estimated sowing dates and other existing products is less than 2 months (< 62 days) in most of the areas. A major disadvantage of our method is that the mixture of several crops in a grid is not considered in SACRA. The assumption of one dominant crop in each grid is a major source of discrepancy in crop calendars between SACRA and other products. The disadvantages of our approach may be reduced with future improvements based on finer satellite sensors and crop-type classification studies to consider several dominant crops in each grid. The comparison of the CC also demonstrates that identification of wheat type (sowing in spring or fall) is a major source of error in global CC estimations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Cultivation; Disasters; Forestry; Satellites; Surveys; Time Series; Vegetation; Biomass Productions; Crop Type Classification; Cultivation Periods; Future Improvements; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Datum; Numerical Estimation; Spatial Resolution; Supply-demand Relationships; Crops; Biomass Allocation; Cotton; Data Set; Future Prospect; Harvesting; Irrigation System; Maize; Ndvi; Rice; Satellite Data; Sensor; Sowing Date; Spatial Resolution; Water Use; Wheat; Glycine Max; Gossypium Hirsutum; Triticum Aestivum; Zea Mays","Agriculture; Cultivation; Disasters; Forestry; Satellites; Surveys; Time series; Vegetation; Biomass productions; Crop type classification; Cultivation periods; Future improvements; Normalized difference vegetation index datum; Numerical estimation; Spatial resolution; Supply-demand relationships; Crops; biomass allocation; cotton; data set; future prospect; harvesting; irrigation system; maize; NDVI; rice; satellite data; sensor; sowing date; spatial resolution; water use; wheat; Glycine max; Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays","","","","Döll, Petra, Global modeling of irrigation water requirements, Water Resources Research, 38, 4, pp. 8-8-10, (2002); Drusch, Matthias, Sentinel-2: ESA's Optical High-Resolution Mission for GMES Operational Services, Remote Sensing of Environment, 120, pp. 25-36, (2012); Dye, Dennis G., Seasonality and trends of snow-cover, vegetation index, and temperature in northern Eurasia, Geophysical Research Letters, 30, 7, pp. 1-58, (2003); Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, (2006); Geosci Model Dev, (2013); Global Agro Ecological Zones, (2000); Hall, Dorothy K., MODIS snow-cover products, Remote Sensing of Environment, 83, 1-2, pp. 181-194, (2002); Hanasaki, Naota, An integrated model for the assessment of global water resources - Part 2: Applications and assessments, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 12, 4, pp. 1027-1037, (2008); Hanjra, Munir A., Global water crisis and future food security in an era of climate change, Food Policy, 35, 5, pp. 365-377, (2010); Herold, M., Some challenges in global land cover mapping: An assessment of agreement and accuracy in existing 1 km datasets, Remote Sensing of Environment, 112, 5, pp. 2538-2556, (2008)","","Copernicus GmbH info@copernicus.org","","","","","","10275606; 16077938","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946601418"

The results provide evidence that the presence of SEM in certain dairy ingredients (whey, milk protein concentrates) is a by-product of chemical reactions taking place during the manufacturing process. Of the dairy ingredients tested (c. 2000 samples), 5.3% showed traces of SEM > 0.5 µg/kg. The highest incidence of SEM-positive samples in the dairy category were whey (powders, liquid) and milk protein concentrates (35% positive), with up to 13 µg/kg measured in a whey powder. Sweet buttermilk powder and caseinate followed, with 27% and 9.3% positives, respectively. SEM was not detected in raw milk, or in yoghurt or cheese. Of the crustacean products (shrimp and prawn powders) tested, 44% were positive for SEM, the highest value measured at 284 µg/kg. Fish powders revealed an unexpectedly high incidence of positive samples (25%); in this case, fraudulent addition of shellfish shells or carry-over during processing cannot be excluded. Overall, the data provide new insights into the occurrence of SEM (for dairy products and fish powders), substantially strengthening the arguments that SEM in certain food categories is not a conclusive marker of the use of the illegal antibiotic nitrofurazone. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Azodicarbonamide; Dairy; Food Ingredients; Gaskets; Hydrazine; Hypochlorite; Meat; Milk; Nitrofurazone; Seafood; Semicarbazide; Survey; Urea; Nitrofural; Semicarbazide; Biomarkers; Carbamylhydrazine; Nitrofurazone; Semicarbazides; Animals; Dairies; Dairy Products; Fish; Fish Products; Food Additives; Gaskets; Hydrazine; Powders; Proteins; Shellfish; Surveying; Urea; Azodicarbonamide; Food Ingredients; Hypochlorite; Milk; Nitrofurazone; Seafood; Semicarbazide; Meats; Milk Protein; Nitrofural; Semicarbazide; Yoghurt; Biological Marker; Carbamylhydrazine; Semicarbazide Derivative; Article; Butter; Cheese; Dairy Product; Drug Use; Farm Animal; Food Analysis; Food Control; Food Storage; Meat; Nonhuman; Priority Journal; Raw Food; Sea Food; Shrimp; Whey; Analysis; Animal; Bovine; Chicken; Domestic Animal; Food Contamination; Honey; Animals, Domestic; Biomarkers; Cattle; Chickens; Food Contamination; Honey; Meat; Semicarbazides","Animals; Dairies; Dairy products; Fish; Fish products; Food additives; Gaskets; Hydrazine; Powders; Proteins; Shellfish; Surveying; Urea; Azodicarbonamide; Food ingredients; hypochlorite; milk; Nitrofurazone; seafood; Semicarbazide; Meats; milk protein; nitrofural; semicarbazide; yoghurt; biological marker; carbamylhydrazine; semicarbazide derivative; Article; butter; cheese; dairy product; drug use; farm animal; food analysis; food control; food storage; meat; nonhuman; priority journal; raw food; sea food; shrimp; whey; analysis; animal; bovine; chicken; domestic animal; food contamination; honey; Animals, Domestic; Biomarkers; Cattle; Chickens; Food Contamination; Honey; Meat; Semicarbazides","","nitrofural, 59-87-0; semicarbazide, 57-56-7; Biomarkers; carbamylhydrazine; Nitrofurazone; Semicarbazides","","Abernethy, Grant A., Lactose semicarbazone as a marker for semicarbazide adulteration in milk, Journal of Chromatography A, 1295, pp. 152-155, (2013); Abernethy, Grant A., Generation of semicarbazide from natural azine development in foods, followed by reaction with urea compounds, Food Additives and Contaminants - Part A, 32, 9, pp. 1416-1430, (2015); Becalski, Adam, Semicarbazide in Canadian bakery products, Food Additives and Contaminants, 23, 2, pp. 107-109, (2006); Becalski, Adam, Semicarbazide formation in azodicarbonamide-treated flour: A model study, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 52, 18, pp. 5730-5734, (2004); Bendall, Justin G., Semicarbazide is non-specific as a marker metabolite to reveal nitrofurazone abuse as it can form under Hofmann conditions, Food Additives and Contaminants - Part A, 26, 1, pp. 47-56, (2009); Oj L, (1995); Official Journal of the European Communities, (2002); Oj L, (2005); Cooper, Kevin M., Kinetics of semicarbazide and nitrofurazone in chicken eggs and egg powders, Food Additives and Contaminants - Part A, 25, 6, pp. 684-692, (2008); Report for the Food Standards Agency in Scotland Project Code Fs241065, (2012)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","19440057; 19440049","","","26359628","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945461610"

However, no-till (NT), a fundamental component of CA, has been shown to reduce yields in many cases. In order to maintain yields following adoption of CA, it has been recently suggested that fertilizer application should be an integral component of CA. To determine the contribution of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in minimizing yield declines following NT implementation, we assessed 2759 paired comparisons of NT and conventional tillage (CT) systems from 325 studies reported in the peer-reviewed literature between 1980 and 2013. Overall, we found that NT yields decreased -10.7% (-14.8% to -6.5%) and -3.7% (-5.3% to -2.2%) relative to CT in tropical/subtropical and temperate regions, respectively. Among management and environmental variables that included: the rate of N fertilization; the duration of the NT/CT comparison; residue, rotation, and irrigation practices; the crop type; and the site aridity, N rate was the most important explanatory variable for NT yield declines in tropical/subtropical regions. In temperate regions, N fertilization rates were relatively less important. NT yield declines were most consistently observed at low rates of N fertilization during the first 2 years of NT adoption in tropical/subtropical regions. Applications of N fertilizer at rates of up to 85±12kgNha-1yr-1 significantly reduced NT yield declines in these scenarios. While this result should not be viewed as a rate recommendation, it does suggest that farmers applying rates of N fertilizer that are low for their specific system will, on average, see higher NT yields if they increase application rates. In addition, when crop rotation was not practiced or residues were removed from the field, NT yield declines were magnified by low rates of N fertilization in tropical/subtropical regions. These results, based on a global data set and across a broad range of crops, highlight the importance of N fertilization in counteracting yield declines in NT systems, particularly in tropical/subtropical regions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Meta-analysis; Nitrogen Fertilizer; No-till Duration; Residue; Rotation; Temperate; Tillage; Tropical/subtropical; Agricultural Intensification; Agricultural Management; Aridity; Climate Change; Climatic Region; Crop Residue; Crop Rotation; Fertilizer Application; Irrigation; Meta-analysis; Nitrogen; Temperate Environment; Yield Response; Zero Tillage","agricultural intensification; agricultural management; aridity; climate change; climatic region; crop residue; crop rotation; fertilizer application; irrigation; meta-analysis; nitrogen; temperate environment; yield response; zero tillage","","","We are grateful to the National Key Science and Technology Project of China for supporting X.Q.L. with grant No. 2014ZX07101-012 .

The study was conducted in a single plot over four different years and crop types (rapeseed, wheat, peas, and rye) included in a rotation scheme governed by rapeseed. Calculations were made separately for a global dataset covering the whole four year/crop period and for each individual dataset belonging to each year/crop. The analysis was also carried out for the crop growing season (hereafter referred to as the maximum interest period-MIP). An imbalance of 14% was found when using the global dataset. A similar value of 13% was also obtained when the study period was limited to the MIP. A marked improvement was found in the energy balance closure when soil heat flux, G<inf>P</inf>, was corrected for soil energy storage. With this correction, a 92% and 93% closure emerged when the global dataset and MIP were studied, respectively. In addition, the energy partitioning in the various processes evidenced different results depending on the selected study period. When the global dataset was considered, sensible heat, H, usually played the main role in the energy partitioning. However, if only the MIP was selected, latent heat, LE, became the main driver dissipating energy while the crop reached full development for this period. The highest LE contributions to the energy balance were found for rapeseed and rye. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Eddy Covariance; Energy Balance; Energy Balance Closure; Energy Partitioning; Rapeseed; Crops; Cultivation; Digital Storage; Heat Flux; Oilseeds; Quality Control; Eddy Covariance; Eddy Covariance Data; Energy Partitioning; Growing Season; Rapeseed; Sensible Heat; Soil Energy Storage; Soil Heat Flux; Energy Balance; Agricultural Management; Canola; Cereal; Crop Improvement; Crop Rotation; Data Set; Eddy Covariance; Energy Balance; Energy Crop; Energy Efficiency; Growing Season; Latent Heat Flux; Partitioning; Sensible Heat Flux; Brassica Napus; Pisum Sativum; Secale Cereale; Triticum Aestivum","Crops; Cultivation; Digital storage; Heat flux; Oilseeds; Quality control; Eddy covariance; Eddy covariance data; Energy partitioning; Growing season; Rapeseed; Sensible heat; Soil energy storage; Soil heat flux; Energy balance; agricultural management; canola; cereal; crop improvement; crop rotation; data set; eddy covariance; energy balance; energy crop; energy efficiency; growing season; latent heat flux; partitioning; sensible heat flux; Brassica napus; Pisum sativum; Secale cereale; Triticum aestivum","","","This research has been supported jointly by MICINN (in the framework of project CGL2009-11979 and scholarship BES-2010-039319) and ERDF (the European Regional Development Fund) funds, to whom the authors express their gratitude.

Delivery of timely and accurate soil moisture data can play a vital role in monitoring the status of available water reserves for this sector. Passive microwave sensors, such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), are well suited for monitoring vast landscapes given their all-weather capabilities, large spatial footprint, frequent revisit, and the sensitivity of microwave emissions to the soil dielectric. This study examines the impact of exploiting Canadian soil and land cover datasets in the retrieval of soil moisture from SMOS over an agricultural area in the province of Manitoba (Canada). Results demonstrate that global datasets that are integrated within the current SMOS processor perform adequately when field measured soil moisture is compared to estimates of soil moisture by SMOS (R2 of 0.70 (p > .01) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 7.15% with a negative (dry) bias of ?0.05%). Overall, this study showed that ingesting high-quality national datasets into the SMOS soil moisture retrieval algorithm did not fully resolve the underestimation of soil moisture, suggesting that further investigation is required to understand this bias. Also, several approaches were evaluated to improve statistical field-derived soil moisture representation in the validation of SMOS soil moisture retrieval and it is clear that good representation of soil moisture as a function of soil textures is crucial to accurately validate SMOS soil moisture products. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Brightness Temperature; Land Surface; Monitoring; Passive Microwave Remote Sensing; Soil Moisture; Surface Texture; Agriculture; Mean Square Error; Microwave Sensors; Moisture; Soil Surveys; Soils; Agricultural Landscapes; Agricultural Sector; Microwave Emissions; Passive Microwave Sensors; Root Mean Square Errors; Soil Moisture And Ocean Salinity (smos); Soil Moisture Retrievals; Sustainable Agriculture; Soil Moisture; Agricultural Land; Brightness Temperature; Land Cover; Land Surface; Monitoring; Remote Sensing; Smos; Soil Moisture; Canada","Agriculture; Mean square error; Microwave sensors; Moisture; Soil surveys; Soils; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural sector; Microwave emissions; Passive microwave sensors; Root mean square errors; Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS); Soil moisture retrievals; Sustainable agriculture; Soil moisture; agricultural land; brightness temperature; land cover; land surface; monitoring; remote sensing; SMOS; soil moisture; Canada","","","","13th Int Conf on Interactive Information and Processing Systems for Meteorology Oceanography and Hydrology, (1997); Early Warning Systems for Drought Preparedness and Drought Management, (2000); Observing Our Planet for A Better Future Geneva Switzerland, (2008); Brown, Molly E., Assessment of soil moisture data requirements by the potential SMAP data user community: Review of SMAP mission user community, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 7, 1, pp. 277-283, (2014); Bolten, John Dennis, Evaluating the Utility of Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture Retrievals for Operational Agricultural Drought Monitoring, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 3, 1, pp. 57-66, (2010); Bircher, Simone, A soil moisture and temperature network for SMOS validation in Western Denmark, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 16, 5, pp. 1445-1463, (2012); Eagleman, Joe R., REMOTE SENSING OF SOIL MOISTURE BY A 21-cm PASSIVE RADIOMETER., Journal of Geophysical Research, 81, 21, pp. 3660-3666, (1976); Jackson, Thomas J., Soil moisture updating and microwave remote sensing for hydrological simulation, Hydrological Sciences Bulletin, 26, 3, pp. 305-319, (1981); Escorihuela, Maria José, Effective soil moisture sampling depth of L-band radiometry: A case study, Remote Sensing of Environment, 114, 5, pp. 995-1001, (2010); Mattia, Francesco, Soil moisture retrieval through a merging of multi-temporal L-band SAR data and hydrologic modelling, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 13, 3, pp. 343-356, (2009)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","","","","","21511535; 19391404","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930427623"

Currently, based on the view of combining the overall control of cropland area and 'top-down' decision-making behaviors, here are two global historical land-use datasets, generally referred as the Sustainability and the Global Environment datasets (SAGE datasets) and History Database of the Global Environment datasets (HYDE datasets). However, at the regional level, these global datasets have coarse resolutions and inevitable errors. Considering various factors that influenced cropland distribution, including cropland connectivity and the limitation of natural and human factors, this study developed a reconstruction model of historical cropland based on constrained Cellular Automaton (CA) of 'bottom-up'. Then, an available labor force index is used as a proxy for the amount of cropland to inspect and calibrate these spatial patterns. Applied the reconstruction model to Shandong Province, we reconstructed its spatial distribution of cropland during 8 periods. The reconstructed results show that: 1) it is properly suitable for constrained CA to simulate and reconstruct the spatial distribution of cropland in traditional cultivated region of China; 2) compared with 'SAGE datasets' and 'HYDE datasets', this study have formed higher-resolution Boolean spatial distribution datasets of historical cropland with a more definitive concept of spatial pattern in terms of fractional format. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Constrained Cellular Automaton (ca); Historical Cropland; Reconstruction; Shandong Province; Traditional Cultivated Region; Agricultural History; Agricultural Land; Cellular Automaton; Cultivar; Decision Making; Reconstruction; Spatial Distribution; China; Shandong","agricultural history; agricultural land; cellular automaton; cultivar; decision making; reconstruction; spatial distribution; China; Shandong","","","","Bai, Shuying, Digital rebuilding of LUCC spatial-temporal distribution of the last 100 years: Taking Dorbod Mongolian Autonomous County in Daqing City as an example, Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica, 62, 4, pp. 427-436, (2007); Cao, Xue, Research on cropland data recovery and reconstruction in the Qing Dynasty: Method and case study, Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica, 68, 2, pp. 245-256, (2013); History Teaching, (2010); Feddema, Johannes Jan, Atmospheric science: The importance of land-cover change in simulating future climates, Science, 310, 5754, pp. 1674-1678, (2005); Journal of Natural Resources, (2005); Foley, Jonathan A., Global consequences of land use, Science, 309, 5734, pp. 570-574, (2005); Progress in Natural Science, (2003); Klein Goldewijk, Kees, Estimating global land use change over the past 300 years: The HYDE database, Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 15, 2, pp. 417-433, (2001); Klein Goldewijk, Kees, Land cover change over the last three centuries due to human activities: The availability of new global data sets, GeoJournal, 61, 4, pp. 335-344, (2004); Klein Goldewijk, Kees, The HYDE 3.1 spatially explicit database of human-induced global land-use change over the past 12,000 years, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 20, 1, pp. 73-86, (2011)","","Science Press shengtaixuebao@mail.rcees.ac.cn","","","","","","10020063; 1993064X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939257676"

The harmonization and improvement of regional emission inventories is imperative to obtain consolidated estimates on the formation of global-scale air pollution. An emissions data set has been constructed using regional emission grid maps (annual and monthly) for SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, NH3, PM10, PM2.5, BC and OC for the years 2008 and 2010, with the purpose of providing consistent information to global and regional scale modelling efforts. This compilation of different regional gridded inventories-including that of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for USA, the EPA and Environment Canada (for Canada), the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) and Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) for Europe, and the Model Inter-comparison Study for Asia (MICS-Asia III) for China, India and other Asian countries-was gap-filled with the emission grid maps of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv4.3) for the rest of the world (mainly South America, Africa, Russia and Oceania). Emissions from seven main categories of human activities (power, industry, residential, agriculture, ground transport, aviation and shipping) were estimated and spatially distributed on a common grid of 0.1° × 0.1° longitude-latitude, to yield monthly, global, sector-specific grid maps for each substance and year. The HTAP-v2.2 air pollutant grid maps are considered to combine latest available regional information within a complete global data set. The disaggregation by sectors, high spatial and temporal resolution and detailed information on the data sources and references used will provide the user the required transparency. Because HTAP-v2.2 contains primarily official and/or widely used regional emission grid maps, it can be recommended as a global baseline emission inventory, which is regionally accepted as a reference and from which different scenarios assessing emission reduction policies at a global scale could start. An analysis of country-specific implied emission factors shows a large difference between industrialised countries and developing countries for acidifying gaseous air pollutant emissions (SO2 and NOx) from the energy and industry sectors. This is not observed for the particulate matter emissions (PM10, PM2.5), which show large differences between countries in the residential sector instead. The per capita emissions of all world countries, classified from low to high income, reveal an increase in level and in variation for gaseous acidifying pollutants, but not for aerosols. For aerosols, an opposite trend is apparent with higher per capita emissions of particulate matter for low income countries. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aerosol; Atmospheric Pollution; Emission Inventory; Long Range Transport; Northern Hemisphere; Particulate Matter; Pollutant Transport; Spatial Resolution; Africa; Canada; China; India; Netherlands; Russian Federation; South America; United States","aerosol; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; long range transport; Northern Hemisphere; particulate matter; pollutant transport; spatial resolution; Africa; Canada; China; India; Netherlands; Russian Federation; South America; United States","","","","Anderson, Soren T., Automobile fuel economy standards: Impacts, efficiency, and alternatives, Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, 5, 1, pp. 89-108, (2011); Andres, Robert J., A synthesis of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel combustion, Biogeosciences, 9, 5, pp. 1845-1871, (2012); Balsamà, Alessia Paola, Near-term projection of anthropogenic emission trends using neural networks, Atmospheric Environment, 89, pp. 581-592, (2014); Wiod Conference Paper, (2012); Carmichael, Gregory R., MICS-Asia II: The model intercomparison study for Asia Phase II methodology and overview of findings, Atmospheric Environment, 42, 15, pp. 3468-3490, (2008); Davis, Steven J., The supply chain of CO 2 emissions, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 108, 45, pp. 18554-18559, (2011); Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research Edgar, (2009); Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research Edgar Release Edgar Version 4 3, (2015); Task Force on Emission Inventories and Projections and the Secretariat, (2002); Emep Eea Air Pollutant Emission Inventory Guidebook 2013, (2013)","","Copernicus GmbH info@copernicus.org","","","","","","16807316; 16807324","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944676035"

Forest loss at a global scale has been unveiled with increasingly finer spatial resolution, but the forest extent and loss in protected areas (PAs) and in large intact forest landscapes (IFLs) have not so far been systematically assessed. Moreover, the impact of protection on preserving the IFLs is not well understood. In this study we conducted a consistent assessment of the global forest loss in PAs and IFLs over the period 2000-2012.We used recently published global remote sensing based spatial forest cover change data, being a uniform and consistent dataset over space and time, together with global datasets on PAs' and IFLs' locations. Our analyses revealed that on a global scale 3%of the protected forest, 2.5% of the intact forest, and 1.5%of the protected intact forest were lost during the study period. These forest loss rates are relatively high compared to global total forest loss of 5% for the same time period. The variation in forest losses and in protection effect was large among geographical regions and countries. In some regions the loss in protected forests exceeded 5% (e.g. in Australia and Oceania, and North America) and the relative forest loss was higher inside protected areas than outside those areas (e.g. inMongolia and parts of Africa, Central Asia, and Europe). At the same time, protection was found to prevent forest loss in several countries (e.g. in South America and Southeast Asia). Globally, high areaweighted forest loss rates of protected and intact forests were associated with high gross domestic product and in the case of protected forests also with high proportions of agricultural land. Our findings reinforce the need for improved understanding of the reasons for the high forest losses in PAs and IFLs and strategies to prevent further losses. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Africa; Agricultural Land; Australia; Europe; Forest; Gross National Product; Landscape; North America; Pacific Islands; Remote Sensing; South America; Southeast Asia; Agriculture; Asia; Environmental Protection; Forestry; Geographic Information System; Growth, Development And Aging; Human; Statistics And Numerical Data; Tree; Western Hemisphere; Agriculture; Americas; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Forestry; Forests; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Remote Sensing Technology; Trees","Africa; agricultural land; Australia; Europe; forest; gross national product; landscape; North America; Pacific islands; remote sensing; South America; Southeast Asia; agriculture; Asia; environmental protection; forestry; geographic information system; growth, development and aging; human; statistics and numerical data; tree; Western Hemisphere; Agriculture; Americas; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forestry; Forests; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Remote Sensing Technology; Trees","","","","Bonan, Gordon B., Forests and climate change: Forcings, feedbacks, and the climate benefits of forests, Science, 320, 5882, pp. 1444-1449, (2008); Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010, (2010); Gibson, Luke, Primary forests are irreplaceable for sustaining tropical biodiversity, Nature, 478, 7369, pp. 378-381, (2011); Pan, Yude, A large and persistent carbon sink in the world's forests, Science, 333, 6045, pp. 988-993, (2011); Hansen, Matthew C., High-resolution global maps of 21st-century forest cover change, Science, 342, 6160, pp. 850-853, (2013); Nepstad, Daniel Curtis, The end of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, Science, 326, 5958, pp. 1350-1351, (2009); Godar, Javier, Actor-specific contributions to the deforestation slowdown in the Brazilian Amazon, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111, 43, pp. 15591-15596, (2014); DeFries, Ruth S., Deforestation driven by urban population growth and agricultural trade in the twenty-first century, Nature Geoscience, 3, 3, pp. 178-181, (2010); What Drives Deforestation and What Stops It A Meta Analysis of Spatially Explicit Econometric Studies, (2014); Geist, Helmut J., Proximate causes and underlying driving forces of tropical deforestation, BioScience, 52, 2, pp. 143-150, (2002)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","26466348","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949024388"

Design A unique analysis using 'real-world' data was performed, in contrast to previous analyses which applied simulated data. Consumption data from the Adventist Health Study were used to identify two dietary patterns with a markedly different consumption of several plant and animal products. State agricultural data were collected and applied to commodity production statistics. Indices were created to allow a comparison of the resource requirements for each dietary pattern. Setting California, USA. Subjects None. Results The diet containing more animal products required an additional 10 252 litres of water, 9910 kJ of energy, 186 g of fertilizer and 6 g of pesticides per week in comparison to the diet containing less animal products. The greatest contribution to the difference came from the consumption of animal products, particularly beef. Conclusions Consuming a more plant-based diet could to an extent alleviate the negative environmental impacts related to food production.

Such areas have a “yield gap” between the crop yields they achieve and the crop yields that could be achieved under more intensive management. Crop yield gaps have received increased attention in recent years due to concerns over land scarcity, stagnating crop yield trends in some important agricultural areas, and large projected increases in food demand. Recent analyses of global data sets and results from ½eld trials have improved our understanding of where yield gaps exist and their potential contribution to increasing the food supply. Achieving yield gap closure is a complex task: while agronomic approaches to closing yield gaps are generally well-known, a variety of social, political, and economic factors allow them to persist. The degree to which closing yield gaps will lead to greater food security and environmental bene½ts remains unclear, and will be strongly influenced by the particular strategies adopted. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Foley, Jonathan A., Solutions for a cultivated planet, Nature, 478, 7369, pp. 337-342, (2011); Tilman, David G., Global food demand and the sustainable intensification of agriculture, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 108, 50, pp. 20260-20264, (2011); Global Food Demand and the Sustainable Intensi½cation of Agriculture; Lobell, David B., Climate adaptation as mitigation: The case of agricultural investments, Environmental Research Letters, 8, 1, (2013); Lobell, David B., Crop yield gaps: Their importance, magnitudes, and causes, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 34, pp. 179-204, (2009); Solutions for A Cultivated Planet; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, (2002); Dirzo, Rodolfo, Global state of biodiversity and loss, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 28, pp. 137-167, (2003); Ray, Deepak K., Recent patterns of crop yield growth and stagnation, Nature Communications, 3, (2012); Lin, Marena, Reckoning wheat yield trends, Environmental Research Letters, 7, 2, (2012)","","MIT Press Journals","","","","","","00115266; 15486192","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942903574"

A recent phenomenon in which climate change may play an important role is the acquisition of large tracts of land in the developing world by governments and corporations. In the target countries, where land is relatively inexpensive, the potential to increase crop yields is generally high and property rights are often poorly defined. By acquiring land, investors can realize large profits and countries can substantially alter the land and water resources under their control, thereby changing their outlook for meeting future demand. While the drivers, actors, and impacts involved with land deals have received substantial attention in the literature, we propose that climate change plays an important yet underappreciated role, both through its direct effects on agricultural production and through its influence on mitigative or adaptive policy decisions. Drawing from various literature sources as well as a new global database on reported land deals, we trace the evolution of the global land rush and highlight prominent examples in which the role of climate change is evident. We find that climate change - both historical and anticipated - interacts substantially with drivers of land acquisitions, having important implications for the resilience of communities in targeted areas. As a result of this synthesis, we ultimately contend that considerations of climate change should be integrated into future policy decisions relating to the large-scale land acquisitions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofuels; Carbon Credit; Climate Change; Climate Resilience; Global Land Rush; Land Acquisition","","","","","Adnan, Shapan, Land grabs and primitive accumulation in deltaic Bangladesh: Interactions between neoliberal globalization, state interventions, power relations and peasant resistance, Journal of Peasant Studies, 40, 1, pp. 87-128, (2013); Ainsworth, Elizabeth Anna, Direct Effects of Rising Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Ozone on Crop Yields, Advances in Global Change Research, 37, pp. 109-130, (2010); FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper, (1998); Moving Ahead with Redd Issues Options and Implications, (2008); Transnational Land Deals for Agriculture in the Global South Analytical Report Based on the Land Matrix Database, (2012); Anseeuw, Ward, Creating a public tool to assess and promote transparency in global land deals: The experience of the Land Matrix, Journal of Peasant Studies, 40, 3, pp. 521-530, (2013); Food Security and Sociopolitical Stability, (2013); Beddington, John R., Food security: Contributions from science to a new and greener revolution, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 365, 1537, pp. 61-71, (2010); Borras, Saturnino M., The politics of biofuels, land and agrarian change: Editors' introduction, Journal of Peasant Studies, 37, 4, pp. 575-592, (2010); Full Planet Empty Plates the New Geopolitics of Food Scarcity, (2012)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc http://www.wiley.com","","","","","","23284277","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015281684"

The pasture was intensively managed with addition of fertiliser and year-round rotational grazing by dairy cows. Climatic conditions and management practices had a large impact on CO<inf>2</inf> exchange, with a severe drought in one year and cultivation in another both causing large short-term (~3 months) net losses of CO<inf>2</inf>-C (100-200gCm-2). However, CO<inf>2</inf> was regained later in both of these years so that on annual timescales, the site was a CO<inf>2</inf> sink or CO<inf>2</inf> neutral. Management practices such as effluent application and harvesting silage also influenced non-CO<inf>2</inf>-C fluxes, and had a large impact on annual NECB. Despite these major environmental or management perturbations, both NEP and NECB were relatively constant on annual timescales. It is likely that this apparent resilience of the CO<inf>2</inf> and C balance to perturbations was at least partly attributable to the relatively warm temperatures, also in winter, providing good growing conditions year-round (in the absence of major perturbations such as moisture stress). In several instances, the farmer's decisions aimed at maintaining a constant milk yield between years also appeared to contribute to a relatively stable C balance. Averaged over the full four-year study period, the site was a net sink for both CO<inf>2</inf> (NEP=165±51gCm-2y-1), and total C (NECB=61±53gCm-2y-1) after non-CO<inf>2</inf>-C fluxes were accounted for. Annual NEP and NECB values were similar to results collated from other managed temperate grasslands on mineral soils globally, for which average NEP and NECB were 188±44gCm-2y-1 and 44±33gCm-2y-1, respectively. In the global dataset, we noted a general trend for increased C sequestration with increasing NEP, suggesting that it may be possible to meet the dual goal of increased pasture production (thus milk, meat and fiber production) and increasing soil C storage in managed temperate grasslands. Identification of management practices that increase C storage while maintaining or enhancing pasture production requires more standardised reporting between NECB studies, and experiments involving side-by-side comparison of treatment and control plots. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Balance; Carbon Dioxide; Cultivation; Eddy Covariance; Grassland; Grazed Agriculture; Net Ecosystem Exchange; Pasture; Carbon Balance; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Conditions; Cultivation; Dairy Farming; Decision Making; Eddy Covariance; Fertilizer Application; Grassland; Grazing; Management Practice; Net Ecosystem Exchange; Pasture","carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate conditions; cultivation; dairy farming; decision making; eddy covariance; fertilizer application; grassland; grazing; management practice; net ecosystem exchange; pasture","","","We would like to thank DairyNZ for providing access to the field site, and DairyNZ staff Errol Thom, John Siemelink, Chris Roach, Carol Leydon-Davis, Chris Glassey, Deanne Waugh, Cameron Clark, and Jim Lancaster for providing production data and information on farm management.

The most rapidly growing and contentious of these systems is organic agriculture. Whether organic agriculture can continue to expand will likely be determined by whether it is economically competitive with conventional agriculture. Here, we examined the financial performance of organic and conventional agriculture by conducting a meta-analysis of a global dataset spanning 55 crops grown on five continents. When organic premiums were not applied, benefit/cost ratios (-8 to -7%) and net present values (-27 to -23%) of organic agriculture were significantly lower than conventional agriculture. However, when actual premiums were applied, organic agriculture was significantly more profitable (22-35%) and had higher benefit/cost ratios (20-24%) than conventional agriculture. Although premiums were 29-32%, breakeven premiums necessary for organic profits to match conventional profits were only 5-7%, even with organic yields being 10-18% lower. Total costs were not significantly different, but labor costs were significantly higher (7-13%) with organic farming practices. Studies in our meta-analysis accounted for neither environmental costs (negative externalities) nor ecosystem services from good farming practices, which likely favor organic agriculture. With only 1% of the global agricultural land in organic production, our findings suggest that organic agriculture can continue to expand even if premiums decline. Furthermore, with their multiple sustainability benefits, organic farming systems can contribute a larger share in feeding the world. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic; Food Security; Meta-analysis; Organic Premiums; Sustainable Agriculture; Article; Cost Benefit Analysis; Crop Production; Ecosystem; Farming System; Financial Management; Food Security; Organic Farming; Priority Journal; Scale Up; Agriculture; Catering Service; Cost; Crop; Economics; Environmental Protection; Meta Analysis; Agriculture; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Cost-benefit Analysis; Costs And Cost Analysis; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Food Supply; Organic Agriculture","Article; cost benefit analysis; crop production; ecosystem; farming system; financial management; food security; organic farming; priority journal; scale up; agriculture; catering service; cost; crop; economics; environmental protection; meta analysis; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Costs and Cost Analysis; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Food Supply; Organic Agriculture","","","","Agriculture at A Crossroads, (2009); Rockström, Johan, A safe operating space for humanity, Nature, 461, 7263, pp. 472-475, (2009); Godfray, Charles H., Food security: The challenge of feeding 9 billion people, Science, 327, 5967, pp. 812-818, (2010); Report Submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, (2010); Toward Sustainable Agricultural Systems in the 21st Century, (2010); World of Organic Agriculture Statistics and Emerging Trends 2012, (2011); Halberg, Niels, The impact of organic farming on food security in a regional and global perspective, pp. 277-322, (2006); Reganold, John P., Transforming U.S. agriculture, Science, 332, 6030, pp. 670-671, (2011); Trewavas, Anthony J., Urban myths of organic farming, Nature, 410, 6827, pp. 409-410, (2001); Pickett, John Anthony, Food security: Intensification of agriculture is essential, for which current tools must be defended and new sustainable technologies invented, Food and Energy Security, 2, 3, pp. 167-173, (2013)","","National Academy of Sciences","","","","","","10916490; 00278424","","PNASA","26034271","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84935853135"

Some types of negative shocks, for example weather-related agricultural losses and vector-borne diseases, are expected to occur more frequently as a result of climate change. In this paper we measure the role of household- and location-specific characteristics in conditioning behavioural responses to a wide range of idiosyncratic and covariate shocks. We use data from 8,000 rural households in 25 developing countries, compiled in the global database of the Poverty Environment Network. We employ a hierarchical multinomial logit model to identify the importance of characteristics observed at different levels of aggregation on a set of strategies aimed at coping with economic shocks. Results indicate that in response to idiosyncratic shocks, households tend to deplete financial and durable assets, whereas covariate and thus often climate-related shocks predominantly result in reduced consumption. Households in sites characterised by high asset wealth tend to cope with shocks in a more proactive way than those in sites with average or below average asset wealth, but the role of asset types in conditioning shock responses varies across regions. Our findings have implications for rural development and climate change adaptation strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Coping; Economic Development; Forest Use; Poverty; Safety Nets; Vulnerability; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Coping Strategy; Developing World; Economic Development; Hierarchical System; Poverty; Rural Development; Rural Economy; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; coping strategy; developing world; economic development; hierarchical system; poverty; rural development; rural economy; vulnerability","","","","Alderman, Harold H., Poverty, household food security, and nutrition in rural Pakistan, 96, (1993); Ayers, Tim S., A Dispositional and Situational Assessment of Children's Coping: Testing Alternative Models of Coping, Journal of Personality, 64, 4, pp. 923-958, (1996); Beegle, Kathleen, Child labor and agricultural shocks, Journal of Development Economics, 81, 1, pp. 80-96, (2006); Burton, M.

No country is self-sufficient to address food security issues independently as almost all countries are inter-dependent for availability of plant genetic resources (PGR) in their national crop improvement programmes. Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research (CGIAR; in short CG) centres play an important role in conserving and distributing PGR through their genebanks. CG genebanks assembled the germplasm through collecting missions and acquisition the same from national genebanks of other countries. Using the Genesys Global Portal on Plant Genetic Resources, the World Information and Early Warning System (WIEWS) on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and other relevant databases, we analysed the conservation status of Indian-origin PGR accessions (both cultivated and wild forms possessed by India) in CG genebanks and other national genebanks, including the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) genebanks, which can be considered as an indicator of Indian contribution to the global germplasm collection. A total of 28,027,770 accessions are being conserved world-wide by 446 organizations represented in Genesys; of these, 3.78% (100,607) are Indian-origin accessions. Similarly, 62,920 Indian-origin accessions (8.73%) have been conserved in CG genebanks which are accessible to the global research community for utilization in their respective crop improvement programmes. A total of 60 genebanks including 11 CG genebanks have deposited 824,625 accessions of PGR in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV) as safety duplicates; the average number of accessions deposited by each genebank is 13,744, and amongst them there are 66,339 Indian-origin accessions. In principle, India has contributed 4.85 times the number of germplasm accessions to SGSV, in comparison to the mean value (13,744) of any individual genebank including CG genebanks. More importantly, about 50% of the Indian-origin accessions deposited in SGSV are traditional varieties or landraces with defined traits which form the backbone of any crop gene pool. This paper is also attempting to correlate the global data on Indian-origin germplasm with the national germplasm export profile. The analysis from this paper is discussed with the perspective of possible implications in the access and benefit sharing regime of both the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and the newly enforced Nagoya Protocol under the Convention on Biological Diversity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Article; Bioinformatics; Conservation Genetics; Controlled Study; Crop Improvement; Crop Production; Data Analysis; Gene Bank; Gene Pool; Gene Sequence; Genetic Conservation; Genetic Database; Genetic Resource; Geographic Origin; Germplasm; Health Care Facility; India; Information Storage; Nonhuman; Plant Genetics; Program Development; Sequence Homology; Biodiversity; Genetics; International Cooperation; Plant; Plant Seed; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Databases, Genetic; International Cooperation; Plants; Seeds","agriculture; Article; bioinformatics; conservation genetics; controlled study; crop improvement; crop production; data analysis; gene bank; gene pool; gene sequence; genetic conservation; genetic database; genetic resource; geographic origin; germplasm; health care facility; India; information storage; nonhuman; plant genetics; program development; sequence homology; biodiversity; genetics; international cooperation; plant; plant seed; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Databases, Genetic; International Cooperation; Plants; Seeds","","","","undefined, (1993); Ungricht, Stefan, How many plant species are there?

It affects water and energy balances and consequently the microclimate in irrigated regions. Therefore, knowledge of the extent of irrigated land is important for hydrological and crop modelling, global change research, and assessments of resource use and management. Information on the historical evolution of irrigated lands is limited. The new global historical irrigation data set (HID) provides estimates of the temporal development of the area equipped for irrigation (AEI) between 1900 and 2005 at 5 arcmin resolution. We collected sub-national irrigation statistics from various sources and found that the global extent of AEI increased from 63 million ha (Mha) in 1900 to 111 Mha in 1950 and 306 Mha in 2005. We developed eight gridded versions of time series of AEI by combining sub-national irrigation statistics with different data sets on the historical extent of cropland and pasture. Different rules were applied to maximize consistency of the gridded products to sub-national irrigation statistics or to historical cropland and pasture data sets. The HID reflects very well the spatial patterns of irrigated land as shown on historical maps for the western United States (around year 1900) and on a global map (around year 1960). Mean aridity on irrigated land increased and mean natural river discharge on irrigated land decreased from 1900 to 1950 whereas aridity decreased and river discharge remained approximately constant from 1950 to 2005.

In recent years, the availability of truly global data-sets has allowed for the application of climatic types, including the Kppen-Geiger system, over the oceans. This research uses NCAR Reanalysis data to create a global Extended Kppen-Geiger climate classification, including the world ocean, for the 1981-2010 averaging period. The percentages of Earths surface covered by tropical rainforest (Af), tropical monsoon (Am), and (especially) the mesothermal-mild summer (Cfc) climate types are much larger than in the terrestrial only analysis. Expanding and contracting terrestrial climate zones are also identified based on the differences in the total area through comparison with maps produced for 1901-1925, 1926-1950, 1951-1975, 1976-2000 and model-output-based predicted Kppen-Geiger types for 2076-2100. Results suggest that hot desert (BWh), hot semi-arid (BSh), and Af climatic types are projected to expand, while the tundra and most mesothermal and microthermal types will decrease in area. These results assist in projecting global impacts of climatic change. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Types; Climatic Change; Extended Koppen-geiger Climatic Classification System; Climate Change; Climate Classification; Global Climate; Terrestrial Environment","climate change; climate classification; global climate; terrestrial environment","","","","Anyadike, Raymond N.C., A multivariate classification and regionalization of west African climates, Journal of Climatology, 7, 2, pp. 157-164, (1987); Aspinall, Richard J., A century of physical geography research in the Annals, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 100, 5, pp. 1049-1059, (2010); Baker, Barry B., Use of the Köppen-Trewartha climate classification to evaluate climatic refugia in statistically derived ecoregions for the People's Republic of China, Climatic Change, 98, 1-2, pp. 113-131, (2009); Ballinger, Thomas J., The polar marine climate revisited, Journal of Climate, 26, 11, pp. 3935-3952, (2013); Climate Status Report 2004, (2005); Klimastatusbericht, (2005); Annals of the Association of American Geographers, (1967); Chang, Jenhu, An evaluation of the 1948 thornthwaite classification, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 49, 1, pp. 24-30, (1959); Chen, Deliang, Using the Köppen classification to quantify climate variation and change: An example for 1901-2010, Environmental Development, 6, 1, pp. 69-79, (2013); Cheung, William W.L., Large-scale redistribution of maximum fisheries catch potential in the global ocean under climate change, Global Change Biology, 16, 1, pp. 24-35, (2010)","","Taylor and Francis Inc. 325 Chestnut St, Suite 800 Philadelphia PA 19106","","","","","","02723646","063111081X; 9782130447351; 213044735X; 9780631110811","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988268326"

Among the various methods to estimate root turnover, the root's radiocarbon signature has rarely been applied to grassland soils previously, although the value of this approach is known from studies in forest soils. In this paper, we utilize the root's radiocarbon signatures, at 25 plots, in mountain grasslands of the montane to alpine zone of Europe.We place the results in context of a global data base on root turnover and discuss driving factors. Root turnover rates were similar to those of a subsample of the global data, comprising a similar temperature range, but measured with different approaches, indicating that the radiocarbon method gives reliable, plausible and comparable results. Root turnover rates (0.06-1.0 y-1) scaled significantly and exponentially with mean annual temperatures. Root turnover rates indicated no trend with soil depth. The temperature sensitivity was significantly higher in mountain grassland, compared to the global data set, suggesting additional factors influencing root turnover. Information on management intensity from the 25 plots reveals that root turnover may be accelerated under intensive and moderate management compared to low intensity or semi-natural conditions. Because management intensity, in the studied ecosystems, co-varied with temperature, estimates on root turnover, based on mean annual temperature alone, may be biased. A greater recognition of management as a driver for root dynamics is warranted when effects of climatic change on belowground carbon dynamics are studied in mountain grasslands. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon 14; Carbon; Carbon; Carbon Radioisotopes; Soil; Carbon 14; Carbon; Soil; Article; Controlled Study; Ecological Phenomena And Functions; Ecosystem; Environmental Management; Environmental Temperature; Europe; Grassland; Mountain; Root Turnover; Soil Analysis; Temperature Dependence; Temperature Sensitivity; Agriculture; Altitude; Carbon Cycle; Chemistry; Climate Change; Human; Metabolism; Plant Root; Poaceae; Statistical Model; Temperature; Agriculture; Altitude; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Radioisotopes; Climate Change; Grassland; Humans; Models, Statistical; Plant Roots; Soil; Temperature","carbon 14; carbon; soil; Article; controlled study; ecological phenomena and functions; ecosystem; environmental management; environmental temperature; Europe; grassland; mountain; root turnover; soil analysis; temperature dependence; temperature sensitivity; agriculture; altitude; carbon cycle; chemistry; climate change; human; metabolism; plant root; Poaceae; statistical model; temperature; Agriculture; Altitude; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Radioisotopes; Climate Change; Grassland; Humans; Models, Statistical; Plant Roots; Soil; Temperature","","carbon 14, 14762-75-5; carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon; Carbon Radioisotopes; Soil","","Bolinder, Martin Anders, An approach for estimating net primary productivity and annual carbon inputs to soil for common agricultural crops in Canada, Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 118, 1-4, pp. 29-42, (2007); Crow, Susan E., Sources of plant-derived carbon and stability of organic matter in soil: Implications for global change, Global Change Biology, 15, 8, pp. 2003-2019, (2009); Rasse, Daniel P., Is soil carbon mostly root carbon?

Carbon fluxes from land to rivers have probably increased by 0.1 to 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year as a result of disturbances such as deforestation, agricultural intensification and the injection of human wastewater. Most dissolved organic carbon in rivers originates from young organic carbon from soils and vegetation, but aged carbon removed from the modern carbon cycle is also exported in many systems. Here we analyse a global data set of radiocarbon ages of riverine dissolved organic carbon and spatial data on land cover, population and environmental variables. We find that the age of dissolved organic carbon in rivers increases with population density and the proportion of human-dominated landscapes within a watershed, and decreases with annual precipitation. We reason that disturbance reintroduces aged soil organic matter into the modern carbon cycle, although fossil carbon in fertilizer or petroleum products may also be a source of aged carbon in disturbed watersheds. The total export from the terrestrial environment to freshwater systems remains unknown; nevertheless, our results suggest that 3-9% of dissolved organic carbon in rivers is aged carbon mobilized by human disturbance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anthropogenic Effect; Aquatic Ecosystem; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Dissolved Organic Carbon; Estimation Method; Land Use Change; Precipitation (climatology)","anthropogenic effect; aquatic ecosystem; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; dissolved organic carbon; estimation method; land use change; precipitation (climatology)","","","We want to thank C.

As targeting individuals alone does not seem to be an effective strategy to reduce maternal mortality (Millennium Development Goal 5), the present study sought to reveal the role of many distant macrostructural factors affecting maternal mortality at the global level. Methods: After preparing a global dataset, 439 indicators were selected from nearly 1800 indicators based on their relevance and the application of proper inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to assess the relationship between these indicators and maternal mortality. Only indicators with statistically significant correlation more than 0.2, and missing values less than 20% were maintained. Due to the high multicollinearity among the remaining indicators, after missing values analysis and imputation, factor analysis was performed with principal component analysis as the method of extraction. Ten factors were finally extracted and entered into a multiple regression analysis. Results: The findings of this study not only consolidated the results of earlier studies about maternal mortality, but also added new evidence. Education (std. B=-0.442), private sector and trade (std. B=-0.316), and governance (std. B=-0.280) were found to be the most important macrostructural factors associated with maternal mortality. Employment and labor structure, economic policy and debt, agriculture and food production, private sector infrastructure investment, and health finance were also some other critical factors. These distal factors explained about 65% of the variability in maternal mortality between different countries. Conclusion: Decreasing maternal mortality requires dealing with various factors other than individual determinants including political will, reallocation of national resources (especially health resources) in the governmental sector, education, attention to the expansion of the private sector trade and improving spectrums of governance. In other words, sustainable reduction in maternal mortality (as a development indicator) will depend on long-term planning for multi-faceted development. Moreover, trade, debt, political stability, and strength of legal rights can be affected by elements outside the borders of countries and global determinants. These findings are believed to be beneficial for sustainable development in Post-2015 Development Agenda. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Education; Global Data; Governance; Macrostructural Indicators; Maternal Mortality; Post-2015 Development; Education; Governance Approach; Health Care; Maternal Mortality; Millenium Development Goal; Sustainable Development; United Nations Development Program; Article; Clinical Indicator; Controlled Study; Crop Production; Data Analysis; Educational Status; Employment Status; Female; Financial Deficit; Food Industry; Health Care Cost; Health Care Policy; Health Care Quality; Human; Medical Society; Organizational Downsizing; Organizational Efficiency; Outcome Assessment; Priority Journal; Women's Health; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-sectional Study; Health; Health Status Indicator; Middle Aged; Trends; Young Adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-sectional Studies; Female; Global Health; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Maternal Mortality; Middle Aged; Young Adult","education; governance approach; health care; maternal mortality; Millenium Development Goal; sustainable development; United Nations Development Program; Article; clinical indicator; controlled study; crop production; data analysis; educational status; employment status; female; financial deficit; food industry; health care cost; health care policy; health care quality; human; medical society; organizational downsizing; organizational efficiency; outcome assessment; priority journal; women's health; adolescent; adult; cross-sectional study; health; health status indicator; middle aged; trends; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Global Health; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Maternal Mortality; Middle Aged; Young Adult","","","","Wilmoth, John R., A New Method for Deriving Global Estimates of Maternal Mortality, Statistics, Politics and Policy, 3, 2, (2012); United Nations Millennium Declaration, (2000); Ronsmans, Carine, Maternal mortality: who, when, where, and why, The Lancet, 368, 9542, pp. 1189-1200, (2006); Millennium Development Goals Report, (2009); Millennium Development Goals at Midpoint Where do We Stand and Where do We Need to Go, (2008); Trends in Maternal Mortality 1990 to 2008, (2010); Gil-González, Diana, Knowledge gaps in scientific literature on maternal mortality: A systematic review, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 84, 11, pp. 903-909, (2006); Strategies to Reduce Pregnancy Related Deaths from Identification and Review to Action, (2001); Trends in Maternal Mortality 1990 2008, (2010); Modern Epidemiology, (1998)","","BioMed Central Ltd. info@biomedcentral.com","","","","","","17448603","9780195172997; 9780199865659","","25517376","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925299769"

It plays a vital role in satisfying basic needs for drinking water, agriculture and industrial activities. During times of drought groundwater sustains baseflow to rivers and wetlands, thereby supporting ecosystems. Most global-scale hydrological models (GHMs) do not include a groundwater flow component, mainly due to lack of geohydrological data at the global scale. For the simulation of lateral flow and groundwater head dynamics, a realistic physical representation of the groundwater system is needed, especially for GHMs that run at finer resolutions. In this study we present a global-scale groundwater model (run at 6' resolution) using MODFLOW to construct an equilibrium water table at its natural state as the result of long-term climatic forcing. The used aquifer schematization and properties are based on available global data sets of lithology and transmissivities combined with the estimated thickness of an upper, unconfined aquifer. This model is forced with outputs from the land-surface PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) model, specifically net recharge and surface water levels. A sensitivity analysis, in which the model was run with various parameter settings, showed that variation in saturated conductivity has the largest impact on the groundwater levels simulated. Validation with observed groundwater heads showed that groundwater heads are reasonably well simulated for many regions of the world, especially for sediment basins (R2= 0.95). The simulated regional-scale groundwater patterns and flow paths demonstrate the relevance of lateral groundwater flow in GHMs. Inter-basin groundwater flows can be a significant part of a basin's water budget and help to sustain river baseflows, especially during droughts. Also, water availability of larger aquifer systems can be positively affected by additional recharge from inter-basin groundwater flows. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aquifers; Budget Control; Drought; Groundwater; Groundwater Flow; Groundwater Resources; Lithology; Potable Water; Sensitivity Analysis; Surface Waters; Water; Water Levels; Groundwater Modeling; Groundwater System; Hydrological Models; Industrial Activities; Parameter Setting; Saturated Conductivity; Unconfined Aquifers; Water Availability; Recharging (underground Waters); Agricultural Practice; Aquifer Characterization; Baseflow; Climate Forcing; Drinking Water; Global Change; Hydrogeology; Industrial Practice; Recharge; Water Budget","Aquifers; Budget control; Drought; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Lithology; Potable water; Sensitivity analysis; Surface waters; Water; Water levels; Groundwater modeling; Groundwater system; Hydrological models; Industrial activities; Parameter setting; Saturated conductivity; Unconfined aquifers; Water availability; Recharging (underground waters); agricultural practice; aquifer characterization; baseflow; climate forcing; drinking water; global change; hydrogeology; industrial practice; recharge; water budget","","","","Beven, Keith J., Considerations in the development and validation of a simple physically based, variable contributing area model of catchment hydrology., pp. 23-36, (1979); Bierkens, Marc F.P., Groundwater convergence as a possible mechanism for multi-year persistence in rainfall, Geophysical Research Letters, 34, 2, (2007); Groundwater Availability of the Mississippi Embayment, (2011); de Graaf, Inge E.M., Dynamic attribution of global water demand to surface water and groundwater resources: Effects of abstractions and return flows on river discharges, Advances in Water Resources, 64, pp. 21-33, (2014); Dee, Dick P., The ERA-Interim reanalysis: Configuration and performance of the data assimilation system, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 137, 656, pp. 553-597, (2011); Dürr, Hans H., Lithologic composition of the Earth's continental surfaces derived from a new digital map emphasizing riverine material transfer, Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 19, 4, (2005); Fan, Ying, Incorporating water table dynamics in climate modeling: 1.

Information on the distribution and performance of specific crops is often only available through national or subnational statistics. Recently, however, there have been multiple independent efforts to incorporate the detailed information available from statistical surveys with supplemental spatial information to produce a spatially explicit global dataset specific to individual crops. While these datasets provide decision makers with improved information on global cropping systems, the final global cropping maps differ substantially from one another. This study aims to explore and quantify systematic similarities and differences between four major global cropping systems products and the subsequent implications for analyses dependent on those models. Location: This study was conducted at a global scale. Methods: Each global cropping systems model was assessed by latitude as a measure of biophysical plausibility and each pair of models was compared using a Gaussian filter to remove trivial spatial discrepancies. Model disagreement was explored in relation to the interdependent input data of each model pair with a particular focus on cropland extent. The influence of the observed model differences on subsequent analyses was demonstrated using model-dependent estimates of the yield gap as an example. Results: The results of our analysis indicate that the choice of cropping systems model is non-trivial: considerable differences exist between model-specific estimates of the yield gap across nearly all climate zones and the average model difference exceeds the average estimated yield gap in certain regions. The differences in crop-specific harvested area and yield products of each model are significant, and mostly result from differences in the input datasets and downscaling methodologies. In particular, the choice of dataset on cropland extent proved to be influential regardless of the downscaling process employed. Main conclusions: Discrepancies in the final products of cropping systems models are currently poorly understood, but have implications for basic policy decisions relating to agricultural production and food security. The considerable disagreement between models serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges to the creation of spatially explicit estimates of harvested area and yield based on crop statistics. Our analysis helps shed light on the importance of model choice by demonstrating the implications for further analyses that depend on cropping systems models, and works to overcome these challenges by characterizing model-dependent differences in harvested area and yield. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cropping Systems; Gaez; Global Cropland; Harvested Area; M3; Mirca; Spam; Yield; Yield Gap; Agricultural Land; Agricultural Production; Crop Performance; Crop Yield; Cropping Practice; Food Security","agricultural land; agricultural production; crop performance; crop yield; cropping practice; food security","","","","Bondeau, Alberte, Modelling the role of agriculture for the 20th century global terrestrial carbon balance, Global Change Biology, 13, 3, pp. 679-706, (2007); Center for International Earth Science Information Network Ciesin, (2000); undefined, (2004); Glob Biogeochem Cycles, (2011); FAO Forestry Paper 140, (2001); Global Agro Ecological Zones Gaez V3 0, (2025); Foley, Jonathan A., Global consequences of land use, Science, 309, 5734, pp. 570-574, (2005); Foley, Jonathan A., Solutions for a cultivated planet, Nature, 478, 7369, pp. 337-342, (2011); Friedl, Mark A., Global land cover mapping from MODIS: Algorithms and early results, Remote Sensing of Environment, 83, 1-2, pp. 287-302, (2002); Fritz, Steffen, Identifying and quantifying uncertainty and spatial disagreement in the comparison of Global Land Cover for different applications, Global Change Biology, 14, 5, pp. 1057-1075, (2008)","","","","","","","","1466822X; 14668238","","GEBIF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922588904"

In this context, hyperspectral imaging offers a particularly promising approach since it provides non-destructive measurements of plants correlated with internal structure and biochemical compounds. In this paper, we present a cascade of data mining techniques for fast and reliable data-driven sketching of complex hyperspectral dynamics in plant science and plant phenotyping. To achieve this, we build on top of a recent linear time matrix factorization technique, called Simplex Volume Maximization, in order to automatically discover archetypal hyperspectral signatures that are characteristic for particular diseases. The methods were applied on a data set of barley leaves (Hordeum vulgare) diseased with foliar plant pathogens Pyrenophora teres, Puccinia hordei and Blumeria graminis hordei . Towards more intuitive visualizations of plant disease dynamics, we use the archetypal signatures to create structured summaries that are inspired by metro maps, i.e. schematic diagrams of public transport networks. Metro maps of plant disease dynamics produced on several real-world data sets conform to plant physiological knowledge and explicitly illustrate the interaction between diseases and plants. Most importantly, they provide an abstract and interpretable view on plant disease progression. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accuracy; Article; Automation; Barley; Blumeria Graminis; Controlled Study; Data Mining; Hyperspectral Imaging; Image Analysis; Imaging And Display; Machine Learning; Metro Map; Nonhuman; Pathogenesis; Phenotype; Plant Disease; Plant Leaf; Plant Physiology; Puccinia; Puccinia Hordei; Pyrenophora Teres; Ascomycetes; Comparative Study; Hordeum; Host Pathogen Interaction; Microbiology; Near Infrared Spectroscopy; Hordeum Vulgare; Ascomycota; Data Mining; Host-pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Spectroscopy, Near-infrared","accuracy; Article; automation; barley; Blumeria graminis; controlled study; data mining; hyperspectral imaging; image analysis; imaging and display; machine learning; metro map; nonhuman; pathogenesis; phenotype; plant disease; plant leaf; plant physiology; Puccinia; Puccinia hordei; Pyrenophora teres; Ascomycetes; comparative study; Hordeum; host pathogen interaction; microbiology; near infrared spectroscopy; Hordeum vulgare; Ascomycota; Data Mining; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared","","","","Strange, Richard N., Plant disease: A threat to global food security, Annual Review of Phytopathology, 43, pp. 83-116, (2005); Oerke, Erich Christian, Safeguarding production - Losses in major crops and the role of crop protection, Crop Protection, 23, 4, pp. 275-285, (2004); Richards, Richards A., Breeding for improved water productivity in temperate cereals: Phenotyping, quantitative trait loci, markers and the selection environment, Functional Plant Biology, 37, 2, pp. 85-97, (2010); Purves, Drew W., Ecosystems: Time to model all life on Earth, Nature, 493, 7432, pp. 295-297, (2013); Berger, Bettina, High-throughput shoot imaging to study drought responses, Journal of Experimental Botany, 61, 13, pp. 3519-3528, (2010); Granier, Christine, Phenotyping and beyond: Modelling the relationships between traits, Current Opinion in Plant Biology, 18, 1, pp. 96-102, (2014); Furbank, Robert T., Phenomics - technologies to relieve the phenotyping bottleneck, Trends in Plant Science, 16, 12, pp. 635-644, (2011); Mahlein, Anne Katrin, Recent advances in sensing plant diseases for precision crop protection, European Journal of Plant Pathology, 133, 1, pp. 197-209, (2012); Fiorani, Fabio, Future scenarios for plant phenotyping, Annual Review of Plant Biology, 64, pp. 267-291, (2013); Gitelson, Anatoly A., Signature analysis of leaf reflectance spectra: Algorithm development for remote sensing of chlorophyll, Journal of Plant Physiology, 148, 3-4, pp. 494-500, (1996)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","25621489","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921900726"

The Ba River basin, which is located in the Western part of the main island, Viti Levu, has experienced severe floods and droughts. The flood record of the Ba River extends from 1871 to 2009 and reports flooding of about 127 times with the most disastrous floods in 1931, 1956, 1993, 1999 and 2009 (McGree et al., 2010). For example, the 1993 flood damages amounted to about 8 million USD. For the past droughts, the rain fed sugar cane agriculture is affected by shortages of precipitation with the most severe drought in 1998. In the Ba River basin, the sugar cane agriculture recorded a loss of 21.80 km2 at the Rarawai Mill during the 1998 drought. For the flood hazard reduction, a dry dam infrastructure is proposed upstream of the Ba Town allowing for natural river flows while only reducing flood peaks. In addition, two multipurpose dams are proposed for the water supply during droughts as well as flood reduction. In our approach, we utilize numerical models to investigate the effectiveness of dam infrastructure for flood control and water supply, and standardized indices to characterize historical droughts. For the standardized indices, the precipitation record of the Ba River basin has been investigated with the use of Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) from 1960 to 2009 and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was obtained from global datasets. The 3-arcsecond (about 90-m) grid block-wise TOP (BTOP) and 15-arcsecond (about 450-m) grid rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) models were constructed for the Ba river basin of 957 km2 to simulate flood river flows and inundation. For the BTOP model, monthly potential evapotranspiration and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were obtained using climate forcing data CRU TS3.1. Both BTOP and RRI models with short- and long-term local precipitation data were calibrated and validated with the local available data at two river gauging stations. Using the simulated discharges of the calibrated BTOP model, we estimated flood discharges of the selected return periods with flood frequency analysis and conducted flood inundation simulations with Flood Inundation Model (FID) model. The estimated flood inundation area and flood exposure with and without infrastructure are utilized for the flood risk estimation. For flood risk, we estimated the number of flood affected people and agriculture and found a satisfactory comparison with the record of the 1993 flood. For the historical drought assessment, both SPI and SPEI demonstrated the most extreme drought conditions of the 1998 drought and are consistent with the affected agriculture record during the 1998 drought. These preliminary results indicate the usefulness of our approach and suggest it could be used for selecting effective counter-measures for flood and drought risk reduction in Ba River basin. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Btop Model; Flood Inundation; Rri Model; Standardized Indices; Barium; Climate Models; Dams; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Flood Control; Operations Research; Rain; Risk Assessment; Risk Perception; Rivers; Runoff; Stream Flow; Sugar Cane; Water Supply; Watersheds; Flood Frequency Analysis; Flood Inundation Modeling; Inundation Simulations; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Potential Evapotranspiration; Simulated Discharges; Standardized Indices; Standardized Precipitation Index; Floods","Barium; Climate models; Dams; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Flood control; Operations research; Rain; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Rivers; Runoff; Stream flow; Sugar cane; Water supply; Watersheds; Flood frequency analysis; Flood inundation modeling; Inundation simulations; Normalized difference vegetation index; Potential evapotranspiration; Simulated discharges; Standardized indices; Standardized precipitation index; Floods","","","","Population by Age Race and Province of Enumeration Fiji 2007 Census, (2015); Gusyev, Maksym A., Effectiveness of water infrastructure for river flood management - Part 1: Flood hazard assessment using hydrological models in Bangladesh, 370, pp. 75-81, (2015); Gusyev, Maksym A., Drought assessment in the Pampanga River basin, the Philippines - Part 1: Characterizing a role of dams in historical droughts with standardized indices, pp. 1586-1592, (2015); Proc 21st Int Congress on Modelling and Simulation Modsim 2015, (2015); Harris, Ian C., Updated high-resolution grids of monthly climatic observations - the CRU TS3.10 Dataset, International Journal of Climatology, 34, 3, pp. 623-642, (2014); Study on Watershed Management and Flood Control for the Four Major Viti Levu Rivers in the Republic of Fiji Islands, (1998); Undac Mission Report Fiji Drought, (1998); Hydrol Res Lett, (2012); Lehner, Bernhard, New global hydrography derived from spaceborne elevation data, Eos, 89, 10, pp. 93-94, (2008); Regional El Nino Social and Economic Drought Impact Assessment and Mitigation, (1999)","Weber, T.; McPhee, M.; Anderssen, R.","Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand Inc.

The Malwathoya River Basin is the second largest basin in Sri Lanka with an area of 3,246 km2 located in the dry zone of northern Sri Lanka. The river basin has an average annual rainfall of 1200 mm with two distinct dry and wet seasons and has an elevation range between 350 above mean sea level (AMSL) in the mountainous areas and 0 AMSL near the sea shore. For the lower part of the river basin, the dry season rice production of 170 km2 area cannot be fully utilized due to annual precipitation of less than 750 mm and lack of irrigation water, which is diverted from the Malwathu River at the Thekkam diversion weir to large water storage tanks via a cascaded irrigation scheme. In the wet season, the rice paddies are frequently flooded due to intense rainfall from the North East monsoon between October and January as well as the inter monsoon during April causing severe economic losses during 2012 and 2014 floods. As a result, a multi-purpose dam with the capacity of 210 million cubic meters (MCM) was proposed in the middle of the Malwathoya River Basin to reduce flood peak discharges during wet season and to supply irrigation water for the Thekkam diversion weir during dry season. In our methodology, a holistic approach of combined drought and flood assessment is adopted for the multipurpose dam operation. From this point of view, opposite actions are required for the risk reductions: the full reservoir storage should be maintained before the start of the dry season and the low levels are necessary for the flood peak reduction during flood season. For the hazard severity assessment, the long-term precipitation record has been investigated with the use of Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as well of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) to select the most severe dry and wet seasons. In addition, past agricultural damages caused by 2012-2014 floods and droughts were correlated using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) with field data at several locations. For the dam operation simulation, the 30-arcsec (about 1-km) grid distributed hydrological model BTOP was constructed from the global data sets and included reservoirs and medium water storage tanks with total capacity of 540 MCM located upstream of the Thekkam diversion weir. The BTOP model simulation with the ground-based precipitation was calibrated with observed river discharge data at the diversion weir and had a satisfactory statistical performance. Then, the calibrated BTOP model was used to simulate multi-purpose dam operation with the short- and long-term precipitation. From the BTOP model results, the proposed dam allowed us to establish an optimum operation for the flood and drought risk reduction and indicated a decrease in water related hazards. In addition, we estimated a standardized inflow index (SII) and a standardized reservoir storage index (SRSI) from the BTOP simulated reservoir inflows and water storage to demonstrate long-term dam performance on the same scale with SPI and SPEI values. As a result, this study demonstrates a combined flood and drought risk assessment from the water resources infrastructure point of view and allows us to reduce farmers' vulnerability in the northern region of Sri Lanka. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agricultural Drought; Btop Model; Flood Discharge; Sii; Spei; Spi; Srsi; Atmospheric Thermodynamics; Digital Storage; Drought; Flood Control; Floods; Hazards; Irrigation; Losses; Operations Research; Rain; Risk Assessment; Rivers; Sea Level; Stream Flow; Water Supply; Water Tanks; Watersheds; Weirs; Above Mean Sea Level (amsl); Agricultural Drought; Distributed Hydrological Model; Flood Discharge; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Spei; Srsi; Standardized Precipitation Index; Reservoirs (water)","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Digital storage; Drought; Flood control; Floods; Hazards; Irrigation; Losses; Operations research; Rain; Risk assessment; Rivers; Sea level; Stream flow; Water supply; Water tanks; Watersheds; Weirs; Above mean sea level (amsl); Agricultural drought; Distributed hydrological model; Flood discharge; Normalized difference vegetation index; SPEI; SRSI; Standardized precipitation index; Reservoirs (water)","","","","Village Tanks Cascade Systems of Sri Lanka, (2009); Chandrasekar, K., Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) response to rainfall and NDVI using the MODIS vegetation index product, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 31, 15, pp. 3987-4005, (2010); Progress Report, (2025); Crop Evapotranspiration, (1998); Gusyev, Maksym A., Drought assessment in the Pampanga River basin, the Philippines - Part 1: Characterizing a role of dams in historical droughts with standardized indices, pp. 1586-1592, (2015); Proc 21st Int Congress on Modelling and Simulation Modsim 2015, (2015); Lehner, Bernhard, New global hydrography derived from spaceborne elevation data, Eos, 89, 10, pp. 93-94, (2008); Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, (2015); 8th Conference on Applied Climatology, (1993); Assessment of the Proposed Malwathoya Dam for Flood and Drought Mitigation in the Lower Malwathoya River Basin Sri Lanka, (2015)","Weber, T.; McPhee, M.; Anderssen, R.","Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand Inc.

It is also important in other application areas such as hydrology, urban environmental monitoring, agriculture, ecological and bushfire monitoring. Many studies have shown that it is possible to retrieve T<inf>s</inf> globally using thermal infrared data from satellites. Development of standard methodologies that routinely generate T<inf>s</inf> products would be of broad benefit to the utility of remote sensing data in applications such as hydrology and urban monitoring. AVHRR and MODIS datasets are routinely used to deliver T<inf>s</inf> products. However, these data have a 1 km spatial resolution, which is too coarse to detect the detailed variation of land surface change of concern in many applications, especially in heterogeneous areas. Higher resolution thermal data from Landsat (60-120 m) is a possible option in such cases. To derive T<inf>s</inf>, two scientific problems need to be addressed, the first of which is the focus of this paper: • Remove the atmospheric effects and derive surface brightness temperature (T<inf>B</inf>), • Separate the emissivity and T<inf>s</inf> effects in the surface brightness temperature (T<inf>B</inf>). For single thermal band sensors such as Landsat 5, 7 and due to a stray-light issue on Landsat-8, the multi-band methods used to derive T<inf>B</inf>, such as the split window methods used for NOAA-AVHRR data (Becker & Li, 1990) and the day/night pairs of thermal infrared data in several bands used for MODIS (Wan et al., 2002) are not available for correcting atmospheric effects. The inputs used for retrieval of surface brightness temperature T<inf>B</inf> from Landsat data therefore need more attention, as the accuracy of the T<inf>B</inf> retrieval depends critically on the ancillary data, such as atmospheric water vapour data (precipitable water). In the past, it has been more difficult to retrieve a reliable T<inf>B</inf> product routinely from Landsat due to limited availability (time and space) of accurate atmospheric water vapour information. To test the possibility for retrieving a good quality T<inf>B</inf> product routinely from Landsat, in this paper, T<inf>B</inf> products are derived from four current and routinely available global atmospheric profiles, namely the NASA Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA); the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis I, the National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis II and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim reanalysis. These products were evaluated against the T<inf>B</inf> derived from the near coincident ground-released radiosonde data (balloon data) using a physically based radiative transfer model MODTRAN 5. The results from this comparison have found: • The global data sets NCEP1, NCEP2, MERRA and ECMWF can all generally give satisfactory T<inf>B</inf> products and can meet the 1 K accuracy levels demanded by many practitioners. • The ECMWF data set performs best. The root mean square difference (RMSD) for the 9 days and 3 test sites are all within 0.4 K when compared with the T<inf>B</inf> products estimated using ground-released radiosonde measurements. The results show that using single thermal band Landsat, accurate T<inf>B</inf> can be delivered operationally using a robust physically based radiative transfer model such as MODTRAN 5 and operationally available global atmospheric profiles, particularly the ECMWF interim reanalysis data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Atmospheric Correction; Landsat; Precipitable Water; Surface Brightness Temperature; Atmospheric Temperature; Hydrology; Infrared Radiation; Luminance; Moisture; Nasa; Operations Research; Quality Control; Radiative Transfer; Radiometers; Radiosondes; Remote Sensing; Stray Light; Surface Measurement; Water Vapor; Weather Forecasting; Atmospheric Corrections; European Centre For Medium-range Weather Forecasts; Landsat; National Center For Environmental Predictions; Precipitable Water; Radiative Transfer Model; Root Mean Square Differences; Surface Brightness Temperature; Land Surface Temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Hydrology; Infrared radiation; Luminance; Moisture; NASA; Operations research; Quality control; Radiative transfer; Radiometers; Radiosondes; Remote sensing; Stray light; Surface measurement; Water vapor; Weather forecasting; Atmospheric corrections; European centre for medium-range weather forecasts; LANDSAT; National center for environmental predictions; Precipitable water; Radiative transfer model; Root mean square differences; Surface brightness temperature; Land surface temperature","","","This paper is published with the permission of the CEO, Geoscience Australia (GA) and the permission of CSIRO.

In this study, we analyzed inventory LCLU records from Department of Economics and Statistics (DES) and remote-sensing-based data sets obtained from Resourcesat-1, MODIS, Globcover, and HYDE 3.1 for 2005 in India. Based on the DES and Resourcesat-1 data sets, the best estimate of agricultural area was 143 million ha which was lower than MODIS and Globcover data sets (158–167 million ha). Global data sets have underestimated forest area by 20–30 million ha, comparing to DES and Resourcesat-1 data sets (63–66 million ha). All the remote sensing data sets showed a wide range for urban area (1.5–8.4 million ha) which was lower than inventory data sets. Our results caution scientific community and policymakers to carefully use global LCLU data sets that are significantly different from DES records in India. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Census Data; India; Land Cover And Land Use; Remote Sensing","","","","This study has been supported by NASA LCLUC program (NNX08AL73G_S01), NASA (NNX11AR20G), NSF Decadal and Regional Climate Prediction using Earth System Models (AGS-1243220), and NSF (NSF: CNS-1059376).","Arinò, Olivier, GlobCover: The most detailed portrait of Earth, European Space Agency Bulletin, 2008, 136, pp. 24-31, (2008); Bartholomé, Etienne, GLC2000: A new approach to global land cover mapping from earth observation data, International Journal of Remote Sensing, 26, 9, pp. 1959-1977, (2005); undefined, (2005); DeFries, Ruth S., Continuous fields of vegetation characteristics at the global scale at 1-km resolution, Journal of Geophysical Research, 104, D14, pp. 16911-16923, (1999); Department of Economics and Statistics India Des, (2010); Feddema, Johannes Jan, Atmospheric science: The importance of land-cover change in simulating future climates, Science, 310, 5754, pp. 1674-1678, (2005); Flint, Elizabeth P., Changes in land use in South and Southeast Asia from 1880 to 1980: A data base prepared as part of a coordinated research program on carbon fluxes in the tropics, Chemosphere, 29, 5, pp. 1015-1062, (1994); Friedl, Mark A., Global land cover mapping from MODIS: Algorithms and early results, Remote Sensing of Environment, 83, 1-2, pp. 287-302, (2002); Frolking, Steve E., Agricultural land-use in China: A comparison of area estimates from ground-based census and satellite-borne remote sensing, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 8, 5, pp. 407-416, (1999); Natasha, Gilbert, India’s forest area in doubt, Nature, 489, 7414, pp. 14-15, (2012)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. info@tandf.co.uk","","","","","","17474248; 1747423X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84918508876"
