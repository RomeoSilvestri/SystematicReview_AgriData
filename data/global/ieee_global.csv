Delivery of timely and accurate soil moisture data can play a vital role in monitoring the status of available water reserves for this sector. Passive microwave sensors, such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), are well suited for monitoring vast landscapes given their all-weather capabilities, large spatial footprint, frequent revisit, and the sensitivity of microwave emissions to the soil dielectric. This study examines the impact of exploiting Canadian soil and land cover datasets in the retrieval of soil moisture from SMOS over an agricultural area in the province of Manitoba (Canada). Results demonstrate that global datasets that are integrated within the current SMOS processor perform adequately when field measured soil moisture is compared to estimates of soil moisture by SMOS (R2 of 0.70 (p <; .01) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 7.15% with a negative (dry) bias of -0.05%). Overall, this study showed that ingesting high-quality national datasets into the SMOS soil moisture retrieval algorithm did not fully resolve the underestimation of soil moisture, suggesting that further investigation is required to understand this bias. Also, several approaches were evaluated to improve statistical field-derived soil moisture representation in the validation of SMOS soil moisture retrieval and it is clear that good representation of soil moisture as a function of soil textures is crucial to accurately validate SMOS soil moisture products.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2417832","Canadian Space Agency (CSA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7117334","Agriculture;brightness temperature;land surface;monitoring;passive microwave remote sensing;surface texture;soil moisture;Agriculture;brightness temperature;land surface;monitoring;passive microwave remote sensing;surface texture;soil moisture","Soil moisture;Soil measurements;Agriculture;Soil texture;Moisture measurement;Passive microwave remote sensing;Brightness temperature","","14","","40","Crown","3 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The farmers are the backbone of the country; they play a vital role in feeding the entire population of the world. Farming is a beautiful relation between the farmer and the soil; the process of farming is an art that involves various techniques and practices, the productivity of the crop depends on various factors that include soil fertility, weather condition, harvesting period and the practices the farmer follow. In the current situation, the farmers are struggling to get an expected yield from the crop because of various reasons that include large climatic changes and lack of guidance. The objective of this study is to collect the historical data of agriculture, analyze them to predict the crop yield. With the advancement in today’s technology, it is possible to provide suggestion to the farmer regarding the crop selection and the practices to get expected crop yield. One such technique that is gaining more popularity in the field of agriculture is data mining. Data mining uses the large historical data sets to create a new pattern to obtain the knowledge that helps in suggesting the farmers on selecting the crops depending on various available parameters and also helps in estimating the production of the crops.","","978-1-6654-0482-2","10.1109/TEMSMET51618.2020.9557403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9557403","Farming;Farmer;Crop Selection;Crop yield;Soil fertility;weather condition;Crop prediction;Data mining","Productivity;Engineering management;Sociology;Crops;Entrepreneurship;Soil;Agriculture","","8","","26","IEEE","6 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the optical remote-sensing images often contain problematic pixels, such as those affected by thick clouds and its shadows, resulting a noisy time-series data which is inadequate to use for farmland analysis. Lack of the high quality noiseless time-series data products have been a bottleneck for many studies on farmland analysis using remote-sensing data in both of global and local scales. Hence we aims in this study to produce remote-sensing data archives containing noiseless smoothed time-series Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), and RGB composite (true color) image, covering global wide with the adequately downscaled 250-m resolution in 8-days interval from the period of 2000 to 2014 and up-to-date, derived from based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor images. The processing system for generating the global noiseless time-series data in this study is consist of four modules; image acquisition, preprocessing, noise reduction, and data archiving, implemented in Interactive Data Language (IDL) with PDP (Parallel Distributed Processing). Data products are derived from two sets of Terra/MODIS surface-reflectance 8-day composite data (MOD09Q1 v005 (250-m resolution) and MOD09A1 v005 (500-m resolution)) acquired from LP DAAC (Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center, USGS) on a regular basis automatically to update the latest products. To generate noiseless and smooth time-series data, we applied following well-established procedure: 1) Eliminate cloud and sensor noise pixels by referring the image quality information: 2) Reconstruct daily time-series data by referring the actual date of observation for each pixels: 3) Synthesize daily time-series Terra and Aqua: 4) Interpolate eliminated pixel value on time-series axis by liner interpolation method: 5) Apply the Savitzky-Golay filtering to time-series data to produce smoothed time-series data. Denoised true color image can be used for visually checking the quality of noise reduction. Data products are mapped by MODIS Sinusoidal Tiling System, and archived with Hierarchical Data Format-Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS) format containing various meta-information, which are the standard archive format for MODIS Land products distributed by USGS, so that users can use existing favorite tools such the MODIS Reprojection Tool (MRT) for handling the archives. The advanced noiseless time-series vegetation and water indices data archives produced in this study would contribute significantly to advanced analysis and monitoring of the crop production.","","978-1-4673-8087-4","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2015.7248132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7248132","EVI;LSWI;MODIS;NDVI;phenology;remote-sensing;true color image","MODIS;Vegetation mapping;Indexes;Remote sensing;Reflectivity;Distributed databases;Agriculture","","","","6","IEEE","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, computational capacity in real-world settings may be limited.

The effect of pre-processing, namely cropping unnecessary information and increasing contrast, is examined and experimentally shown to improve both accuracy and efficiency. Transfer learning is also leveraged for the deployment of Scaled YOLO v4, using pre-trained weights from the MS COCO data set, and shown to lead to a moderate improvement in accuracy. The proposed final model results in approximately 10% higher accuracy than the existing baseline model, on a representative subset of about half of images in the Open Plant Phenotyping Database. Experiments show that plant detection accuracy is improved for most well represented samples, with errors appearing in particularly challenging cases or caused by data imbalance. This shows the proposed method has significant potential for highly accurate and computationally efficient plant detection in real-world environments.","","978-1-6654-0533-1","10.1109/MetroAgriFor52389.2021.9628717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9628717","precision farming;object detection;transfer learning;YOLO;plant classification","Databases;Computational modeling;Plants (biology);Transfer learning;Object detection;Benchmark testing;Data models","","2","","18","IEEE","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study aimed to generate a high-resolution global MMLST product by temporally upscaling the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1-km instantaneous LST. First, six current methods were comprehensively evaluated using cross-validation technology. These six methods are the cross combinations of two temporal aggregation schemes: the average by observations (ABO) and average by days (ABD), and three conversion models: the diurnal temperature cycle model (DTC), the simple average of two instantaneous LSTs (TSA), and a weighted average model for multiple instantaneous LSTs (MWA). The analysis with measurements from 235 flux stations worldwide revealed that the choice of conversion model considerably affected the overall retrieval accuracy, whereas the influence of the aggregation scheme was minor. From the conversion model standpoint, MWA performed best, followed by DTC, and finally TSA; this order remained the same even if DTC and TSA were improved with mean bias correction. Notably, the errors of ABDMWA decreased as the number of daily mean LST (NOD) increased, whereas the errors of ABOMWA were not related to NOD. Accordingly, we deduced that the optimal strategy for estimating MMLST is using ABOMWA when NOD is < 20 and ABDMWA when NOD is  $\ge 20$ . Subsequently, we adopted this combination method to process MODIS instantaneous LSTs and produced a global 1-km MMLST dataset for the years 2003–2020. The validation showed a satisfactory accuracy with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.6 K. The intercomparison with MMLSTs from geostationary (GEO) satellites (containing complete LST daily cycle) presented a good agreement (biases < 0.3 K and STDs < 2 K). Compared with atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS) L3 monthly standard physical retrieval (AIRS3STM) product which had the same temporal span, the newly generated product exhibited a high consistency in reflecting temporal variations of global temperature. Most importantly, it had a prominently better ability to retrieve spatial details of temperature variations due to its higher resolution. Our new method and product show promising prospects for applications in global change studies, where accurate spatially resolved MMLST data are one of the fundamental geophysical variables required.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3247428","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41921001,42101371); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M680774); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10049535","Land surface temperature (LST);Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);monthly mean temperature;temporal upscaling","Land surface temperature;Satellites;Temperature measurement;MODIS;Temperature distribution;Atmospheric modeling;Spatial resolution","","12","","48","IEEE","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we describe a deep learning based method to allow a robot to perform an accurate weed/crop classification using a sequence of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to RGB images.

These systems rely heavily on accurate and comprehensive data to train effectively. However, current datasets often fall short of meeting the specific needs of these advanced agricultural technologies. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a primary contribution in the form of an open-source dataset focused on wheat rust disease segmentation for precision agriculture. Open-source datasets in literature are either general plant disease datasets or wheat disease classification datasets. Our proposed wheat rust segmentation dataset, Focussed Rust Disease Images (FRDI), provides close-up views of disease manifestations on wheat leaves, capturing the natural variability and complexity of diseases in field conditions, thereby meeting the requirements of precision agriculture systems. This facilitates detailed analysis and effective training of deep learning models designed for disease detection and segmentation tasks for real-world agricultural environments. Furthermore, in our work we present an improved wheat rust disease detection and segmentation technique which is based on the concept of co-salient feature extraction for disease identification within complex and cluttered field images. By integrating localized and generic contextual information, our proposed approach effectively identifies key features and intricate patterns associated with wheat rust disease.","","979-8-3503-7903-7","10.1109/DICTA63115.2024.00106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10869543","Precision agriculture;co-salient feature extraction;semantic segmentation;wheat rust disease detection;disease segmentation","Precision agriculture;Training;Deep learning;Representation learning;Productivity;Image segmentation;Plant diseases;Object detection;Feature extraction;Diseases","","1","","29","IEEE","13 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In regions where TCA is deemed unreliable, we use correlation significance levels ( $p$ -values) as indicator for retrieval quality to decide whether to use active data only, passive data only, or an unweighted average. We apply the proposed merging scheme to active retrievals from advanced scatterometer and passive retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer—Earth Observing System using Global Land Data Assimilation System-Noah to complement the triplet required for TCA. The merged time series is evaluated against soil moisture estimates from ERA-Interim/Land and in situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network using the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) current Climate Change Initiative—Soil Moisture (ESA CCI SM) product version v02.3 as benchmark merging scheme.

Our experimental results from real-world UAV images show that our leaf segmentation model using synthetic data from the CAS framework outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation models by 1.4-3.3%.

Specifically, a high spatial-resolution at 30-m Global Land Cover Data set with global coverage was employed as background data for image inversions, which further supported cloud detection in remote sensing images. Notably, threshold settings can be varied for different land cover types. Such an algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of cloud pixel identification for thin and broken clouds, even over bright areas. Moreover, Landsat 5 data are used to perform cloud detection experiments based on this algorithm. The thresholds are considering land cover variations. The thresholds of land cover types spatiotemporally vary, such as vegetation, differed by latitude and over time. In addition, six common land cover types are selected for cloud detection experiments. Then, validations analyses are conducted through visual interpretation and the results indicated that the algorithm is capable of achieving a high cloud detection accuracy.

These datasets offer insightful information on disease trends, soil nutrition demand of crops, and agricultural production history. By incorporating this knowledge, the model first recommends the list of primarily selected crops based on the soil nutrition of a particular user location. Then the predictions of meteorological variables like temperature, rainfall, and humidity are made using SARIMAX models. These weather predictions are then used to forecast the possibilities of diseases for the primary crops list by utilizing the support vector classifier. Finally, the developed model makes use of the decision tree regression model to forecast crop yield and provides a final crop list along with associated possible disease forecast. Utilizing the outcome of the model, farmers may choose the best productive crops as well as prevent crop diseases and reduce output losses by taking preventive actions. Consequently, planning and decision-making processes are supported and farmers can predict possible crop yields. Overall, by offering a detailed decision support system for crop selection and disease prediction, this work can play a vital role in advancing agricultural practices in Bangladesh.","","979-8-3503-5028-9","10.1109/iCACCESS61735.2024.10499459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499459","Agriculture;Crop suggesting model;SARIMAX;Crop production;Crop disease;Haversine formula;Machine learning","Economics;Temperature distribution;Rain;Weather forecasting;Production;Machine learning;Humidity","","2","","23","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional methodologies such as the Canny-Watershed (CW) algorithm require expert tuning of parameters for optimal results. This paper introduces an innovative approach for crop field segmentation in high-resolution satellite images, leveraging the use of multi-temporal Canny edge detection to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully automate the segmentation process. The Canny filter, applied to Sentinel-2 multi-temporal data, provides refined input for training ResUnet models, facilitating the generation of a generalized training dataset. ResUnet allows the model to learn complex features from diverse data, encapsulating seasonal changes. The dataset was specifically designed to enable the model to make accurate predictions from a single image, significantly outperforming traditional Canny filter predictions. In addition, the ResUnet may be applied to multiple images, generating output masks that, when overlayed, produce better results with respect to the multi-temporal Canny approach, demonstrating superior ability in recognizing real field boundaries while reducing false detections.To enhance generalizability, ResUnet is trained on a varied global dataset capturing a wide range of agricultural conditions and seasonal variations. This generalized model is tested across different regions and seasons, and preliminary results indicate that the proposed approach offers operational efficiency and accuracy in automating crop field segmentation.","2153-7003","979-8-3503-6032-5","10.1109/IGARSS53475.2024.10641103","European Space Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10641103","U-Net;ResUNet;Crop-field Segmentation;deep-learning;canny edge detection;watershed;Sentinel-2;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)","Training;Image segmentation;Adaptation models;Accuracy;Image edge detection;Crops;Predictive models","","1","","11","IEEE","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Precise fertilisation can help to balance soil nutrients, conserve fertiliser, prevent pollution, and boost crop yields. The lack of agricultural data is a key reason limiting the application of machine learning methods in agriculture. Due to the low-level network technology in farms, it is difficult to obtain diverse and complete agricultural data. The existing agricultural data is typically unstructured and difficult to mine. In this article, we extracted real-world agricultural dataset from four real farms with winter wheat and it includes different types of factors describing agriculture, such as climate, soil nutrients, crop yield information. Moreover, we present a novel multi-task learning (MTL) approach based on a tensor built of farm data to efficiently prediction both the amount and time of base fertiliser and topdressing. Specifically, real-world agricultural measurements (such as climate data, soil nutrients, etc.) are encoded into a three-dimensional tensor, and a set of interpretable temporal and spatial latent factors is extracted from the raw data through tensor decomposition. The latent factors are then utilised to train the spatio-temporal tensor prediction model. We have conducted extensive experiments utilising the real-world agricultural dataset.

In many cases, a DSS that is exclusively focused on data-driven methodologies might be highly influenced by data sources if these data resources do not provide any sense of intended conclusion. As a result, on-farm experiment inputs may result in incorrect site-specific crop management in the end. Since data is an essential element of DSS, irregular patterns such as outliers in spatial data that can change the nature of expected outcomes must be avoided during data-driven manipulations. Many of the approaches developed to detect outliers were not designed to deal with masking and swamping effects. With this consideration, the work presented here uses two iterative techniques to locate and remove spatial outliers based on their neighbourhood relationship. As a result of this technique, the masking and swamping effects are reduced. The methods we use are iterative, implying that each iteration discovers and eliminates the expected number of outlying observations. R-Studio is used to demonstrate the use of iterative approaches. The efficacy of both iterative procedures was analysed and compared using one of the current graphical approaches, such as the semivariogram.

Through the various kinds of imageries of agricultural fields, people can conclude the status of the fields and figure out what kind of crops are suitable and how to cultivate and irrigate the fields.

Particularly, OGC WCS standard and SOAP protocol are adopted to realize this capability. WCS is used to provide an interoperable interface for endpoint users to manipulate certain raster datasets in the form of coverages. SOAP provides a XML-based, lightweight and end-to-end information exchange protocol in distributed environment. A combination of WCS and SOAP ensures the remote sensing imageries can be easily and securely delivered from server to endpoint users. The operations in WCS also support endpoint users to simply process the coverages on the client side. We implemented a WCS with SOAP proxy on a public server and experimented the service with the LandSat dataset, USGS Global SRTM dataset, global VCI dataset and U.S. CDL.

As smartphones are widely available among farmers across the globe, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) for agricultural data collection becomes a cost-effective and efficient solution by integrating participatory sensing based on a large group of individuals. This article proposes an MCS-enabled framework to address the SIL maintenance problem (SILMP) and perform system analysis by considering both the partition structure of farmland and the insecticidal efficiency of SILs. In addition, considering the farmland’s practical natural geographical features, we propose dividing the regions of interest into numerous subareas, where each subarea can be considered a separate partition. Finally, we formulate the SILMP framework as two subproblems, i.e., path planning and task selection, and propose two different methods to tackle each problem based on the concept of greedy algorithm.

As lacking the labeled data to train an in-situ segmentation model for on-branch soybean pods, we propose a transfer learning from synthetic in-vitro soybean pods. First, we present a novel automated image generation method to rapidly generate a synthetic in-vitro soybean pods dataset with plenty of annotated samples. The in-vitro soybean pods samples are overlapped to simulate the frequently physically touching of on-branch soybean pods. Then, we design a two-step transfer learning. In the first step, we finetune an instance segmentation network pretrained by a source domain (MS COCO dataset) with a synthetic target domain (in-vitro soybean pods dataset). In the second step, transferring from simulation to reality is performed by finetuning on a few real-world mature soybean plant samples. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed two-step transfer learning method, such that AP50 was 0.80 for the real-world mature soybean plant test dataset, which is higher than that of direct adaptation and its AP50 was 0.77.

Advances in field management through robotic intervention, monitoring of crops by autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) supporting breeding of novel and more resilient crop varieties can help to address these challenges. The analysis of plant traits is called phenotyping and is an essential activity in plant breeding; it however involves a great amount of manual labor. With this paper, we provide means to better tackle the problems of instance segmentation to support robotic intervention and automatic fine-grained, organ-level geometric analysis needed for precision phenotyping. As the availability of real-world data in this domain is relatively scarce, we provide a novel dataset that was acquired using UAVs capturing high-resolution images of real breeding trials containing 48 plant varieties and therefore covering a relevant morphological and appearance spectrum. This enables the development of approaches for instance segmentation and autonomous phenotyping that generalize well to different plant varieties. Based on overlapping high-resolution images taken from multiple viewing angles, we provide photogrammetric dense point clouds and provide detailed and accurate point-wise labels for plants, leaves, and salient points as the tip and the base in 3D. Additionally, we include measurements of phenotypic traits performed by experts from the German Federal Plant Variety Office on the real plants, allowing the evaluation of new approaches not only on segmentation and keypoint detection but also directly on actual traits.

Existing global bioclimatic datasets often exhibit kilometer-level coarse resolution or have miss the data in recent decades, potentially resulting in the issues of lower spatial accuracy, limited information, and restricted applicability in fine-scaled studies. Hubei Province in Yangtze River Middle Reaches has sparse meteorological stations in high-altitude mountainous areas to map the high-resolution bioclimatic variables directly. This study developed a 30-year averaged bioclimatic dataset for Hubei Province during 1991–2020 at a 30-m spatial resolution, utilizing monthly temperatures and precipitation derived from a downscaling-calibration framework. The downscaling of 1-km resolution climate variables was achieved by using a random forest model with 30-m resolution terrain and spatial covariates. Then, the geographical differential analysis was applied to improve the accuracy of downscaled products by including additional ground data. The mean absolute errors of calibrated monthly maximum, mean, minimum temperatures, and precipitation based on ordinary kriging decreased from 0.74 °C, 0.47 °C, 0.47 °C, and 28.27 mm to 0.43 °C, 0.28 °C, 0.36 °C, and 21.43 mm, respectively. Finally, calibrated climate variables were employed to calculate 19 annual bioclimatic variables, which were subsequently averaged over the 30-year period. The constructed bioclimatic dataset exhibits high overall consistency with the WorldClim dataset according to pixel-based comparison (Spearman correlation coefficients >0.6), with differences mainly attributed to the superior local accuracy of our dataset and climate changes.

The ResNet9 model is trained on a diverse dataset of plant images, including both healthy and diseased plants, representing different plant species and diseases. Our method leverages the power of deep learning to automatically learn discriminative features from plant images, enabling it to distinguish between healthy and diseased plants with a high degree of accuracy. We evaluate the performance of our model on a real-world dataset of plant images, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in disease detection. The model achieves a high accuracy rate, indicating its potential for field deployment to assist farmers in monitoring and managing plant health. In conclusion, our study presents a promising solution for automated plant disease detection, providing farmers and agronomists with a practical tool to identify and combat plant diseases early, ultimately contributing to improving crop productivity and food security.","","979-8-3503-6052-3","10.1109/IATMSI60426.2024.10502662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10502662","Convolutional Neural Network;Image preprocessing;ResNet;Transfer Learning;Deep Learning","Training;Productivity;Deep learning;Plant diseases;Technological innovation;Food security;Transforms","","","","15","IEEE","24 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the major challenges is the breakout of plant diseases that harm the crop in the field. To address this issue, several artificial intelligence and Internet of Things-based systems have been developed for crop monitoring and containment of plant diseases at early stages. In this article, a real-time plant disease identification system is designed using drone-based surveillance and farmer's input. A lightweight plant disease classification model is deployed in the proposed system using a fusion of a vision transformer and a convolutional neural network. The proposed model deploys conditional attention with a statistical squeeze-and-excitation module to efficiently learn the plant disease patterns from images captured under normal and challenging weather conditions. With only 0.95 million trainable parameters, the performance of the proposed plant disease classification model surpasses that of seven state-of-the-art techniques on five public datasets and an in-house developed maize dataset from drone camera-captured images under varying environmental conditions. To provide a better learning experience of real-world data to the model, a generative adversarial network, C3GAN, inspired by cycleGAN, is proposed for data augmentation of the collected maize dataset. The system keeps updating the model parameters based on the feedback of agriculture experts and farmers when new diseases break out or the model's performance deteriorates on unseen data during the surveillance over a period of time.","2771-9529","","10.1109/TAFE.2024.3447792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10680721","Conditional convolution (CondConv);generative adversarial network (GAN);maize dataset;real-time plant disease classification;vision transformer (ViT)","Climate change;Generative adversarial networks;Real-time systems;Plant diseases;Classification algorithms;Convolutional neural networks","","3","","42","IEEE","16 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Loss of trees caused by the Emerald Ash Borer pest had a significant public health impact due to an increase in mortality related to cardiovascular and respiratory-tract illness [2]. Outbreaks of UG99 wheat rust strain can cause up to 100% crop losses of wheat and is viewed as a potential worldwide disaster with massive implications for global food security [6]. In Canada, an outbreak of Potato Wart disease in 2000 resulted in $280 million in costs to the provincial economy of Prince Edward Island [1]. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has completed decades of risk analyses for various crop commodities and specific pests/pathogens. These analyses characterize the risk of exotic pests to Canada and support regulatory decision-making and response actions. This information is currently stored and maintained in a myriad of disconnected databases, spreadsheets, and technical documents under the control of the Plant Health Risk Assessment Unit. This private corpus represents a unique source of invaluable analyses tailored to the Canadian context, which are not found anywhere else in the world. Additional risk information for other countries is drawn from the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO)1 global database of country regulated pests and the U.S. Department of AgricultureâĂŹs (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regulated plant pest list2. The cost of next generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA has decreased exponentially[10]. As a consequence, academic institutions are aggressively staffing positions in environmental metagenomics, and while these researchers may not be specifically looking for plant pests or pathogens, or even human pathogens, large volumes of data with a wide range of species names will be automatically generated and be made publicly available and searchable on the web. The generation of large amount of DNA sequence data from Canadian samples creates exciting opportunities. At the same time, there is an inherent risk to trade should a quarantine organism in a Canadian sample be detected that is not currently known to exist in Canada. Interpretation or misinterpretation of species identification from such studies at their face value could potentially trigger trade issues. The study seeks to evaluate the benefits and means to actively link quantitative Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) sample data with qualitative risk assessment information. This will guide policy and operational decision-making for rapid detection, surveillance and response against plant health threats and to set a new scientific standard for knowledge-based international trade actions for the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries. One of the goals of this study is to evaluate the use of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to extract pest risk information from the CFIA risk corpus. This study is limited to fungi that are pathogens, partially to limit its initial scope. The fungi are taxonomic group that arguably have some of the most complex taxonomic naming problems due to (among other things) the anamorph-teleomorph-holomorph[8] issue3. Collecting the fungal names synonyms is needed to canonicalize the fungal names found both in the risks sources and the NGS identification results. Previous work on risk has not looked at risk such as in this study which examines the risk of pathogenic species on the trade and agriculture. This previous work has looked at the broader topic of event extraction for decision support[3], corporate risk[4]. More recent work has examined risk in a more granular fashion, such as supplier selection[7] and more specifically, assessing the likelihood (risk) of child labour by suppliers[9], . The poster will provide early results of this stage of the project, primarily the risk extraction from the CFIA (Canadian) corpus, the risk and organism names for other countries from the EPPO and the USDA, and the collection and rationalization of the fungal synonym naming from Mycobank and Index Fungorum.","","978-1-7281-1547-4","10.1109/JCDL.2019.00074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8791223","text analysis;risk;fungi;next generation sequencing;test mining","Risk management;Agriculture;Data mining;Inspection;Plants (biology);Pathogens","","1","","10","Crown","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

L.) is one of the vital broad-leaved weeds in grassland that needs removal. It affects dairy products and reduces their quality. Hand-removal methods are costly and time-consuming. Chemical treatment using herbicides has a negative impact on crops and causes environmental pollution. In smart farming, weeding is performed by using computer vision to recognize the weeds efficiently and effectively. Conventional machine learning (ML)-based algorithms face challenges, especially in identifying the weeds in real-world data due to a lack of features. Deep learning (DL) approaches use self-learning to extract all potential features that assist in classifying malignant weed species accurately. Recently, single deep learning methods achieved high performance in identifying well-separated and illumination but suffered from misclassification in more sophisticated cases such as overlapping and partial occlusion leaves. This paper presents a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model of three state-of-the-art CNNs to classify Rumex obtusifolius. The proposed model utilizes convolutional neural networks to extract features and classify images. The framework of the proposed method comprises three paramount stages to accomplish the classification key idea, including the data preparation phase, pre-processing phase, and classification phase. A hybrid model of three CNN extractor networks is used as the backbone in the classification stage. Our tested data is real-world data that includes multi-circumstances (overlap, occlusion, various illuminations, etc.) acquired from nature. The first extractor is the Visual Graphics Group-16 (VGG-16) for well-separated leaves and non-complicated issues. The second extractor is Residential Energy Services Network-50 (ResNet-50), to overcome complex real-world issues. The third extractor is Inception-v3 to solve the illumination problem. Therefore, combining three networks into one model improves the discriminatory ability to extract additional useful features. The proposed model has been tested using two benchmark datasets for Rumex weed plants. Both of these datasets were captured in real-world environments. The first dataset consists of 900 samples, while the second dataset consists of 677 samples. Each dataset is individually tested in the proposed model to evaluate the classification accuracy using a set of standard evaluation metrics including accuracy, precession, recall, True-Positive Rate (TPR), False-Positive Rate (FPR), and F1-score. The total averages of the proposed model on both datasets are 97.51%, 97.4%, 94.45%, and 95.9% on the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3200603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9864151","CNN networks;ensemble models;real-world data;weed classification;economic growth","Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Lighting;Computational modeling;Crops;Chemicals;Visualization;Economics;Agriculture;Classification algorithms ","","18","","58","CCBY","22 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Robots have the potential to treat every plant in the field individually and thus can reduce the required use of such chemicals. To achieve that, robots need the ability to identify crops and weeds in the field and must additionally select effective treatments. While certain types of weed can be treated mechanically, other types need to be treated by (selective) spraying. In this paper, we present an approach that provides the necessary information for effective plant-specific treatment. It outputs the stem location for weeds, which allows for mechanical treatments, and the covered area of the weed for selective spraying. Our approach uses an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates stem positions as well as the covered area of crops and weeds. It jointly learns the class-wise stem detection and the pixel-wise semantic segmentation. Experimental evaluations on different real-world datasets show that our approach is able to reliably solve this problem.

Its healthy cultivation not only concerns national food security but also profoundly affects the regulation and trade patterns of international food resources. To assess wheat planting density and predict yields, this study designs a lightweight wheat detection network based on NanoDet. The network encoding process incorporates Ghost convolution, which introduces more feature maps during the convolution process using fewer parameters and computing resources, thereby enhancing the network's computational efficiency and operational speed. Additionally, a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is employed to optimize the information transfer and fusion between feature layers, enhancing the model's capability to process multi-scale features, and further improving performance and efficiency. Experiments conducted on the public Global Wheat Head Dataset (GWHD) show that the model improves detection accuracy and speed without significantly increasing the size of the weight model file. The average detection precision of wheat heads reached 84.3%, with a detection speed of up to 14.3ms per frame, and the weight model file size is approximately 4.3MB. This rapid inference speed and minimal model size provide significant support for embedded devices, offering robust backing for the field application of intelligent agriculture.","","979-8-3315-1709-0","10.1109/ACAIT63902.2024.11021827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11021827","NanoDet;lightweight;wheat ear detection;intelligent agriculture","Smart agriculture;Visualization;Accuracy;Convolution;Computational modeling;Food security;Ear;Regulation;Nanoscale devices;Computational efficiency","","","","15","IEEE","10 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These smart devices range from typical home appliances to sophisticated industrial instruments. IoT has numerous applications, such as precision farming, health care, and smart cities. An issue that is prevalent in IoT networks is that due to limited resources, environmental factors, and malicious attacks, some nodes or links fail and adversely affect the functioning of IoT networks. Hence, robustness against the failure of nodes or links is a topic of considerable interest in the area of IoT networks. The robustness of a network is quantified using various spectral graph theoretic measures in network science. One such measure is network criticality which effectively quantifies the robustness against the failure of nodes or communication links. However, this measure can not be used to study the effect of different network parameters for large-scale IoT networks due to huge computational complexity of  $O(n^{3})$ . In this work, we derive the explicit formulas of network criticality for IoT networks using  $r$ -nearest neighbor graphs and show the effect of nearest neighbors and network size on robustness. Our theoretical expressions substantially reduce the computational complexity as compared to existing graph theory-based metrics. We observe that network robustness decreases with the network size and exponentially increases with nearest neighbors. Our work reduces the time complexity of network criticality evaluation from  $O(n^{3})$  to  $O(n)$  for static topologies and to  $O(1)$  for switching topologies. Furthermore, we extend our study to random geometric graphs (RGGs) and real-world network data sets.

Hence, in the era of post-pandemic awareness towards staple crop security, one of the most challenging problems studied in computer vision for agriculture is the wheat head counting in field conditions with spike and spikelet occlusions and overlaps. The final target is to offer a solid key informational input between many necessary others, to make farmers, breeders and agronomists able to estimate the wheat head density and supervise their emergence and growth over time and space allowing them to interact on time in the process and to have an idea about yield estimations.

It is challenging to estimate the average causal effect and individual causal effects from observational data with high-dimensional covariates due to the curse of dimension and the problem of data sufficiency. The existing matching methods can not effectively estimate individual causal effect or solve the problem of dimension curse in causal inference. To address this challenge, in this work, we prove that the reduced set by sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is a balance score for confounding adjustment. Under the theorem, we propose to use an SDR method to obtain a reduced representation set of the original covariates and then the reduced set is used for the matching method. In detail, a non-parametric model is used to learn such a reduced set and to avoid model specification errors. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the compared matching methods. Moreover, we conduct an experiment analysis and the results demonstrate that the reduced representation is enough to balance the imbalance between the treatment group and control group individuals.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00036","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076041,61806027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074882","Matching;Sufficient Dimension Reduction;Causal Inference;Individual Causal Effect","Dimensionality reduction;Smart cities;Estimation","","1","","43","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A Random Forest Classifier examines pixels with similar characteristics in a pool of unlabeled data, and gully objects are detected where high densities of gully pixels are enclosed by an alpha shape. Gully objects are used in subsequent iterations following a mechanism where the algorithm uses the most reliable pixels as gully training samples. The gully class continuously grows until an optimal scenario in terms of accuracy is achieved. Results are benchmarked with manually tagged gullies (initial gully labeled area <; 0.3% of the total study area) in two different watersheds (408 and 302 km2, respectively) yielding total accuracies of >98%, with 60% in the gully class, Cohen Kappa >0.5, Matthews Correlation Coefficient >0.5, and receiver operating characteristic Area Under the Curve >0.89.

Constructing a directed acyclic graph composed of regression models is an attractive approach for such analysis; however, the relationships can possibly be nonlinear, so the direct application of existing analytic approaches will not be appropriate. In this paper, we propose a methodology for relationship analysis among variables based on the directed acyclic graphs while identifying the linearity/nonlinearity in their relationships. In general, the construction of such a graphical model has computational issues, especially when the number of variables is large, and the risk of overfitting. The proposed method utilizes the idea of sparse regularization, which has been actively discussed in the field of machine learning, for realizing the automatic identification of linearity/nonlinearity between variables and screening redundant candidate structures; this approach relaxes the computational complexity issue and controls the risk of overfitting. As a case study, the proposed method is applied to a dataset collected from a real-world cultivation system in a plant factory to discuss its usefulness.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2903830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663284","Analysis of plant data;directed graphical model;energy-aware plant growth control;identification of linearity/nonlinearity;overlap group lasso;plant factory;sparse partially linear model","Production facilities;Analytical models;Graphical models;Additives;Agriculture;Mathematical model;Machine learning","","15","","52","OAPA","8 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise their performance, integrity, and privacy. This research focuses on defending crop recommendation systems against poisoning and evasion attacks, which aim to manipulate the training data and deceive the model during prediction, respectively. The research investigates the vulnerabilities of crop recommendation systems to adversarial attacks and analyzes potential risks and consequences. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed defenses, extensive experiments are conducted using a real-world dataset of crop information. The results demonstrate the susceptibility of crop recommendation systems to adversarial attacks. Specifically, the accuracy of the model decreases to 0.64 and 0.65 under poisoned attacks, while the precision drops to 0.77 and 0.65. However, after implementing the defense mechanisms, the model's accuracy and precision improve to 0.73 and 0.75, respectively. Additionally, under evasion attacks, the model's recall decreases to 0.48 and the F1-score drops to 0.70. Nevertheless, the defense mechanisms significantly improve the model's recall to 0.86 and the F1-score to 0.80.

In general, the approach relies on a change detection analysis applied on pre- and post-event images [1]. This change detection analysis is usually carried out by comparing the values of specific spectral indices such as: NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) [2], BAI (Burned Area Index) [3], MIRBI (Mid Infrared Burn Index) [4]. However, some potential sources of error arise, in particular when near-real-time automated approaches are adopted. An automated approach is needed when the burnt area monitoring should operate systematically on a given area of large sizes (country). Potential sources of error are: clouds on the pre- or post-event images, clouds or topographic shadows [5], agricultural practices, image pixel size, level of damage, etc. [6]Sources of difference between different existing global datasets of burned areas based on satellite images could be related to the spatial resolution of the images used, the land cover mask adopted to avoid false alarms, the quality of the cloud and shadow masks. This paper aims at comparing several burned area databases (EFFIS, ESACCI, Copernicus, FIRMS, etc.) with the objective of identifying and characterizing their approximations. In order to do so, ground survey data provided by CUFA (Comando unità forestali, ambientali e agroalimentari Carabinieri) and CFVA (Corpo Forestale e Vigilanza Ambientale Sardegna) have been used. In using ground data, the accessibility of the burned area has been also considered in order to account for the approximations due to the difficulties in reaching the affected area.","2153-7003","979-8-3503-2010-7","10.1109/IGARSS52108.2023.10281540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10281540","wildfires;burnt areas;satellite images;datasets;FirEUrisk","Surveys;Satellites;Vegetation mapping;Forestry;Satellite images;Indexes;Object recognition","","","","14","IEEE","20 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies (e.g., SVANN, spatial ensemble) targeting this difficult problem either require a known space-partitioning as the input, or can only support very limited number of partitions or classes (e.g., two) due to the decrease in training data size and the complexity of analysis. To address these limitations, we propose a model-agnostic framework to automatically transform a deep learning model into a spatial-heterogeneity-aware architecture, where the learning of arbitrary space partitionings is guided by a learning-engaged generalization of multivariate scan statistic and parameters are shared based on spatial relationships. We also propose a spatial moderator to generalize learned space partitionings to new test regions. Experiment results on real-world datasets show that the spatial transformation and moderation framework can effectively capture flexibly-shaped heterogeneous footprints and substantially improve prediction performances.","2374-8486","978-1-6654-2398-4","10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679027","Deep learning;statistics;spatial heterogeneity","Deep learning;COVID-19;Satellites;Pandemics;Transportation;Training data;Process control","","16","","27","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current methods face significant challenges that hinder their effectiveness. Many existing models require high volumes of data, which can be difficult to obtain and manage, leading to inefficiencies in real-world applications. Additionally, these methods often struggle with inaccurate counting, primarily due to issues such as overlapping wheat ears, occlusion, and varying environmental conditions that complicate image analysis. To address these challenges, this paper presents a wheat counting method based on LC-DeepLab. By integrating the lightweight MobileNet V2 as the backbone, the approach enhances data processing speed and recognition accuracy. The model improves feature extraction through concatenated atrous convolutional layers in the pooled pyramid module. A localization-based counting loss function (LC) is also utilized to further optimize accuracy, ensuring more reliable identification of wheat ears even in complex scenarios. Experimental results on the Global Wheat dataset demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving a precision of 92.20%, recall of 92.56%, and mean average precision (mAP) of 90.89%. The proposed method outperforms benchmark models, increasing precision, recall, and mAP by 2.21, 1.74, and 1.93 percentage points, respectively, while meeting real-time detection needs. The LC-DeepLab model exhibits superior robustness in handling complex situations, such as occlusion and overlap, underscoring its potential application in intelligent agriculture.","","979-8-3315-0799-2","10.1109/ICCEIC64099.2024.10775702","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10775702","component;Ear-Count;ASPP;DeepLab;Lightweight;Target detection","Location awareness;Solid modeling;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Ear;Feature extraction;Data processing;Data models;Robustness;Real-time systems","","","","11","IEEE","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each client's data is unique for constructing a valid model that accounts for the wide range of environmental factors and illness presentations. The core component of our methodology is federated learning, which ensures data privacy while reducing the need for centralized storage and allowing a CNN model to be trained cooperatively by multiple clients. The model's performance is measured using accuracy, precision-recall, F1-score, and support metrics. The results analysis reveals that the approach works for all four customers. However, the macroaverage scores consistently demonstrated a capacity to diagnose various levels of severity between 90.35% and 87% for all classes.

On the same note, microaverages that work well for class-imbalanced datasets revealed outstanding ranges between 90.41% and 94.83%. These results show that the model's performance remains accurate for various class frequencies and distributions. Additionally, federated averaging was critical for transforming the local data analysis into a unified global model. This can be seen in converting local data to global data, where federated averaging enabled combining numerous learnings from different locations into a comprehensive picture of the sunflower leaf disease level worldwide.

Deep learning-based methods have demonstrated to be effective in super-resolution (SR) techniques, which reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) images. However, existing deep learning methods have not fully considered the multiscale spatial heterogeneity and topographic knowledge of DEM data that differentiate them from traditional images. These defects inevitably lead to the localized smoothing of the reconstructed DEM and influence the reliability of downstream geographical analysis. This study proposes a transformer-based topography neural network (TTSR) for DEM SR incorporating a local-global deformable block (LGDB) for capturing the multiscale spatial heterogeneity and topographic knowledge, a spatio-channel coupled channel attention (SimAM) mechanism for reallocating channel weights and providing a supplement of the global spatial features, and an improved terrain loss function (iLoss) for mitigating noise across datasets. TTSR was validated using two publicly available real-world DEM datasets for recovering DEM from 30 to 10 m. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed method was reduced by approximately 6%–30%, 4%–16%, and 1%–9% in elevation accuracy, slope accuracy, and aspect accuracy, respectively, compared to the best one of those state-of-the-art methods.

The synthetic dataset, rendered from perspectives consistent with a robotic harvester's camera in the Gazebo physics engine, provides a comprehensive range of scenarios for robust model training. For validation, we deploy U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network, emphasizing its adaptability to domain shifts between synthetic and real-world data. By integrating strategies such as domain adaptation, data augmentation, and the inclusion of pre-trained ResNet-50 encoders in the U-Net framework, we demonstrate superior performance in detecting and segmenting apples in diverse real-world conditions compared to standard U-Net models and traditional computer vision techniques. The results highlight the potential of synthetic data in deep learning-based semantic segmentation, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution when real-world data is limited or hard to collect.","","979-8-3503-6107-0","10.1109/UR61395.2024.10597519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10597519","","Training;Adaptation models;Three-dimensional displays;Semantic segmentation;Robot vision systems;Lighting;Standards","","1","","24","IEEE","26 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, building and updating a common map of the field is an essential but challenging task. The maps built using robots of different types show differences in size, resolution, and scale, the associated geolocation data may be inaccurate and biased while the repetitiveness of both visual appearance and geometric structures found within agricultural contexts render classical map merging techniques ineffective. In this letter, we propose AgriColMap, a novel map registration pipeline that leverages a grid-based multimodal environment representation, which includes a vegetation index map and a digital surface model. We cast the data association problem between maps built from UAVs and UGVs as a multimodal, large displacement dense optical flow estimation. The dominant, coherent flows, selected using a voting scheme, are used as point-to-point correspondences to infer a preliminary nonrigid alignment between the maps. A final refinement is then performed, by exploiting only meaningful parts of the registered maps. We evaluate our system using real-world data for three fields with different crop species. The results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art map registration and matching techniques by a large margin, and has a higher tolerance to large initial misalignments.

This study describes a novel method for identifying six kinds of fenugreek leaf diseases using federated learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across several client datasets and bypassing the need for raw data exchange to retain the Federated Learning principle of privacy preservation while ensuring accurate illness categorization. Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy were the four main metrics to assess the model's robustness. The model consistently performed well in individual client evaluations (part IV), with F1-scores for all classes reaching 88% in Client A, 92% in Client B, 93% in Client C, and 95% in Client D. On the globally aggregated dataset (part V), the model continued to perform well, with overall F1-scores of 91.78% for Client A, 95.67% for Client B, 93.52% for Client C, and 94.93% for Client D. Three averaging techniques—macro average, weighted average, and micro average—were used for a deeper analysis in Section VI.

Software-defined networking (SDN) emerges as a solution to this dilemma, offering enhanced flexibility and scalability. However, the security vulnerabilities inherent in SDN-based Internet of Things (IoT) networks, particularly in critical sectors like agriculture, present significant concerns. During a drought, critical infrastructures, such as water distribution systems in agricultural environments, could be targeted by DDoS attacks, further exacerbating the crisis. Additionally, these attacks could serve as distractions, diverting the focus of authorities and farmers away from necessary measures to manage the drought. Moreover, IoT devices used for monitoring meteorological conditions during the drought could also be compromised and exploited in DDoS attacks. To address this vulnerability, a proposed mechanism combines machine learning (ML) with SDN to detect and mitigate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in agricultural environments. This approach operates in three phases: building a robust detection model using ML techniques, integrating this model into the SDN controller for real-time anomaly detection, and implementing mitigation strategies to prevent further damage in case of an attack. Performance evaluation using accuracy performance metrics has demonstrated remarkable results, achieving 99.97% accuracy in detecting DDoS attacks with real-world datasets. This innovative approach not only enhances the security of agricultural networks but also ensures the uninterrupted operation of critical surveillance systems, thereby safeguarding food production and supply chains.","2643-6868","979-8-3503-6792-8","10.1109/ICT-DM62768.2024.10798927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10798927","Internet of Things (IoT);Software-defined networking (SDN);Distributed denial of service (DDoS);Machine learning (ML);Smart agriculture","Technological innovation;Accuracy;Surveillance;Droughts;Supply chains;Machine learning;Denial-of-service attack;Agriculture;Internet of Things;Security","","","","24","IEEE","18 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, to date, little is known about the actual performance of standalone UWB positioning in these environments. In this article, a detailed performance analysis of a standalone UWB positioning system in a GNSS-denied forest environment with slight and serious non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagations was performed. Positioning accuracy and the effect of the positioning update rate on the accuracy, as well as the time consumption for different positioning methods, were analyzed based on real-world datasets. The results show that the standalone UWB positioning system is able to achieve decimeter-level positioning accuracy that is better than 0.3 m in the OXY plane inside the forest canopy even in the presence of severe NLOS propagations.

Previous studies have investigated the influence of weather parameters on LoraWAN signal strength and path loss. Nevertheless, there is a lack of analysis on online weather parameter learning at the LoRaWAN edge and choosing the RF channel appropriately for improving the SNR. This research attempts to enable the online learning of weather conditions at the edge and facilitate the usage of suitable RF channels. Such a process pre-emptively avoids signal degradation and improves the SNR. This is achieved by employing a multi-criteria channel bandit (MCCB) algorithm at the LoraWAN edge. The MCCB adjusts the selection of RF channels based on real-time weather parameters. We evaluate the effectiveness of three MCCB variants: MCCB-Greedy, MCCB-Bayesian, and MCCB-Exponential.

The proposed framework (ANFIS-FFA), combines the specific structures and strengths of both ANFIS and FFA approaches. The FFA is used to derive the optimum ANFIS parameters. The  $K_{x}$  data set includes 503 cross-sectional data point from small to large rivers. For pre-processing of the data set, the SSMD method is used, which is superior to the classical trial and error method. The database covers a wide range of river width (0.2- 867m), and depths (0.034- 19.9 m). Fifteen different combinations of river width (B), depth (H), flow velocity (U) and shear velocity ( $\text{U}_{\ast }$ ) are implemented as inputs to create fifteen estimative models. The output of the ANFIS-FFA model is compared with the ANFIS and previously published equations to check the performance of the proposed model. The results show that the highest accuracy is attained by the M1 model, with all geometric and hydrodynamic parameters as input variables in comparison with ANFIS and previous equations.

However, existing scene text detectors may overfit on the public datasets due to the limited training data, or generate inaccurate localization for arbitrary-shape scene texts. This paper presents an arbitrary-shape scene text detection method that can achieve better generalization ability and more accurate localization. We first propose a Scale-Aware Data Augmentation (SADA) technique to increase the diversity of training samples. SADA considers the scale variations and local visual variations of scene texts, which can effectively relieve the dilemma of limited training data. At the same time, SADA can enrich the training minibatch, which contributes to accelerating the training process. Furthermore, a Shape Similarity Constraint (SSC) technique is exploited to model the global shape structure of arbitrary-shape scene texts and backgrounds from the perspective of the loss function. SSC encourages the segmentation of text or non-text in the candidate boxes to be similar to the corresponding ground truth, which is helpful to localize more accurate boundaries for arbitrary-shape scene texts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, and state-of-the-art performances are achieved over public arbitrary-shape scene text benchmarks (e.g., CTW1500, Total-Text and ArT).","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2021.3073575","National Key R and D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1406704); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62025604,61733007,62072454,U1936208,U1736219); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:QYZDB-SSW-JSC003); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4202084); Peng Cheng Laboratory Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:PCL2018KP004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405411","Scene text detection;arbitrary shape;text part;global context;data augmentation;accurate localization","Training;Shape;Image segmentation;Agriculture;Proposals;Location awareness;Training data","","35","","64","IEEE","15 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A robust model that can provide rich semantic information is imperative for the challenging task of land cover classification (LCC) in foggy conditions.

The dense depthwise separable atrous spatial pyramid pooling (DDS-ASPP) module in SRE possesses a large receptive field, which covers an extensive scale range. An enhanced asymmetric convolution module (EACM) in SRE focuses on features of various directions. DDS-ASPP and EACM generate the class-based and pixel-based representation, respectively.

However, it is challenging to register images across different data-collection days, especially across seasons, due to the self-occluding geometry and temporal dynamics in forests and orchards. This paper proposes a new approach for registering under-canopy image sequences in general and in these situations. Our methodology leverages standard GPS data and deep-learning-based perspective to bird’s-eye view conversion to provide an initial estimation of the positions of the trees in images and their association across datasets. Furthermore, it introduces an innovative strategy for extracting tree trunks and clean ground surfaces from noisy and sparse 3D reconstructions created from the image sequences, utilizing these features to achieve precise alignment. Our robust alignment method effectively mitigates position and scale drift, which may arise from GPS inaccuracies and Sparse Structure from Motion (SfM) limitations. We evaluate our approach on three challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating that our method outperforms ICP-based methods on average by 50%, and surpasses FGR and TEASER++ by over 90% in alignment accuracy.

By applying a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique to a large set of natural spectra, we show that the spectra of natural scenes lie on an intrinsically low dimensional manifold.

Therefore, over the last years, several methods based on computer vision were proposed to automate this task, by directly counting the fruits on trees using a video camera. However, existing works and methods usually assume ideal conditions, and may fail under more challenging scenarios with unconstrained camera motion and intermittent occlusions of fruits. Here we show that combining Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with a bipartite graph matching has the potential to address those challenges. We found that our approach applied to real-world datasets, with unconstrained camera motion and low frame rates, outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to multiple intermittent occlusions under challenging conditions, and thus suitable to be used in diverse real-world scenarios in orchards, either with a camera operated by hand or mounted on an agricultural vehicle. Although not shown here, we believe that the proposed method can also be applied to other object tracking problems besides counting fruits, under similar settings — i.e. static objects and a freely moving camera.","2160-7516","979-8-3503-6547-4","10.1109/CVPRW63382.2024.00550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10677958","precision agriculture;yield estimation;fruit counting;intermittent occlusions;multi-object tracking","Computer vision;Visualization;Conferences;Crops;Cameras;Trajectory;Pattern recognition","","2","","29","IEEE","27 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to information inaccuracy, individual non-response and dropout, and sampling biases in observations, the evolving noisy social network that coexists true edges and spurious edges is pervasive in actual applications, where the ignoration of credibility otherness of observed edges could lead to the wrong estimates of social properties and misleading conclusions. To discover credible edge information to shape correct social interactions among individuals, we propose a universal and explainable multiple-neighbor evolutional filtering method (MEFM) to evaluate how credible of observed edges to ‘truly’ exist in the evolving noisy social network. MEFM consists of an evolutional extractor and a filtering evaluator. To resist the noisy disturbance, the evolutional extractor exploits the evolutional states of edges from the perspective of evolution mechanisms within multiple-neighbor ranges, which applies different link prediction algorithms to fit the evolution mechanism in the formation of each edge. Further, the filtering evaluator reconstructs Kalman filter to predict and refine the evolutional states of edges based on their evolving local structures. As a result, MEFM combines the evolutional extractor and the filtering evaluator to analyze the evolutional fluctuations of the observed edges to evaluate their credibility. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed MEFM can effectively and reasonably evaluate edge credibility in evolving noisy social networks.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2022.3223403","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62006089); National Key D&R Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1600704); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR(grant numbers:0068/2020/AGJ,0045/2019/ A1,SKL-IOTSC(UM)-2021-2023); GDST(grant numbers:2020B1212030003); CCF-Huawei Populus Grove Fund(grant numbers:CCF-HuaweiLK2022004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62202109); Open Foundation of Henan Key Laboratory of Cyberspace Situation Awareness(grant numbers:Q1 HNTS2022032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9956847","Evolving noisy social network;Kalman filter;edge credibility;link prediction","Noise measurement;Social networking (online);Kalman filters;Prediction algorithms;Filtering;Resists;Smart cities","","4","","43","IEEE","21 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a reaction, the study utilizes the emerging capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and federated learning to provide a distinct, decentralized, and all-encompassing diagnostic method. Using five different classes of Papaya leaf diseases, the technique examined and analyzed each local data repository independently for each of the five customers (cy_1 through cy_5). After extensive training and validation, several statistical discoveries were made. The precision values obtained from the local data result analysis were as follows: 80.32% for cy_1-fe_1 and a staggering 90.37% for cy_5-fe_5. The accuracy, recall, F1-score, support, and accuracy values further validated the robustness and flexibility of the federated CNN model. Extending an integrative perspective, the research used Federated Averaging methods (Macro, Micro, and Weighted Averages) to convert local knowledge into a comprehensive worldwide outlook. With figures like 83.10% in Macro, 83.76% in Weighted, and 83.64% in Micro averages, cy_5 demonstrated unmatched numerical dominance, although other clients maintained vital metrics like 80.46% (cy_1 Macro) and 78.93% (cy_4 Micro). Federated Averaging was essential in turning local data into global data at this crucial stage. Client-specific information was combined to create a harmonized, universally applicable model, such as the 80.70% accuracy and 83.39% recall of cy_1. The work provides a new diagnostic tool for papaya leaf diseases. It establishes a standard for using decentralized data in conjunction with CNNs and federated learning to address domain-specific problems.","","979-8-3503-6052-3","10.1109/IATMSI60426.2024.10502474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10502474","Papaya leaves;CNN;Distributed learning;Diseases bifurcations;Severity Analysis","Training;Productivity;Technological innovation;Federated learning;Turning;Robustness;Numerical models","","2","","18","IEEE","24 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The classification performance appears inadequate when every original HSI band is in use. In order to improve performance of classification, band (dimensionality) reduction approaches using feature extraction as well as feature selection techniques are widely utilized to mitigate this. Despite the widespread usage of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in HSI feature reduction, it frequently struggles to assess the local beneficial properties of the HSI as it analyzes solely the HSI's global data. Segmented-PCA (SPCA) and Sparse-PCA are initiatives to replace the PCA. In this paper, we propose the Segmented-Sparse-PCA (SSPCA) feature extraction approach nto exploit the amenities of both SPCA and Sparse- PCA. In particular, we first segment the entire dataset into a number of strongly correlated spectral band sub-groups and then apply Sparse-PCA to each subgroup separately. Afterward, the results are analyzed through experimenting over the mixed agricultural Indian Pines HSI dataset using a per-pixel Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experimental results exhibit that the overall classification performance of the proposed SSPCA (91.024%) performs better compared to every other investigated approaches: PCA (83.554%), SPCA (86.774%), Sparse-PCA (88.39%) and the entire original bands of HSI (82.997%).","","979-8-3503-2054-1","10.1109/ICECTE57896.2022.10114537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10114537","Hyperspectral image classification;Feature ex-traction;Remote sensing;PCA;Segmented PCA;Sparse PCA;Segmented Sparse-PCA","Support vector machines;Training;Dimensionality reduction;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Reliability","","4","","15","IEEE","8 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Improper dumping of plastic litter can cause environmental degradation. In particular, the disposal of local plastic litter, sewage sludge landfills and plastic mulch from agricultural activities is a serious problem and a major concern for soil litter. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network-based model called GENII to predict the spatial distribution and quantity of local plastic litter leveraging crowdsensing data. Specifically, we leverage meteorological data to embed the temporal dependency. To represent the spatial dependency, we first use K-means method to cluster the spatial distribution of litter. Based on each cluster, we build multiple graphs leveraging the in-cluster POI and litter distribution, and then apply graph convolutional neural networks and heterogeneous graph attention networks to aggregate neighboring information of these graphs, respectively. Fully connected layers are used for the final litter prediction. Experiments on real-world data verify that our model is effective for the citywide litter prediction, while outperforming multiple prediction models. We expect that the proposed model can be used to improve the city’s litter management system and serve as a better guidance for the city’s plastic litter control.

Flood prediction offers a huge challenge for researchers struggling to predict floods since long time. In this article, flood forecasting model using federated learning technique has been proposed. Federated Learning is the most advanced technique of machine learning (ML) that guarantees data privacy, ensures data availability, promises data security, and handles network latency trials inherent in prediction of floods by prohibiting data to be transferred over the network for model training. Federated Learning technique urges for onsite training of local data models, and focuses on transmission of these local models on the network instead of sending huge data set towards central server for local model aggregation and training of global data model at the central server. In this article, the proposed model integrates locally trained models of eighteen clients, investigates at which station flooding is about to happen and generates flood alert towards a specific client with five days lead time. A local feed forward neural network (FFNN) model is trained at the client station where the flood has been expected. Flood forecasting module of local FFNN model predicts the expected water level by taking multiple regional parameters as input. The dataset of five different rivers and barrages has been collected from 2015 to 2021 considering four aspects including snow melting, rainfall-runoff, flow routing and hydrodynamics. The proposed flood forecasting model has successfully predicted previous floods happened in the selected zone during 2010 to 2015 with 84 % accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3252896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10058950","Hydraulic;meteorological;flood forecasting system;federated learning;feed-forward neural network","Floods;Predictive models;Data models;Forecasting;Servers;Data privacy;Federated learning;Feedforward neural networks;Hydraulic systems","","31","","54","CCBYNCND","6 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the lack of electric power networks in many deployment locations, these sensors rely on energy harvesting (EH) systems that use natural energy sources such as solar power. Specifically, solar-powered EH systems benefit from timely obtaining weather information for efficient future energy scheduling. However, obtaining weather information for EH environmental sensors is always challenging, as they are commonly deployed in harsh environments without network access. To address this problem, we present DynaES, a novel energy scheduling method for EH sensors without relying on online weather forecasts. DynaES comprises two components: a DC power gain estimator that predicts future power gain by individually estimating changes in environmental parameters and ensembling them, and a dynamic energy scheduler that distributes energy to sensors based on priority and adjusts sensing intervals and frequency. We evaluate DynaES via simulation-based studies on real-world datasets and compare its performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Evaluation results show that DynaES accurately predicts future energy gain with low estimation errors and enables $1.8 \times$ – $4 \times$ more frequent sensing operations with shorter sensing intervals while achieving longer operation hours without complete battery drains.","2374-9628","979-8-3503-0293-6","10.1109/IPCCC59175.2023.10253869","U.S. Department of Agriculture; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10253869","IoT;Energy Harvesting;Energy Scheduling","Temperature sensors;Schedules;Temperature distribution;Soil properties;Weather forecasting;Dynamic scheduling;Sensor systems","","1","","34","IEEE","18 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During harvesting, fruit pickers pick fruit into wearable bags and empty these bags into harvesting bins located in the orchard. Once full, these bins are quickly transported to a cooled pack house to improve the shelf life of picked fruits. For farmers and managers, the knowledge of when a picker bag is emptied is important for managing harvesting bins more effectively to minimise the time the picked fruit is left out in the heat (resulting in reduced shelf life). We propose a means to detect these bag-emptying events using human activity recognition with wearable sensors and machine learning methods.

Sub-technology such as PCA and WT have inherent limit with regards to the ability to preserve both spatial and spectral properties. To fill the above-mentioned gaps, this work presents a CAMFNet; a framework that integrates multiscale fusion together with Visible (VIS), Near-Infrared (NIR) and Thermal Infrared (TIR) data for fusion and feature extraction and classification. CAMFNet uses classifiers like Gradient Tree Boost and SVM for differentiating people, cars, trees and other such objects. Feature extraction is carried out using PCA and HOG for enhancing the methods prior to the extraction. One of the radical innovations is the employment of certain aspects in CAMFNet, including multiscale feature extraction and attention mechanisms for boosted data fusion. The framework also involves generative aerial networks (GANs) and it is capable of preserving important spatial and spatial details profiles thereby making it to be more accurate, to more recalls and has low false positives compared to normal methods. Experiments made on real-world datasets coming from different landscapes, revealed that the CAMFNet outperformed the other networks in the classification metrics, as well as in PSNR and SSIM. Surveillance, agriculture, and the military are some of its uses to emphasize work in large-scale and distant investigations.
