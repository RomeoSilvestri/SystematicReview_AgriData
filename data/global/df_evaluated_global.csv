10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2417832,The Impact of National Land Cover and Soils Data on SMOS Soil Moisture Retrieval Over Canadian Agricultural Landscapes,A. Pacheco; H. McNairn; A. Mahmoodi; C. Champagne; Y. H. Kerr,2015,"To ensure sustainable agriculture production, the availability of water in the right quantity and at the right time is critical, with extremes in availability resulting in severe impacts on the agricultural sector. Delivery of timely and accurate soil moisture data can play a vital role in monitoring the status of available water reserves for this sector. Passive microwave sensors, such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), are well suited for monitoring vast landscapes given their all-weather capabilities, large spatial footprint, frequent revisit, and the sensitivity of microwave emissions to the soil dielectric. This study examines the impact of exploiting Canadian soil and land cover datasets in the retrieval of soil moisture from SMOS over an agricultural area in the province of Manitoba (Canada). Results demonstrate that global datasets that are integrated within the current SMOS processor perform adequately when field measured soil moisture is compared to estimates of soil moisture by SMOS (R2 of 0.70 (p <; .01) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 7.15% with a negative (dry) bias of -0.05%). Overall, this study showed that ingesting high-quality national datasets into the SMOS soil moisture retrieval algorithm did not fully resolve the underestimation of soil moisture, suggesting that further investigation is required to understand this bias. Also, several approaches were evaluated to improve statistical field-derived soil moisture representation in the validation of SMOS soil moisture retrieval and it is clear that good representation of soil moisture as a function of soil textures is crucial to accurately validate SMOS soil moisture products.",no,"The study explicitly uses national datasets (Canadian soil and land cover), which violates the global coverage exclusion criterion.",

Parthasarathy,2020,"As we are aware that agriculture is one of the occupations that have a high impact on the countries economy and hence the crop productivity plays a major role. According to the latest survey, today agriculture contributes 17 percent of our countries GDP and about 60 percent of the peoples in the county are dependent on agriculture for their daily needs. The farmers are the backbone of the country; they play a vital role in feeding the entire population of the world. Farming is a beautiful relation between the farmer and the soil; the process of farming is an art that involves various techniques and practices, the productivity of the crop depends on various factors that include soil fertility, weather condition, harvesting period and the practices the farmer follow. In the current situation, the farmers are struggling to get an expected yield from the crop because of various reasons that include large climatic changes and lack of guidance. The objective of this study is to collect the historical data of agriculture, analyze them to predict the crop yield. With the advancement in today’s technology, it is possible to provide suggestion to the farmer regarding the crop selection and the practices to get expected crop yield. One such technique that is gaining more popularity in the field of agriculture is data mining.

This work examines how accurate, computationally efficient real-time plant detection can be achieved on the large and varied benchmarking Open Plant Phenotyping Database, by building upon the State-of-the-Art (SoA) Scaled YOLO v4 real-time object detection model. The effect of pre-processing, namely cropping unnecessary information and increasing contrast, is examined and experimentally shown to improve both accuracy and efficiency. Transfer learning is also leveraged for the deployment of Scaled YOLO v4, using pre-trained weights from the MS COCO data set, and shown to lead to a moderate improvement in accuracy.

Leng; M. Liu; M. Gao,2023,"The monthly mean land surface temperature (MMLST) reflects more stable intra- and interannual temperature variations, and therefore, it has a wider range of applications than instantaneous land surface temperature (LST). This study aimed to generate a high-resolution global MMLST product by temporally upscaling the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1-km instantaneous LST. First, six current methods were comprehensively evaluated using cross-validation technology. These six methods are the cross combinations of two temporal aggregation schemes: the average by observations (ABO) and average by days (ABD), and three conversion models: the diurnal temperature cycle model (DTC), the simple average of two instantaneous LSTs (TSA), and a weighted average model for multiple instantaneous LSTs (MWA). The analysis with measurements from 235 flux stations worldwide revealed that the choice of conversion model considerably affected the overall retrieval accuracy, whereas the influence of the aggregation scheme was minor. From the conversion model standpoint, MWA performed best, followed by DTC, and finally TSA; this order remained the same even if DTC and TSA were improved with mean bias correction. Notably, the errors of ABDMWA decreased as the number of daily mean LST (NOD) increased, whereas the errors of ABOMWA were not related to NOD. Accordingly, we deduced that the optimal strategy for estimating MMLST is using ABOMWA when NOD is < 20 and ABDMWA when NOD is  $\ge 20$ . Subsequently, we adopted this combination method to process MODIS instantaneous LSTs and produced a global 1-km MMLST dataset for the years 2003–2020. The validation showed a satisfactory accuracy with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.6 K. The intercomparison with MMLSTs from geostationary (GEO) satellites (containing complete LST daily cycle) presented a good agreement (biases < 0.3 K and STDs < 2 K). Compared with atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS) L3 monthly standard physical retrieval (AIRS3STM) product which had the same temporal span, the newly generated product exhibited a high consistency in reflecting temporal variations of global temperature. Most importantly, it had a prominently better ability to retrieve spatial details of temperature variations due to its higher resolution. Our new method and product show promising prospects for applications in global change studies, where accurate spatially resolved MMLST data are one of the fundamental geophysical variables required.",yes,"The paper describes the production of a new 'global 1-km MMLST dataset' using global data sources like MODIS and AIRS, which are relevant to agriculture.",MODIS;Atmospheric Infrared Sounder

In this paper, we focus on an agricultural robotics system that addresses the weeding problem by means of selective spraying or mechanical removal of the detected weeds. In particular, we describe a deep learning based method to allow a robot to perform an accurate weed/crop classification using a sequence of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to RGB images. The first network, based on an encoder-decoder segmentation architecture, performs a pixelwise, plant-type agnostic, segmentation between vegetation and soil that enables to extract a set of connected blobs representing plant instances. We show that such network can be trained also using external, ready to use pixel-wise labeled data sets coming from different contexts.

Shafait,2024,"Wheat rust disease is a major agricultural threat, causing significant yield losses globally. Precision agriculture and autonomous robot systems represent pivotal advancements in modern farming and disease detection, leveraging technology to enhance crop management, optimize resource use, and improve productivity. These systems rely heavily on accurate and comprehensive data to train effectively. However, current datasets often fall short of meeting the specific needs of these advanced agricultural technologies. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a primary contribution in the form of an open-source dataset focused on wheat rust disease segmentation for precision agriculture. Open-source datasets in literature are either general plant disease datasets or wheat disease classification datasets. Our proposed wheat rust segmentation dataset, Focussed Rust Disease Images (FRDI), provides close-up views of disease manifestations on wheat leaves, capturing the natural variability and complexity of diseases in field conditions, thereby meeting the requirements of precision agriculture systems. This facilitates detailed analysis and effective training of deep learning models designed for disease detection and segmentation tasks for real-world agricultural environments. Furthermore, in our work we present an improved wheat rust disease detection and segmentation technique which is based on the concept of co-salient feature extraction for disease identification within complex and cluttered field images.

In regions where TCA is deemed unreliable, we use correlation significance levels ( $p$ -values) as indicator for retrieval quality to decide whether to use active data only, passive data only, or an unweighted average. We apply the proposed merging scheme to active retrievals from advanced scatterometer and passive retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer—Earth Observing System using Global Land Data Assimilation System-Noah to complement the triplet required for TCA.

Results show that the  $p$ -value classification provides a robust basis for decisions regarding using either active or passive data alone, or an unweighted average in cases where relative weights cannot be estimated reliably, and that the weights estimated from TCA in almost all cases outperform the ternary decision upon which the ESA CCI SM v02.3 is based.

By incorporating this knowledge, the model first recommends the list of primarily selected crops based on the soil nutrition of a particular user location. Then the predictions of meteorological variables like temperature, rainfall, and humidity are made using SARIMAX models. These weather predictions are then used to forecast the possibilities of diseases for the primary crops list by utilizing the support vector classifier. Finally, the developed model makes use of the decision tree regression model to forecast crop yield and provides a final crop list along with associated possible disease forecast. Utilizing the outcome of the model, farmers may choose the best productive crops as well as prevent crop diseases and reduce output losses by taking preventive actions. Consequently, planning and decision-making processes are supported and farmers can predict possible crop yields.

As smartphones are widely available among farmers across the globe, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) for agricultural data collection becomes a cost-effective and efficient solution by integrating participatory sensing based on a large group of individuals.

Loss of trees caused by the Emerald Ash Borer pest had a significant public health impact due to an increase in mortality related to cardiovascular and respiratory-tract illness [2]. Outbreaks of UG99 wheat rust strain can cause up to 100% crop losses of wheat and is viewed as a potential worldwide disaster with massive implications for global food security [6]. In Canada, an outbreak of Potato Wart disease in 2000 resulted in $280 million in costs to the provincial economy of Prince Edward Island [1]. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has completed decades of risk analyses for various crop commodities and specific pests/pathogens. These analyses characterize the risk of exotic pests to Canada and support regulatory decision-making and response actions. This information is currently stored and maintained in a myriad of disconnected databases, spreadsheets, and technical documents under the control of the Plant Health Risk Assessment Unit. This private corpus represents a unique source of invaluable analyses tailored to the Canadian context, which are not found anywhere else in the world. Additional risk information for other countries is drawn from the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO)1 global database of country regulated pests and the U.S. Department of AgricultureâĂŹs (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regulated plant pest list2. The cost of next generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA has decreased exponentially[10]. As a consequence, academic institutions are aggressively staffing positions in environmental metagenomics, and while these researchers may not be specifically looking for plant pests or pathogens, or even human pathogens, large volumes of data with a wide range of species names will be automatically generated and be made publicly available and searchable on the web. The generation of large amount of DNA sequence data from Canadian samples creates exciting opportunities. At the same time, there is an inherent risk to trade should a quarantine organism in a Canadian sample be detected that is not currently known to exist in Canada. Interpretation or misinterpretation of species identification from such studies at their face value could potentially trigger trade issues. The study seeks to evaluate the benefits and means to actively link quantitative Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) sample data with qualitative risk assessment information. This will guide policy and operational decision-making for rapid detection, surveillance and response against plant health threats and to set a new scientific standard for knowledge-based international trade actions for the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries. One of the goals of this study is to evaluate the use of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to extract pest risk information from the CFIA risk corpus. This study is limited to fungi that are pathogens, partially to limit its initial scope. The fungi are taxonomic group that arguably have some of the most complex taxonomic naming problems due to (among other things) the anamorph-teleomorph-holomorph[8] issue3.

Conventional machine learning (ML)-based algorithms face challenges, especially in identifying the weeds in real-world data due to a lack of features. Deep learning (DL) approaches use self-learning to extract all potential features that assist in classifying malignant weed species accurately. Recently, single deep learning methods achieved high performance in identifying well-separated and illumination but suffered from misclassification in more sophisticated cases such as overlapping and partial occlusion leaves. This paper presents a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model of three state-of-the-art CNNs to classify Rumex obtusifolius. The proposed model utilizes convolutional neural networks to extract features and classify images. The framework of the proposed method comprises three paramount stages to accomplish the classification key idea, including the data preparation phase, pre-processing phase, and classification phase. A hybrid model of three CNN extractor networks is used as the backbone in the classification stage. Our tested data is real-world data that includes multi-circumstances (overlap, occlusion, various illuminations, etc.) acquired from nature. The first extractor is the Visual Graphics Group-16 (VGG-16) for well-separated leaves and non-complicated issues. The second extractor is Residential Energy Services Network-50 (ResNet-50), to overcome complex real-world issues. The third extractor is Inception-v3 to solve the illumination problem. Therefore, combining three networks into one model improves the discriminatory ability to extract additional useful features. The proposed model has been tested using two benchmark datasets for Rumex weed plants. Both of these datasets were captured in real-world environments. The first dataset consists of 900 samples, while the second dataset consists of 677 samples. Each dataset is individually tested in the proposed model to evaluate the classification accuracy using a set of standard evaluation metrics including accuracy, precession, recall, True-Positive Rate (TPR), False-Positive Rate (FPR), and F1-score. The total averages of the proposed model on both datasets are 97.51%, 97.4%, 94.45%, and 95.9% on the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, respectively.",maybe,"The abstract mentions using two benchmark datasets for weed classification, but it does not provide enough information to determine their names, availability, or geographic coverage.",

Stachniss,2018,"Applying agrochemicals is the default procedure for conventional weed control in crop production, but has negative impacts on the environment. Robots have the potential to treat every plant in the field individually and thus can reduce the required use of such chemicals. To achieve that, robots need the ability to identify crops and weeds in the field and must additionally select effective treatments. While certain types of weed can be treated mechanically, other types need to be treated by (selective) spraying. In this paper, we present an approach that provides the necessary information for effective plant-specific treatment. It outputs the stem location for weeds, which allows for mechanical treatments, and the covered area of the weed for selective spraying. Our approach uses an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates stem positions as well as the covered area of crops and weeds. It jointly learns the class-wise stem detection and the pixel-wise semantic segmentation. Experimental evaluations on different real-world datasets show that our approach is able to reliably solve this problem.

Singh,2022,"Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned as a large collection of smart devices that are connected to the Internet and communicate with the goal of realizing a diverse range of applications. These smart devices range from typical home appliances to sophisticated industrial instruments. IoT has numerous applications, such as precision farming, health care, and smart cities. An issue that is prevalent in IoT networks is that due to limited resources, environmental factors, and malicious attacks, some nodes or links fail and adversely affect the functioning of IoT networks. Hence, robustness against the failure of nodes or links is a topic of considerable interest in the area of IoT networks. The robustness of a network is quantified using various spectral graph theoretic measures in network science. One such measure is network criticality which effectively quantifies the robustness against the failure of nodes or communication links. However, this measure can not be used to study the effect of different network parameters for large-scale IoT networks due to huge computational complexity of  $O(n^{3})$ . In this work, we derive the explicit formulas of network criticality for IoT networks using  $r$ -nearest neighbor graphs and show the effect of nearest neighbors and network size on robustness. Our theoretical expressions substantially reduce the computational complexity as compared to existing graph theory-based metrics. We observe that network robustness decreases with the network size and exponentially increases with nearest neighbors. Our work reduces the time complexity of network criticality evaluation from  $O(n^{3})$  to  $O(n)$  for static topologies and to  $O(1)$  for switching topologies.

The existing matching methods can not effectively estimate individual causal effect or solve the problem of dimension curse in causal inference. To address this challenge, in this work, we prove that the reduced set by sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is a balance score for confounding adjustment. Under the theorem, we propose to use an SDR method to obtain a reduced representation set of the original covariates and then the reduced set is used for the matching method. In detail, a non-parametric model is used to learn such a reduced set and to avoid model specification errors. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the compared matching methods.

A Random Forest Classifier examines pixels with similar characteristics in a pool of unlabeled data, and gully objects are detected where high densities of gully pixels are enclosed by an alpha shape. Gully objects are used in subsequent iterations following a mechanism where the algorithm uses the most reliable pixels as gully training samples.

Hattori; Y. Hayashi,2019,"In recent decades, there has been a gradual penetration of plant factories achieving semiautomated crop cultivation. However, efficient energy utilization, as well as quality control of crops, are very important factors with regard to sustainable operation. Operating parameters, such as room temperature, affect not only the quality of crops but also the electric power required to realize the target operation while being influenced by the environment outside the plant. Therefore, a methodology is needed to analyze and interpret the relationships among these manipulated variables, exogenous variables, crop quality, and the amount of required electric power. Constructing a directed acyclic graph composed of regression models is an attractive approach for such analysis; however, the relationships can possibly be nonlinear, so the direct application of existing analytic approaches will not be appropriate. In this paper, we propose a methodology for relationship analysis among variables based on the directed acyclic graphs while identifying the linearity/nonlinearity in their relationships. In general, the construction of such a graphical model has computational issues, especially when the number of variables is large, and the risk of overfitting. The proposed method utilizes the idea of sparse regularization, which has been actively discussed in the field of machine learning, for realizing the automatic identification of linearity/nonlinearity between variables and screening redundant candidate structures; this approach relaxes the computational complexity issue and controls the risk of overfitting.

Recent studies (e.g., SVANN, spatial ensemble) targeting this difficult problem either require a known space-partitioning as the input, or can only support very limited number of partitions or classes (e.g., two) due to the decrease in training data size and the complexity of analysis. To address these limitations, we propose a model-agnostic framework to automatically transform a deep learning model into a spatial-heterogeneity-aware architecture, where the learning of arbitrary space partitionings is guided by a learning-engaged generalization of multivariate scan statistic and parameters are shared based on spatial relationships.

Chen,2024,"A precise and reliable 2-D/3-D positioning solution is a significant advancement for robotics-assisted surveying in forestry automation. Ultrawideband (UWB) positioning, an outstanding technology for high accuracy and high robustness positioning solutions, has emerged as the most promising candidate to serve this application. It has the potential to reduce the meter-level positioning accuracy of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) inside forest canopies down to the decimeter level independent of other sensors/measurements. However, to date, little is known about the actual performance of standalone UWB positioning in these environments. In this article, a detailed performance analysis of a standalone UWB positioning system in a GNSS-denied forest environment with slight and serious non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagations was performed. Positioning accuracy and the effect of the positioning update rate on the accuracy, as well as the time consumption for different positioning methods, were analyzed based on real-world datasets. The results show that the standalone UWB positioning system is able to achieve decimeter-level positioning accuracy that is better than 0.3 m in the OXY plane inside the forest canopy even in the presence of severe NLOS propagations. Therefore, this study provides a valuable reference for positioning solutions in robotics-assisted surveying for forestry automation and also in other location-based applications.",no,"The paper uses datasets from a specific forest environment to test a positioning system.

The proposed framework (ANFIS-FFA), combines the specific structures and strengths of both ANFIS and FFA approaches. The FFA is used to derive the optimum ANFIS parameters. The  $K_{x}$  data set includes 503 cross-sectional data point from small to large rivers. For pre-processing of the data set, the SSMD method is used, which is superior to the classical trial and error method. The database covers a wide range of river width (0.2- 867m), and depths (0.034- 19.9 m). Fifteen different combinations of river width (B), depth (H), flow velocity (U) and shear velocity ( $\text{U}_{\ast }$ ) are implemented as inputs to create fifteen estimative models. The output of the ANFIS-FFA model is compared with the ANFIS and previously published equations to check the performance of the proposed model. The results show that the highest accuracy is attained by the M1 model, with all geometric and hydrodynamic parameters as input variables in comparison with ANFIS and previous equations. The  $\text{R}^{2}$  value, RMSE, MAE and NSE for ANFIS-FFA model are 0.67, 113.14  $\text{m}^{2}$ /s, 48  $\text{m}^{2}$ /s, and 0.63 for proposed dimensional model, and 0.35, 874.5, 520.8, and 0.1 in non-dimensional ANFIS-FFA model, respectively.

However, existing scene text detectors may overfit on the public datasets due to the limited training data, or generate inaccurate localization for arbitrary-shape scene texts. This paper presents an arbitrary-shape scene text detection method that can achieve better generalization ability and more accurate localization. We first propose a Scale-Aware Data Augmentation (SADA) technique to increase the diversity of training samples. SADA considers the scale variations and local visual variations of scene texts, which can effectively relieve the dilemma of limited training data. At the same time, SADA can enrich the training minibatch, which contributes to accelerating the training process. Furthermore, a Shape Similarity Constraint (SSC) technique is exploited to model the global shape structure of arbitrary-shape scene texts and backgrounds from the perspective of the loss function. SSC encourages the segmentation of text or non-text in the candidate boxes to be similar to the corresponding ground truth, which is helpful to localize more accurate boundaries for arbitrary-shape scene texts.

However, due to information inaccuracy, individual non-response and dropout, and sampling biases in observations, the evolving noisy social network that coexists true edges and spurious edges is pervasive in actual applications, where the ignoration of credibility otherness of observed edges could lead to the wrong estimates of social properties and misleading conclusions. To discover credible edge information to shape correct social interactions among individuals, we propose a universal and explainable multiple-neighbor evolutional filtering method (MEFM) to evaluate how credible of observed edges to ‘truly’ exist in the evolving noisy social network. MEFM consists of an evolutional extractor and a filtering evaluator. To resist the noisy disturbance, the evolutional extractor exploits the evolutional states of edges from the perspective of evolution mechanisms within multiple-neighbor ranges, which applies different link prediction algorithms to fit the evolution mechanism in the formation of each edge. Further, the filtering evaluator reconstructs Kalman filter to predict and refine the evolutional states of edges based on their evolving local structures. As a result, MEFM combines the evolutional extractor and the filtering evaluator to analyze the evolutional fluctuations of the observed edges to evaluate their credibility. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed MEFM can effectively and reasonably evaluate edge credibility in evolving noisy social networks.",no,"The paper is about social networks, which is not an agricultural or related field.",

The accuracy, recall, F1-score, support, and accuracy values further validated the robustness and flexibility of the federated CNN model. Extending an integrative perspective, the research used Federated Averaging methods (Macro, Micro, and Weighted Averages) to convert local knowledge into a comprehensive worldwide outlook. With figures like 83.10% in Macro, 83.76% in Weighted, and 83.64% in Micro averages, cy_5 demonstrated unmatched numerical dominance, although other clients maintained vital metrics like 80.46% (cy_1 Macro) and 78.93% (cy_4 Micro). Federated Averaging was essential in turning local data into global data at this crucial stage. Client-specific information was combined to create a harmonized, universally applicable model, such as the 80.70% accuracy and 83.39% recall of cy_1.

Afjal,2022,"Remote sensing hyperspectral images (HSI) are typically acquired to obtain critical information about the land covers via adjacent cramped spectral wavelength bands. The classification performance appears inadequate when every original HSI band is in use. In order to improve performance of classification, band (dimensionality) reduction approaches using feature extraction as well as feature selection techniques are widely utilized to mitigate this. Despite the widespread usage of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in HSI feature reduction, it frequently struggles to assess the local beneficial properties of the HSI as it analyzes solely the HSI's global data. Segmented-PCA (SPCA) and Sparse-PCA are initiatives to replace the PCA.

Flood prediction offers a huge challenge for researchers struggling to predict floods since long time. In this article, flood forecasting model using federated learning technique has been proposed. Federated Learning is the most advanced technique of machine learning (ML) that guarantees data privacy, ensures data availability, promises data security, and handles network latency trials inherent in prediction of floods by prohibiting data to be transferred over the network for model training. Federated Learning technique urges for onsite training of local data models, and focuses on transmission of these local models on the network instead of sending huge data set towards central server for local model aggregation and training of global data model at the central server. In this article, the proposed model integrates locally trained models of eighteen clients, investigates at which station flooding is about to happen and generates flood alert towards a specific client with five days lead time. A local feed forward neural network (FFNN) model is trained at the client station where the flood has been expected. Flood forecasting module of local FFNN model predicts the expected water level by taking multiple regional parameters as input. The dataset of five different rivers and barrages has been collected from 2015 to 2021 considering four aspects including snow melting, rainfall-runoff, flow routing and hydrodynamics.

Due to the lack of electric power networks in many deployment locations, these sensors rely on energy harvesting (EH) systems that use natural energy sources such as solar power. Specifically, solar-powered EH systems benefit from timely obtaining weather information for efficient future energy scheduling. However, obtaining weather information for EH environmental sensors is always challenging, as they are commonly deployed in harsh environments without network access. To address this problem, we present DynaES, a novel energy scheduling method for EH sensors without relying on online weather forecasts. DynaES comprises two components: a DC power gain estimator that predicts future power gain by individually estimating changes in environmental parameters and ensembling them, and a dynamic energy scheduler that distributes energy to sensors based on priority and adjusts sensing intervals and frequency. We evaluate DynaES via simulation-based studies on real-world datasets and compare its performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Evaluation results show that DynaES accurately predicts future energy gain with low estimation errors and enables $1.8 \times$ – $4 \times$ more frequent sensing operations with shorter sensing intervals while achieving longer operation hours without complete battery drains.",maybe,"The abstract mentions using 'real-world datasets' related to soil properties, but does not specify the name, availability, or geographic scope of the data.",

For farmers and managers, the knowledge of when a picker bag is emptied is important for managing harvesting bins more effectively to minimise the time the picked fruit is left out in the heat (resulting in reduced shelf life).

However, global warming, characterized by elevated temperatures, water shortage, and increased drought stress, has significantly impacted GPP. Various GPP products based on different algorithms and input data have been developed, but their performance under extreme climatic conditions remains unverified. This study evaluated the consistency and accuracy of eight global GPP products from 2003 to 2014 using flux towers data. The results show that GPP products performed well under overall conditions, with an average correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.604, and Penman-Monteith-Leuning-version-2 (PMLv2) showed the best performance (R2 = 0.664). However, under extreme climatic conditions like high temperature, high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and drought, the accuracy significantly dropped (R2 = 0.3), with Global-dataset-of-solar-induced-chlorophyll-fluorescence (GOSIF) being the most affected. Accuracy was lower in croplands (CRO) and grasslands (GRA). To enhance accuracy under extreme climatic conditions, GPP products were used as inputs to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on ECMWF-Reanalysis-5th-Generation (ERA5) meteorological data and compared with random forests (RF).

This is likely to worsen food insecurity in some countries, calling for efforts to close the yield gap as much as possible. Estimating the yield gap and its drivers is essential for devising strategies to increase yields. This study quantifies the wheat yield gap in Morocco's five major wheat production regions. It analyzes the historical sensitivity of wheat yield to temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture, which are important factors affecting agricultural productivity. Furthermore, it evaluates how these yield gaps impact the revenue of producers in these regions. This analysis was conducted using datasets, including the Global Dataset of Historical Yield (GDHY) for yield gap assessment, soil moisture data, ERA5 reanalysis data, and CHIRPS datasets for climate assessment from 1982 to 2016. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were employed to reflect the variation characteristics of wheat yield and to identify the impacts of precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture on wheat yield. Results: High regional differences in wheat yield gaps were observed, with values ranging from 1.64 t/ha in Casablanca Settat to 4.12 t/ha in Marrakech Safi, and temporal variability ranging from 9 to 18%. Wheat yields were found to be strongly correlated with rainfall, particularly from December to March. Temperature fluctuations had a significant negative impact on wheat yield across the regions. Soil moisture was positively correlated with wheat yields throughout all growing periods, showing the strongest impacts during the early vegetative development phase. Additionally, losses due to wheat yield gaps were considerable, ranging between $ 194 and 891 per hectare. The revenue loss due to Yield Gap I ranged from 49 to 71%, while the loss due to Yield Gap II ranged from 240 to 444%, depending on the method used to calculate the wheat yield gap. Conclusions: Results reveal gaps in wheat yield, forming a basis for process-based modeling to understand crop yield gap drivers. Understanding yield gap drivers will play a pivotal role in evidence-based intervention strategies to enhance yields. By applying such strategies, it is possible to not only manage and reduce the variability in wheat production, but also ensure sustainable agricultural practices and achieve food security in Morocco and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses several global datasets (GDHY, ERA5, CHIRPS) for an agricultural study on wheat yield, meeting all inclusion criteria.",Global Dataset of Historical Yield;ERA5;CHIRPS

However, there remains a knowledge gap regarding the role of different crop types in maintaining biodiversity within the agricultural landscape. By extracting biodiversity data from global datasets and classifying different crop types, we quantified the contribution of different crop types to biodiversity. Our results indicate that biodiversity levels vary widely among crop types. We found a general loss of biodiversity when natural vegetation is converted to agricultural land, and highest losses in fiber crops, cereals and oil crops, and least in other crops (such as coffee or cocoa) and in mixed crops. In general, perennial crops retain more biodiversity than annual crops. Losses of biodiversity can be mitigated through mixed cropping of multiple crop types, especially by combining annual and perennial crops. The negative impact of converting natural vegetation to agriculture is greater in tropical than in nontropical areas, and hence, the import of commodities from these biodiversity-rich regions may be particularly detrimental. Given the ongoing increase in biodiversity losses from global intensification and expansion of agricultural land, maintaining or restoring natural vegetation, rating the crop-type-specific biodiversity, diversifying crops, and preferring perennial over annual crops, particularly in the tropics, need to be better considered and implemented in global agri-environmental schemes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract states the use of 'global datasets' to study the impact of crop types on biodiversity, which is an agriculture-related topic with a global scope.",

The new framework reported in this manuscript is based on kernel-induced distance matric using the Gaussian Radial Basis Function (GRBF), and the proposed algorithm is named as Distributed Kernel-based Weighted Fuzzy C-Means (DKWFCM) algorithm. In wireless sensor networks (WSN), Distributed approaches perform the clustering task across network nodes, mitigating privacy risks, reducing communication overhead, and adapting to network dynamics. Feature-weight and cluster-weight learning are incorporated for more effective cluster analysis in distributed environments. Additionally, DKWFCM leverages diffusion-based learning to enable information processing across multiple wireless sensor nodes. The proposed algorithm DKWFCM performance is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets distributed over six wireless sensor nodes. Five datasets for validation which consists of two Synthetic datasets (Circle_3_2, Mixed_3_2) and three real-world datasets (the Cook Agricultural land dataset, Thames River water quality dataset, and Canada Weather station dataset). Performance is assessed using the Silhouette Index (SI) and Dunn Index (DI) as a validation measures. Simulation results demonstrated the superior performance of DKWFCM over traditional FCM algorithms such as Distributed FCM (DFCM) algorithm and Distributed Weighted FCM (DWFCM). The superiority is evident in various aspects, such as visual clusters obtained at each node, SI value, DI value plots at the sensor nodes, and average convergence plots.

There is a body of literature linking increasingly intense, large fires to a build-up of fuel from rural land abandonment exacerbated by climate change. However, a better understanding of the complex factors driving fires in fire-prone landscapes is needed. We use a global database based on the MODIS Fire CCI51 product, and the Greater Côa Valley, a 340,000-ha area in Portugal, as a case study, to investigate the environmental drivers of fire and potential tools for managing fires in a landscape that has undergone changing agricultural and grazing management. Results: Between 2001 and 2020, fires burned 32% (1881.45 km2) of the study area. Scrublands proportionally burnt the most, but agricultural land and forests were also greatly impacted. The risk of large fires (> 1 km2) was highest in these land cover types under dry conditions in late summer. Areas with higher sheep densities were more likely to burn, while cattle density had no apparent relationship with fire occurrence. There was also a 15% lower probability of a fire occurring in protected areas. Conclusion: Future climatic changes that increase drought conditions will likely elevate the risk of large fires in the Mediterranean basin, and abandoned farmland undergoing natural succession towards scrubland will be at particularly high risk.

The mean hazard indices of the nine PTMs were 2.91 and 0.59 for children and adults, with 85.6% and 13.3% of non-carcinogenic risks for children and adults that exceeded the safe level of 1, respectively. In addition, 70.2% and 56.7% of the total cancer risks through exposure to five carcinogenic PTMs in children and adults, respectively, exceeded the safety level. As and Hg showed a high exceedance of non-carcinogenic risks, while As and Ni were the leading contributors to carcinogenic risks.

Soil extracellular enzymes play an important role in the transformation of elements and compounds in soil, particularly acid (ACP) and alkaline (ALP) phosphatases (both, APases). These enzymes have a vital role in releasing phosphorus (P) from organic matter. However, the effect of climate variables and agro-ecosystem management on APase activity in croplands remains unclear, as does its eventual relationship with agricultural productivity. Therefore, we compiled a global database of APase activity in croplands (between 1977 and 2022) and we analysed 5876 observations across 474 papers to study climate variables, crop family, and management effects on ACP and ALP activity, and their relationship with yield. ACP activity is reduced by higher temperatures (p<0.001) and lower rainfall (p=0.002). There was an interaction effect of temperature and precipitation on ALP activity (p=0.046), with the negative effect of temperature being stronger with high precipitation, and low precipitation showing low ALP activity levels at any temperature. The crop family greatly influenced APase activity (p<0.001). Management practices affected ACP and ALP activity differently; ACP activity was positively influenced by organic fertilization combined with, crop rotation or irrigation by an average of 15.6 % and 30.7 %, respectively. ALP activity was mainly positively influenced by the interaction of two different factors: organic or inorganic-organic fertilization and reduced or zero tillage. Further understanding of soil enzyme mechanisms would aid global food security and yield. As ACP activity doubles from 100.0 to 200.0 mg pNP kg−1h−1, the crop yield increases by more than two-fold, an outcome not demonstrated in croplands until now. These results could enhance yield potential through the promotion of APase activity, and the consideration of climate variables and agro-ecosystem management, which could ultimately improve cost-benefit ratios for sustainable crop growth. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The abstract describes the compilation and use of a global database on soil phosphatase activity in croplands.,

A common meteorological drought index used for drought monitoring and water resource management is the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Using SPEI can assist in predicting drought onset and estimating drought severity. The objective of this research is to assess the accuracy of machine learning models in estimating the SPEI-1 (one-month) index in semi-arid climates. To achieve this goal, the data will be analyzed using remote sensing parameters, a worldwide database, and meteorological station information. SPEI-1 was predicted in Tabriz, Iran, between 1990 and 2022 using multilayer perceptron (MLP) and random forest (RF) techniques combined with genetic algorithm (GA) methods. The parameters used are average air temperature, average relative humidity, monthly precipitation, wind speed, sunny hours, as well as the one-month standard precipitation index (SPI-1) (from ground data), daily precipitation products from satellites named PERSIANN (PRC-PR) (from remote sensing), and SPEIbase data (from global databases). The results suggest that the use of satellite remote sensing characteristics and global databases has significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of prediction models. Based on the GA-RF model with an R2 of 0.992 and an RMSE of 0.124, it exhibits the best performance among all models in Scenario 1.

To identify key underlying drivers of total SOC distributions, we compiled a global dataset of soil C stocks held in three chemical forms, reflecting different mechanisms of organic C protection: free particulate organic C (fPOC), physically protected particulate organic C (oPOC), and mineral-protected soil organic C (mSOC). In our dataset, these three SOC pools were differentially sensitive to the effects of climate, soil mineralogy, and ecosystem type, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between physical and chemical C protection mechanisms. C stocks in all three pools varied among ecosystems: cropland soils stored the least amount in each pool, with forest and grassland soils both containing significantly more fPOC (40%–60% greater in each ecosystem) than croplands. oPOC stocks did not significantly differ from zero in croplands but were substantial in forest and grassland soils. Meanwhile, mSOC stocks were the greatest in grasslands and shrublands (90%–100% greater than croplands). In cropland soils, there were no major effects of tillage on C storage in any of the three pools, while manure addition enhanced mSOC stocks, especially when added with inorganic N. Thus, the human land use intensity in croplands appears to reduce SOC storage in all major pools, depending upon management; retaining native vegetation should be emphasized to maintain current global SOC stocks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract describes the compilation and use of a global dataset of soil carbon stocks, which is relevant to agriculture and land use.",

In addition to the regional cropland area reconstructions, improving the grid allocation method is another feasible way to raise the reliability of historical LUCC data. In this study, an integrated reconstruction of the national cropland areas over the past 200 years was developed for 36 European countries. After that, the allocation algorithm was built using physiogeographic variables and historical city sites for accounting for land suitability and cultivation preferences, respectively. Finally, cropland data in Europe with a spatial resolution of 5′×5′ at five time sections from AD 1800 to 2000 were generated using the optimal allocation algorithm in accordance with the stages of the regional history. The results were as follows: (1) The dominant factors governing the distribution of croplands in Europe vary at different agricultural stages, but the results can be merged together. Land suitability was more optimal for allocation during the modern agricultural stage (AD 1950 and 2000); the priority index combined with land suitability and cultivation preference was more reasonable for allocation during the traditional agricultural stage (AD 1800). The average of the allocations by priority index and the land suitability could be adopted as the allocation results during the transitional stage (AD 1850 and 1900) because the grids for absolute differences within ±10 and ±20 percentage points between the results obtained from the above two allocations were above 80% and 95%, respectively, which means the two allocation results could be merged. (2) Over the past 200 years, the total cropland area in Europe first increased to a peak in AD 1900 and then decreased.

However, these indicators do not reflect the contribution of inherent soil productivity, which can supply half of crop demand and is therefore a core principle in determining how much fertilizer is needed and the corresponding risk of N losses. Using a global dataset of optimal N rates for crop production, we evaluated the performance of conventional (N recovery efficiency) and simplified NUE indicators to understand their relationship and respective limitations, helping inform policy efforts for simultaneously meeting food production and sustainability goals. A key finding is that conventional agronomic approaches designed to optimize crop productivity and profit related to N fertilizer inputs have tradeoffs for environmental performance, with only 35 and 31 % of observations (n=448) falling within sustainable ranges for NUE. Meanwhile, simplified NUE indicators such as N balance or the ratio of N outputs to inputs were unable to detect sites with inherently low N recovery efficiency and high risk of N losses, highlighting a weakness of neglecting soil N supply in their calculations. Together these results suggest the need for a combined approach that merges insights from locally available agronomic data on N recovery efficiency with global environmental thresholds for NUE.

Different governments and institutions established national systems to describe thematic content of land within their jurisdictions. These systems are all valid and tuned to address various national needs. However, their integration at regional or global levels is lacking.

Leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles, we can efficiently acquire high-resolution spatiotemporal samples by utilizing remote sensors. However, non-linear relationships among data features, localized within specific subgroups, frequently emerge in agricultural data. Interpreting these complex patterns requires sophisticated analysis due to the presence of noise, high variability, and non-stationarity behavior in the collected samples. Here, we introduce Local Biplot, a methodological framework tailored for discerning meaningful data patterns in non-stationary contexts for precision agriculture. Local Biplot relies on the well-known uniform manifold approximation and projection method, such as UMAP, and local affine transformations to codify non-stationary and non-linear data patterns while maintaining interpretability. This lets us find important clusters for transformation and projection within a single global axis pair. Hence, our framework encompasses variable and observational contributions within individual clusters. At the same time, we provide a relevance analysis strategy to help explain why those clusters exist, facilitating the understanding of data dynamics while favoring interpretability. We demonstrated our method’s capabilities through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, covering scenarios involving grass and rice crops. Moreover, we use random forest and linear regression models to predict water status variables from our Local Biplot-based feature ranking and clusters.

The accuracy of the global database data was assessed using statistical criteria in both single- and multi-product approaches for the aforementioned four variables. In addition, five different feature selection methods were employed to select the best single condition indices (SCIs) as input for the support vector regression (SVR) model.

With increased duration, the changes in soil N availability might affect microbial and plant growth and consequently regulate the intercropping effects on SOC sequestration. However, the response of intercropping effects on SOC components to soil N availability has been poorly explored. In this study, we constructed a global database with 939 paired data (intercropping vs. monoculture) from 60 publications. We found that intercropping increased SOC (by 7.94%), microbial biomass carbon (MBC, by 23.73%), particulate organic carbon (POC, by 23.27%), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, by 16.46%) compared to monoculture. The intercropping effects (percentage change, %) on SOC content strongly depends on soil N availability (soil C: N) and the interactions with duration and crop types. In N-limited soils (soil C: N > 15), intercropping increased SOC and POC contents by 14% and 31%, respectively, which were 2–3 times higher than those in N-rich soils (soil C: N < 15). It implies higher intercropping effects in more N-limited soils. In addition, intercropping increased MBC:SOC by 63% in N-limited but not in N-rich soils, indicating greater contributions of microbial-derived C to SOC storage in N-limited but not in N-rich soils. This might be attributed to that the stimulated microbial decomposition of soil organic matter counterbalanced the microbial-derived C accumulation in N-rich soils. Taken together, these results indicate that soil N availability regulates the intercropping effects on SOC content and the contributions of microbial-derived C to SOC storage. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of soil N availability on SOC content with intercropping, implying that intercropping is a suitable agricultural approach especially in N-limited soils and nutrient management should be carefully considered in long-term intercropping experiments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The abstract describes the construction and use of a global database from published literature to study intercropping effects.,

Furthermore, the periods of water stress were little affected by the use of local or global data (median accuracy: 0.84), whereas the use of global data inputs led to a significant overestimation of irrigation water requirements (median difference: 110 mm). The model performance improves predominantly through the use of more representative local precipitation data, followed by local reference evapotranspiration and soil for some European growing seasons. We identify model outputs that can support decision-making when relying on global data, such as periods of water stress and the daily dynamics of water use. However, our findings also emphasize the difficulty of overcoming data scarcity in decision-making in agricultural water management. Furthermore, we provide recommendations for enhancing model performance and thus may increase the accessibility of reliable decision support tools in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract explicitly states the use of global datasets, including FLUXNET2015, for agricultural water management modeling.",FLUXNET2015

The hyperspectral identification of rice seeds is of great significance to the development of agriculture and hence has made remarkable achievements. However, the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets with a large number of rice seeds hinders the generalization of models and limits the advancement of the field. To address this issue, this study proposes a publicly accessible dataset for rice seed classification by hyperspectral imaging system. The proposed dataset contains 6 categories of nearly 10,000 seeds each and is characterized by (1) a large scale on the number of seeds per category and the total seed number; (2) a greater adherence to real-world scenarios; and (3) high intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity. Based on the proposed dataset, an Instance Difficulty-weighted K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (IDKNN) is further proposed. It is a credible algorithm, emphasizing individual seed accuracy rather than overall performance. Additionally, we explore the effects of different Regions Of Interest (ROI).

However, current knowledge of climate change impacts in this region is largely derived from coarse-grid global datasets that lack sufficient detail for local applications. The derived impacts are thus generalized across large spatial scales, with a limited representation the differential exposure across the region. It is thus necessary to conduct localized assessments to derive local vulnerabilities and develop context-specific mitigation strategies. This study utilizes downscaled outputs from regional climate models to quantify the effects of climate change on maize and sugarcane crops at catchment-scale, hereby the Nyando catchment in Kenya. The findings indicate that climate change will reduce the suitability of conditions to the growth of both crops, with sub-optimal conditions for maize increasing by up to 600%. The analysis of crop yields show that maize yields are projected to decline by about 23.9% under the RCP4.5 scenario and 29.4% under RCP8.5. Sugarcane yields are similarly projected to decrease by 17.0% and 28.6% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. The underlying climatic changes suggest that future warming outweighs the effects of precipitation in explaining crop yield declines. More broadly, the methodology applied in this study can be readily adapted and utilized for agricultural areas throughout the Sub-Saharan region.

With modern technologies, farmers can use substances like pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers at precise dosages or to identify places on a field with specific production rates. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to introduce a novel and a unique aerial image dataset of various fields acquired by UAV containing crops/weeds in the early phenophases captured in two different resolutions (2 mm and 7 mm per pixel). Secondly, the best super-resolution technique for high-resolution images, substitution with lower resolution is explored. METHODS: For data acquisition, we employed DJI Matrice 600 equipped with a full-frame Sony Alpha A7R IV285 image sensor. Data were captured at flight heights of 26 and 95 m from 4 different fields in Central Europe. In addition, we proposed a methodology focused on the selection of an appropriate super-resolution method to enhance low-resolution aerial images to obtain better accuracy of crop/weed detection. As a baseline crop/weed detector for super-resolution effect evaluation, YOLOv5 architecture was used. Next, we explored the performance of several super-resolution models (U-Net++, ESRGAN, SwinIR), and fine-tuned the best-performed one. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We present the new dataset named SPAGRI-AI: a novel unique dataset of aerial images for super-resolution experiments in smart precision agriculture. The dataset contains 27,638 aerial images (1024 × 1024 px) and additionally, it contains a subset of 2014 labeled images with 45,548 bounding boxes of 12 classes. The main purpose of the SPAGRI-AI is to provide the scientific community with real-world data to test new methods for super-resolution (SR) and crop/weed detection. During the evaluation of selected super-resolution models, the YOLOv5 model trained on high-resolution images resulted in corn mAP@0.5 of 94.48%. The YOLOv5 model trained on low-resolution images resulted in corn mAP@0.5 of only 51.43%. Nevertheless, if the low-resolution images were pre-processed using the SwinIR super-resolution method, corn mAP@0.5 of 62.36% was achieved. SIGNIFICANCE: To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the largest datasets available to the paper's publication date. Overall, the SPAGRI-AI dataset and the findings from our experiments contribute to the advancement of super-resolution techniques and crop/weed detection methods in the field of smart agriculture.

But it is more uncertain and difficult to forecast than industrial, commercial, and residential loads. Multivariate time series prediction methods have problems such as poor refinement of weather services and difficulty in quantifying the influencing factors. Univariate time series prediction methods should be emphasized, and the characteristic information in the historical load data should be fully exploited. Therefore, this paper systematically investigates the decomposition strategy and attention-based recurrent neural network for univariate time-series multi-step prediction. The decomposition strategy is employed to generate derived variable sequences from the target sequence as inputs for the model, while the dual-stage attention mechanism is used for dynamically selecting features. A one-year real-world dataset of agricultural power loads in southern China is used for validation. The effectiveness of two different decomposition algorithms on dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DARNN) is discussed, then the proposed ensemble empirical mode decomposition and dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (EEMD-DARNN) is compared with four univariate time series prediction models and three ablation models. The proposed model is optimal in four evaluation indicators, with R2, RMSE, MAPE, and MAE of 0.970, 12.298, 0.040, and 7.335 respectively in the shortest forecast horizon (15 min), and 0.941, 17.305, 0.065 and 11.347 respectively in the longest forecast horizon (1 h).

This study aimed to integrate global data on solanaceous crop pollination and analyse the interaction patterns using a meta-network approach. Our questions were: (i) how are interactions structured and what are the structuring roles of species; and (ii) what are the main gaps in our knowledge? Data were obtained through a systematic review of the main scientific databases. The network structure was described using connectivity and modularity calculations, and the role of species using centrality metrics.

The meta-network was modular, and all modules mostly included bees. Most species were peripherals, around 12% were connectors, and there were no module hubs. Apis mellifera was the only network hub (supergeneralist). The most important pollinators are the most managed pollinators worldwide; however, many native species play a role in structuring the meta-network.

Using meta-analytic, phylogenetic and multivariate methods, we show that beyond agricultural features, filtering by the extent of natural environmental variability and the severity of historical anthropogenic deforestation shapes the varying deforestation impacts across species assemblages. For assemblages under greater environmental variability—proxied by drier and more seasonal climates under a greater disturbance regime—and longer deforestation histories, filtering has attenuated the negative impacts of current deforestation by selecting for functional traits linked to stronger deforestation tolerance.

In the district of Boane, located a few kilometres downstream of the Pequenos Libombos dam, the flood destroyed many food crops as well as two bridges linking the district to Maputo, thus affecting the food security of the population. These events are quite frequent in this region, making the delineation of improved flood hazard maps and the development of new flood risk management plans necessary.

Wind power, as a renewable energy source, can replace non-renewable energy sources to reduce energy costs and improve the sustainability of agricultural. However, the inherent intermittency, randomness, and volatility within weather conditions and wind speed presents a substantial challenge in accurately predicting wind power generation. This work proposes a novel YJQR-LSTM algorithm that leverages Yeo-Johnson quantile regression (YJQR) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for nonparametric probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation via the Intelligent Internet of Things.

Sources of errors could be related to the spatial resolution of the images used, the land-cover mask adopted to avoid false alarms, and the quality of the cloud and shadow masks. This paper aims to compare different burnt areas datasets (EFFIS, ESACCI, Copernicus, FIRMS, etc.) with the objective to analyse their differences. The comparison is restricted to the Italian territory. Furthermore, the paper aims to identify the degree of approximation of these satellite-based datasets by relying on ground survey data as ground truth. To do so, ground survey data provided by CUFA (Comando Unità Forestali, Ambientali e Agroalimentari Carabinieri) and CFVA (Corpo Forestale e Vigilanza Ambientale Sardegna) were used. The results confirm the existence of significant differences between the datasets. The subsequent comparison with the ground surveys, which was conducted while also taking into account their own approximations, allowed us to identify the accuracy of the satellite-based datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract describes a comparison of multiple named global datasets (EFFIS, ESACCI, Copernicus, FIRMS) related to land use, meeting all inclusion criteria.",EFFIS;ESACCI;Copernicus;FIRMS;CUFA;CFVA

As such, research related to the effect of ecosystem services and diversity on crop yields has increased significantly in the past decade. One such study by Dainese and colleagues that presented a global synthesis of a compiled database of 1,475 crop experiments related to pollination and pest control ecosystem services and crop yields quickly garnered attention in the literature with more than 540 citations since its publication in 2019. Given the strong influence of this study on the research on diversity and agricultural production, we conduct a reanalysis on the publicly available dataset from the global synthesis study to test the robustness of findings to modeling approach and assumptions. In our reanalysis we apply ordinary least squares regression methods rather than Bayesian path analysis to the same data to examine the robustness of observed field-scale landscape diversity-ecosystem services- crop yield relationships. The result of our reanalysis supports the findings of Dainese and colleagues, illustrating the robustness of findings that suggest that increasing landscape simplicity is associated with lower rates of pollination and pest control ecosystem service provisioning and lower crop yields. However, our analyses also suggest that provisioning of pollination and pest control services account for only a small fraction of the total effect of landscape simplicity on crop yields. Furthermore, we find that management and soil health may mediate the effects of landscape simplicity on ecosystem services and crop yields. While our results complement previous findings for landscape simplicity and ecosystem services, they also indicate that above and below ground ecosystem services are not mutually exclusive but concurrently contribute to support crop production in agriculture. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract describes a reanalysis of a 'publicly available dataset from the global synthesis study' related to crop yield, meeting all inclusion criteria.",
10.1111/gcbb.13102,Potential for biochar carbon sequestration from crop residues: A global spatially explicit assessment,"S.K., Karan, Shivesh Kishore; D., Woolf, Dominic; E.S., Azzi, Elias Sebastian; C., Sundberg, Cecilia; S.A., Wood, Stephen A.",2023,"Global warming necessitates urgent action to reduce carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) emissions and remove CO<inf>2</inf> from the atmosphere. Biochar, a type of carbonized biomass which can be produced from crop residues (CRs), offers a promising solution for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) when it is used to sequester photosynthetically fixed carbon that would otherwise have been returned to atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> through respiration or combustion. However, high-resolution spatially explicit maps of CR resources and their capacity for climate change mitigation through biochar production are currently lacking, with previous global studies relying on coarse (mostly country scale) aggregated statistics. By developing a comprehensive high spatial resolution global dataset of CR production, we show that, globally, CRs generate around 2.4 Pg C annually. If 100% of these residues were utilized, the maximum theoretical technical potential for biochar production from CRs amounts to 1.0 Pg C year−1 (3.7 Pg CO<inf>2</inf>e year−1). The permanence of biochar differs across regions, with the fraction of initial carbon that remains after 100 years ranging from 60% in warm climates to nearly 100% in cryosols. Assuming that biochar is sequestered in soils close to point of production, approximately 0.72 Pg C year−1 (2.6 Pg CO<inf>2</inf>e year−1) of the technical potential would remain sequestered after 100 years. However, when considering limitations on sustainable residue harvesting and competing livestock usage, the global biochar production potential decreases to 0.51 Pg C year−1 (1.9 Pg CO<inf>2</inf>e year−1), with 0.36 Pg C year−1 (1.3 Pg CO<inf>2</inf>e year−1) remaining sequestered after a century. Twelve countries have the technical potential to sequester over one fifth of their current emissions as biochar from CRs, with Bhutan (68%) and India (53%) having the largest ratios. The high-resolution maps of CR production and biochar sequestration potential provided here will provide valuable insights and support decision-making related to biochar production and investment in biochar production capacity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper describes the development of a 'comprehensive high spatial resolution global dataset' of crop residue production, meeting all inclusion criteria.",

Accurate and early detection of tomato diseases is crucial for reducing losses and improving crop management. Current deep learning and CNN research have resulted in the availability of multiple CNN designs, making automated plant disease identification viable rather than traditional visual inspection-based disease detection. When using deep learning Methods, the dataset serves one of the most crucial roles in disease prediction. PlantVillage is the most widely used publicly available dataset for tomato disease detection, but it was created in a laboratory/controlled environment, and models trained on it do not perform well on real-world images. Some natural or real-world datasets are available, but they are private and not publicly available. Also, when attempting to predict tomato diseases on the field in the Jodhpur and Jaipur districts of Rajasthan, India, we found that the majority of diseases are leaf miner, spotted wilt virus, and Nnutrition deficiency diseases, but there are no public datasets containing such categories. To overcome these challenges, we propose the creation of a new dataset called “Tomato-Village” with three variants: (a) multiclass tomato disease classification, (b) multilabel tomato disease classification, and (c) object detection-based tomato disease detection. To our best knowledge, “Tomato-Village” will be the first such dataset to be available publicly.

However, accurate recharge estimation is a challenge, especially in data-scarce regions, as the existing models are data-intensive and require extensive parameterization. This study developed a process-based hydrologic model combining local and remotely sensed data for characterizing recharge in data-limited regions using a Basin Characterization Model (BCM). This study was conducted in Raya and Kobo Valleys, a semi-arid region in Northern Ethiopia, considering both the structural basin and the surrounding mountainous recharge areas. Climatic Research Unit monthly datasets for 1991 to 2020 and WaPOR actual evapotranspiration data were used. The model results show that the average annual recharge and surface runoff from 1991 to 2020 were 73 mm and 167 mm, respectively, with a substantial portion contributed along the front of the mountainous parts of the study area. The mountainous recharge occurred along and above the valleys as mountain-block and mountain-front recharge. The long-term estimates of the monthly recharge time series indicated that the water balance components follow the temporal pattern of rainfall amount. However, the relation of recharge to precipitation was nonlinearly related, showing the episodic nature of recharge in semi-arid regions. This study informed the spatial and temporal distribution of recharge and runoff hydrologic variables at fine spatial scales for each grid cell, allowing results to be summarized for various planning units, including farmlands. One third of the precipitation in the drainage basin becomes recharge and runoff, while the remaining is lost through evapotranspiration. The current study’s findings are vital for developing plans for sustainable management of water resources in semi-arid regions. Also, monthly groundwater withdrawals for agriculture should be regulated in relation to spatial and temporal recharge patterns. We conclude that combining scarce local data with global datasets and tools is a useful approach for estimating recharge to manage groundwater resources in data-scarce regions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract mentions the use of specific global datasets ('Climatic Research Unit monthly datasets' and 'WaPOR') for hydrological modeling relevant to agriculture, meeting all criteria.",Climatic Research Unit;WaPOR

Unlike human faces, the faces of most Hanwoo cattle, a native breed of Korea, exhibit significant similarities and have the same body color, posing a substantial challenge in accurately distinguishing between individual cattle. In this study, we sought to extend the closed-set scope (only including identifying known individuals) to a more-adaptable open-set recognition scenario (identifying both known and unknown individuals) termed Cattle’s Face Open-Set Recognition (CFOSR). By integrating open-set techniques to enhance the closed-set accuracy, the proposed method simultaneously addresses the open-set scenario. In CFOSR, the objective is to develop a trained model capable of accurately identifying known individuals, while effectively handling unknown or novel individuals, even in cases where the model has been trained solely on known individuals. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates Adversarial Reciprocal Points Learning (ARPL), a state-of-the-art open-set recognition method, with the effectiveness of Additive Margin Softmax loss (AM-Softmax). ARPL was leveraged to mitigate the overlap between spaces of known and unknown or unregistered cattle. At the same time, AM-Softmax was chosen over the conventional Cross-Entropy loss (CE) to classify known individuals. The empirical results obtained from a real-world dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the ARPL and AM-Softmax techniques in achieving both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Notably, the results of the open-set recognition and closed-set recognition validated the superior performance of our proposed method compared to existing algorithms. To be more precise, our method achieved an AUROC of 91.84 and an OSCR of 87.85 in the context of open-set recognition on a complex dataset. Simultaneously, it demonstrated an accuracy of 94.46 for closed-set recognition. We believe that our study provides a novel vision to improve the classification accuracy of the closed set.

Data analytics and modeling tools play a key role in fighting this challenge, as they can help identify key sources as well as trace transport and quantify impact within complex hydrological systems. Several tools exist for simulating and tracing pollutant transport throughout surface waters using detailed physical models; these tools are powerful, but can be computationally intensive, require significant amounts of data to be developed, and require expert knowledge for their use (ultimately limiting application scope). In this work, we present a graph modeling framework – which we call HydroGraphs – for understanding pollutant transport and fate across waterbodies, rivers, and watersheds. This framework uses a simplified representation of hydrological systems that can be constructed based purely on open-source data (National Hydrography Dataset and Watershed Boundary Dataset). The graph representation provides a flexible intuitive approach for capturing connectivity and for identifying upstream pollutant sources and for tracing downstream impacts within small and large hydrological systems. Moreover, the graph representation can facilitate the use of advanced algorithms and tools of graph theory, topology, optimization, and machine learning to aid data analytics and decision-making. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework by using case studies in the State of Wisconsin; here, we aim to identify upstream nutrient pollutant sources that arise from agricultural practices and trace downstream impacts to waterbodies, rivers, and streams.

A specific object of this research is the implemented risk assessment and management system, part of the drinking water safety plan for Sofia city. The water supply system from the water source to the end user, operated by Sofiyska voda JSC and part of Veolia, was analyzed. The hazards and risk events were reviewed for each component of the system—the catchment, water source, supply water pipes, drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) and distribution water network. The results of the risk evaluation show that the risk of an algal bloom falls from medium risk, with a value of 36 in 2018. This risk was new for the Iskar Dam—the main water source for Sofia city. The purpose of the current study is to analyze the risk of blue-green algae blooming and the potential release of toxins in the Iskar Dam. A data analysis of phytoplankton counts, temperature of the water in the dam, precipitation, algal diversity and quantity of microcystins for a period of three years shows that there is a low probability of algae blooming. The concentration of microcystin LR was below 0.6 µg/L and of microcystin YR was below 0.1 µg/L. The highest phytoplankton count was 70,000 cells/mL in 2018, and it decreased to 30,000 cells/mL in 2020. The impact of the risk of “blue-green algae blooms in the Iskar Dam” is assessed as moderate (3) and that has not changed between 2018 and 2022. The likelihood of occurrence of this risk decreased from possible (3) to unlikely (2) after risk reassessment, and the current control effectiveness changed from weakly controlled (4) in 2018 to well controlled (2) in 2022, because more risk management actions were included in Sofiyska voda JSC. The results of the risk evaluation show that the risk of an algal bloom falls into the low-risk category with a value of 12, after measures were considered and a reassessment. As a preventive measure for better management and risk minimization, it is necessary to continue monitoring the phytoplankton count, species composition, concentration of algae toxins (microcystin LR) and nutrients in raw water from the Iskar Dam. This research has added value to the global database for surface water sources intended for human consumption and is focuses on a potential problem, valid for agricultural as well as for urban territories rich in diffused sources of pollution.

Taking preindustrial cropland expansion in France, Germany, and Italy as a case study, this study first adopted a productivity-based estimation of cropland per capita, which converted crop yield to cropland demand per capita through negative correlations under different crop rotations, to improve the accuracy of national cropland areas. Then, a new allocation algorithm was proposed to allocate national cropland areas into 5′× 5′ grids. The algorithm combines land suitability, which characterizes regional differentiation of potential productivity indicated by physiogeographic factors (climate, topography, soil, etc.) that dominate cultivation, and cultivation preference, which quantifies sociocultural impacts by kernel density estimation based on city information (i.e., location, size, accessibility). The cropland cover scenario here shows similar phases but different modes of cropland expansion in these countries: (1) National cropland areas increased 1.73–2.46 times during the 11th–13th centuries, manifested by the expanding cultivated ranges in France and Germany and the increasing cultivation intensity in Italy.

Therefore, the idea of this research was to carry out a multi-disciplinary study of carbon fluxes and pools in the sector of agriculture and land use – one of the main sources of GHG – in regions with humid continental climate that are the most affected by current climate change. Our work was aimed at solving the problem of quantifying GHG fluxes and carbon pools in crop and livestock production, analyzing the reasons for their formation and possible absorption pathways at three locations in the European part of Russia in the cold continental climate zone. The study examined both agricultural and natural ecosystems; field measurements, laboratory analyses, and simulation modelling techniques were applied. The sites included seven types of ecosystems: croplands, pastures, hayfields, fallows, forests, stockyards, and compost piles. Livestock facilities are potent sources of three main biogenic GHG (0.42 − 9.27 g C-CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1; 2.43 − 783.51 mg C-CH<inf>4</inf> m-2 h-1; 0.01 − 1.49 mg N-N<inf>2</inf>O m-2 h-1); whereas croplands, hayfields and forests can absorb methane (from −1.10 to −118.2 μg C-CH<inf>4</inf> m-2 h-1), as well as pastures, hayfields, fallows and forests are weak sinks of nitrous oxide (from −0.10 to −4.57 μg N-N<inf>2</inf>O m-2 h-1). Ecosystems were ranked using a non-parametric test by increasing rate of CO<inf>2</inf> emission from soil in the following order: croplands (0.06 − 0.24 g C-CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) ≤ hayfields (0.06 − 0.25 g C-CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) ≤ pastures (0.06 − 0.22 g C-CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) = fallows (0.13 − 0.26 g C-CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) = forests (0.16 − 0.30 g CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) ≤ stockyards (0.42 − 1.57 g CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1) < compost piles (1.95 − 9.27 g CO<inf>2</inf> m-2 h-1). According to the correlation analysis, the most important dynamic environmental factor on which the intensity of soil respiration depends is the soil temperature at the depth of 10 cm (r = 0.55 − 0.97, p < 0.05). As the regression analysis shows, hydrothermal and agrochemical controls explain the 46 − 89% variance of CO<inf>2</inf> emission from soil. The content of total carbon (1.31−7.95%) as well as of total nitrogen (0.12 − 0.62%) in soil follows a latitudinal pattern and increases from north to south regardless of the type of land use and farming intensity. The amount of carbon incorporated into the arable soil layer by root residues decreases in the following sequence: barley > winter wheat > spring wheat > oats > soybean from 402 to 198 kg C ha-1 yr-1. Field crop stubble is an additional source of soil carbon at 118 − 368 kg C ha-1 yr-1 in the following sequence: spring wheat > winter wheat > oats > soybean > barley. According to simulation modelling (DeNitrification-DeComposition model, DNDC; and Rothamsted Carbon model, RothC), accumulation of soil organic carbon is possible under winter wheat (270 kg C ha-1 yr-1), while under other crops its stocks decrease (from −190 to −423 kg C ha-1 yr-1). According to DNDC modelling, agrolandscapes are net sinks of carbon to a varying degree (at least 500 kg C ha-1 yr-1), with phytomass being the main pool of carbon sink, most of which is removed with yields. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The abstract describes a regional study based on field measurements.

However, they are of growing global concern due to climate change exacerbating their multiple impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems, carbon storage, human health, economies, and wider society. Temperate regions are predicted to be at greatest risk of increasing fire activity due to climate change, where fires can seriously impact important ecosystems for biodiversity and carbon storage, such as peatlands and forests. There is insufficient literature on the background prevalence, distribution, and drivers of fires in these regions, especially within Europe, to assess and mitigate their risks. Using a global database of fire patches based on the MODIS FireCCI51 product, we address this knowledge gap by quantifying the current prevalence and size of fires in Polesia, a 150,000 km2 area comprising a mosaic of peatland, forest, and agricultural habitats in northern Ukraine and southern Belarus. Between 2001 and 2019, fires burned 31,062 km2 of land, and were most frequent in spring and autumn. Although most fires started in agricultural land, fires disproportionately affected natural and semi-natural land cover types, particularly in protected areas. Over one fifth of protected land burned. Coniferous forests were the most common land cover type in protected areas, but fires mostly occurred in meadows, open peatlands (especially fen and transition mires), and native deciduous forests. These land cover types were highly susceptible to fires under low soil moisture conditions, but the risk of fire was low under average or higher soil moisture conditions.

Our result shows that birds usually increase woody, but not herbaceous, crop production, implying that crop loss mitigation efforts are critical for a better coexistence. We reveal that many nonlethal technical measures are more effective in reducing crop loss, e.g., using scaring devices and changing sow practices, than other available methods. Besides, we find that stakeholders from low-income countries are more likely to perceive the crop losses caused by birds and are less positive toward birds than those from high-income ones. Based on our evidence, we identified potential regional clusters, particularly in tropical areas, for implementing win-win coexistence strategies.

H08 is a global hydrological model that considers human water use and management (e.g., reservoir operation and crop irrigation). Although a crop growth sub-model has been included in H08 to estimate the global crop-specific calendar, its performance as a yield simulator is poor, mainly because a globally uniform parameter set was used for each crop type. In addition, the effects of CO2 fertilization and vapor pressure deficit on crop yield were not considered. Here, through country-wise parameter calibration and algorithm improvement, we enhanced H08 to simulate the yields of four major staple crops: maize, wheat, rice, and soybean. The simulated crop yield was compared with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) national yield statistics and the global dataset of historical yield for major crops (GDHY) gridded yield estimates with respect to mean bias (across nations) and time series correlation (for individual nations). Our results showed that the effects of CO2 fertilization and vapor pressure deficit had opposite impacts on crop yield. The simulated yield showed good consistency with FAO national yield. The mean biases of the major producer countries were considerably reduced to 2%, 2%, -2%, and -1% for maize, wheat, rice, and soybean, respectively. The capacity of our model to capture the interannual yield variability observed in FAO yield was limited, although the performance of our model was comparable to that of other mainstream global crop models. The grid-level analysis showed that our model showed a similar spatial pattern to that of the GDHY yield in terms of reproducing the temporal variation over a wide area, although substantial differences were observed in other places. Using the enhanced model, we quantified the contributions of irrigation to global food production and compared our results to an earlier study.

Recent studies (e.g., SVANN, spatial ensemble) targeting this difficult problem either require a known space-partitioning as the input, or can only support very limited number of partitions or classes (e.g., two) due to the decrease in training data size and the complexity of analysis. To address these limitations, we propose a model-agnostic framework to automatically transform a deep learning model into a spatial-heterogeneity-aware architecture, where the learning of arbitrary space partitionings is guided by a learning-engaged generalization of multivariate scan statistic and parameters are shared based on spatial relationships. Moreover, we propose a spatial moderator to generalize learned space partitionings to new test regions. Finally, we extend the framework by integrating meta-learning-based training strategies into both spatial transformation and moderation to enhance knowledge sharing and adaptation among different processes.

In most crop models, HI is set as a parameter; this empirical approach does not consider that HI not only depends on plant genotype, but is also affected by the environment. An alternative is to simulate allocation mechanistically, as in the LPJ-GUESS crop model, which simulates HI based on daily growing conditions and the crop development stage. Simulated HI is critical for agricultural research due to its economic importance, but it also can validate the robust representation of production processes. However, there is a challenge to constrain parameter values globally for the allocation processes. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the sensitivity of yield and HI of wheat and maize simulated with LPJ-GUESS to eight production allocation-related parameters and identify the most suitable parameter values for global simulations. The nitrogen demand reduction after anthesis, the minimum leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) and the range of leaf C:N strongly affected carbon assimilation and yield, while the retranslocation of labile stem carbon to grains and the retranslocation rate of nitrogen and carbon from vegetative organs to grains after anthesis mainly influenced HI. A global database of observed HI for both crops was compiled for reference to constrain simulations before calibrating parameters for yield against reference data. Two high- and low-yielding maize cultivars emerged from the calibration, whilst spring and winter cultivars were found appropriate for wheat. The calibrated version of LPJ-GUESS improved the simulation of yield and HI at the global scale for both crops, providing a basis for future studies exploring crop production under different climate and management scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",maybe,"The abstract mentions compiling a global database for reference, but it does not state if this compiled dataset is publicly available.",

Our study makes use of a global dataset on LSLTs for agricultural production to estimate potential carbon emissions based on different scenarios of land cover change and fertilizer use, as well as potential value of agricultural production on transacted land. We show that, if fully implemented on ∼ 38 M ha of transacted land, 2.51 GtC will be emitted during land conversion, with another 24.2 MtC/year emitted from fertilizer use, assuming farming technology of investors’ origin is adopted on transacted land. Comparison of different combinations of forest protection policies and agricultural intensification levels reveals that enforcing strict deforestation regulation while promoting fertilizer use rate improves the carbon efficiency of agricultural production. Additionally, positive spillovers of investors’ farming technology on existing arable lands of host countries can potentially double their crop yield. Our analyses thus suggest that fostering agricultural intensification and technology spillovers under strict regulation on land allocation to investors to protect forests would allow for boosting agricultural yield while minimizing carbon emissions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",maybe,"The abstract states the use of a 'global dataset on LSLTs' but does not name it or specify its availability, making it impossible to verify all criteria.",

The process of development of this dataset employed satellite products, solar radiation, harvested area, crop calendar, and production share by cropping season. Our evaluations were conducted at the country scale, province scale, and in reference to different climates based on the Köppen-Geiger climate classification. The index of agreement over Iran is approximately 0.79, and according to percentage bias, GDHY has a 1.6% error over Iran. The dataset was reliable at the sub-national level, over the western parts, and particularly in the mountainous region. In reference to the root mean square error (tons/ha), it showed the lowest performance in the humid part of Iran (Mazandaran, Gilan, and Golestan provinces). Drought analysis showed that the reference crop yield dataset over the study area is more consistent with SPI-12, although GDHY agrees with SPI-3. In contrast to drier years in recent years, the crop yield has increased. This positive trend can be justified by increasing the rate of fertilizer applications, better grazing, an overall improvement in farming technologies, and better farm management at the country scale.

Here we used a stochastic water balance framework to quantify the whole probability structure of the timing for soil moisture dropping from a higher level to a lower one. Based on this framework, we can theoretically examine the nonlinear relationship between the rapid decline rate of soil moisture and various hydrometeorological factors and identify possible flash drought risks caused by less rainfall (e.g., long dry spells), higher evapotranspiration (e.g., extreme heat waves), lower soil water storage capacity (e.g., deforestation), or a combination thereof. Applying this framework to the global datasets, we obtained global maps of the average time for drought development and the risks of flash drought.

The combined use of MT with/without straw mulching (SM) in current studies, however, limits us from understanding the relative contributions of certain conservation principles, and thus their potential for carbon accumulation. In this study, a synthesis was conducted based on a global database to explore the SOC accumulation potential by separating the relative importance of MT and SM. The results show that SM had a better performance in enhancing soil properties than MT, including decreasing soil bulk density (BD) as well as increasing SOC concentration down to deeper soil layers. Adopting SM, MT and the combination of SM and MT (SMMT) significantly promoted SOC sequestration in the 0–30 cm soil, but had no significant impact on SOC sequestration when deeper soil layers were considered. Nevertheless, the overall SOC sequestration rate under SM was over two times higher than MT, and especially, adopting SM could maintain SOC stock in the subsoil. Furthermore, we found that adoption of SMMT had positive impacts on SOC stock accumulations with increasing experimental duration, mean annual precipitation (MAP), and mean annual temperature (MAT) in the surface 0–5 cm soil. The results highlight that it is equally important to increase SOC sequestration in the surface soil and maintain SOC stock in the subsoil, which has been overlooked in current assessments.

In this paper, I describe a holistic approach that allows us to obtain such a bigger picture and use it to understand how the terrestrial biosphere can be sustained in the presence of increased human activity. This approach places particular emphasis on the free energy generated by photosynthesis—energy that is required to sustain both the dissipative metabolic activity of ecosystems and human activities (with the generation rate being restricted by the physical constraints of the environment). Thus, one can then identify two types of human influence on the biosphere and their resulting consequences: the detrimental effects caused by enhanced human consumption of this free energy and the beneficial effects that allow for more photosynthetic activity and, therefore, more dissipative activity within the biosphere. I use examples from the terrestrial biosphere to illustrate this view and global datasets to indicate how this can be quantified. Thereafter, I discuss how certain aspects of modern technology can enhance free energy generation within the terrestrial biosphere, which can, in turn, safeguard its sustenance even as human activity increasingly shapes the functioning of the Earth system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract states the use of 'global datasets' to quantify aspects of the terrestrial biosphere, which is relevant to agriculture and meets the criteria.",

Weather generators are often used to generate stochastic rainfall time series; however, no such model exists for the generation of a stochastically plausible PET time series. Here we develop a stochastic PET generator, stoPET, by leveraging a recently published global dataset of hourly PET at 0.1° resolution (hPET). stoPET is designed to simulate realistic time series of PET that capture the diurnal and seasonal variability in hPET and to support the simulation of various scenarios of climate change. The parsimonious model is based on a sine function fitted to the monthly average diurnal cycle of hPET, producing parameters that are then used to generate any number of synthetic series of randomised hourly PET for a specific climate scenario at any point of the global land surface between 55° N and 55° S. In addition to supporting a stochastic analysis of historical PET, stoPET also incorporates three methods to account for potential future changes in atmospheric evaporative demand to rising global temperature. These include (1) a user-defined percentage increase in annual PET, (2) a step change in PET based on a unit increase in temperature, and (3) the extrapolation of the historical trend in hPET into the future. We evaluated stoPET at a regional scale and at 12 locations spanning arid and humid climatic regions around the globe. stoPET generates PET distributions that are statistically similar to hPET and an independent PET dataset from CRU, thereby capturing their diurnal/seasonal dynamics, indicating that stoPET produces physically plausible diurnal and seasonal PET variability. We provide examples of how stoPET can generate large ensembles of PET for future climate scenario analysis in sectors like agriculture and water resources with minimal computational demand. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract describes the use and production of global datasets (hPET, CRU, stoPET) relevant to agriculture and climate.",hPET; CRU

To identify different plants and their related pests and avoid inconsistencies between such organizations, an agreed and shared classification is necessary. In this regard, the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) has been working on defining and maintaining a harmonized coding system (EPPO codes). EPPO codes are an easy way of referring to a specific organism by means of short 5 or 6 letter codes instead of long scientific names or ambiguous common names. EPPO codes are freely available in different formats through the EPPO Global Database platform and are implemented as a worldwide standard and used among scientists and experts in both industry and regulatory organizations. One of the large companies that adopted such codes is BASF, which uses them mainly in research and development to build their crop protection and seeds products. However, extracting the information is limited by fixed API calls or files that require additional processing steps. Facing these issues makes it difficult to use the available information flexibly, infer new data connections, or enrich it with external data sources. To overcome such limitations, BASF has developed an internal EPPO ontology to represent the list of codes provided by the EPPO Global Database as well as the regulatory categorization and relationship among them. This paper presents the development process of this ontology along with its enrichment process, which allows the reuse of relevant information available in an external knowledge source such as the NCBI Taxon.

Genome duplications are an important mechanism to enable plant adaptation. This leads to characteristic footprints in the genome, such as protein family expansion. We explore genetic diversity and uncover evolutionary adaptation to stresses by exploiting genome comparisons between stress tolerant and sensitive species and RNA-Seq data sets from stress experiments. Expanded gene families that are stress-responsive based on differential expression analysis could hint at species or clade-specific adaptation, making these gene families exciting candidates for follow-up tolerance studies and crop improvement. Software: Integration of such cross-species omics data is a challenging task, requiring various steps of transformation and filtering. Ultimately, visualization is crucial for quality control and interpretation. To address this, we developed A2TEA: Automated Assessment of Trait-specific Evolutionary Adaptations, a Snakemake workflow for detecting adaptation footprints in silico. It functions as a one-stop processing pipeline, integrating protein family, phylogeny, expression, and protein function analyses. The pipeline is accompanied by an R Shiny web application that allows exploring, highlighting, and exporting the results interactively. This allows the user to formulate hypotheses regarding the genomic adaptations of one or a subset of the investigated species to a given stress. Conclusions: While our research focus is on crops, the pipeline is entirely independent of the underlying species and can be used with any set of species.

This study investigates the contributions of different climatic and socio-economic variables to agricultural drought in Jharkhand. The three primary criteria, i.e., exposure (E), sensitivity (S), and adaptive capacity (AC), responsible for agricultural drought vulnerability, were examined to identify the drought-prone areas. Long-term (1958–2020) gridded climatic datasets obtained from the Terra-climate global dataset, MODIS vegetation index dataset (MOD13Q1) for the years 2001–2020, different soil parameters obtained from the ISRIC global soil database and state agricultural portal of Jharkhand, and different socio-economic datasets obtained from census data (2011) provided by Govt. of India, were utilized for this study. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to estimate the weighted contribution of the indicator variables falling under each criterion (E, S, and AC), and three criteria index maps were generated. These separate maps were further integrated to generate the final vulnerability index map. Finally, the study area was categorized into different zones based on the drought vulnerability index value ranging from 0 to 1, according to the severity of the drought. It was observed that about 4.05%, 28.12%, and 37.07% of the total geographical area is very highly, highly, and moderately vulnerable to agricultural drought, respectively.

The result shows four stages of changes in the total cropland area: steady increase during 1650–1830 stimulated by policies and population growth, decrease during 1830–1937 affected by wars and natural disasters, rapid growth during 1937–the 1980s, and rapid decrease after the 1980s influenced by urbanization and the agricultural planting structure adjustment. The total cropland area increased from 2.2 × 104 km2 in 1650 to 3.99 × 104 km2 in 2016. The majority of the cropland concentrated on the Guanzhong region from 1650 to 2016.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of imbalance in training data on the performance of a random forest model (RF). The original dataset (imbalanced) included 6100 soil texture data from the surface layer of agricultural fields in northern Iran. A synthetic resampling approach using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to make a balanced dataset from the original data. Bioclimatic and remotely sensed data, distance, and terrain attributes were used as environmental covariates to model and map soil textural classes. Results showed that based on mean minimal depth (MMD), when imbalanced data was used, distance and annual mean precipitation were important, but when balanced data were employed, terrain attributes and remotely sensed data played a key role in predicting soil texture. Balanced data also improved the accuracies from 44% to 59% and 0.30 to 0.52 with regard to the overall accuracy and kappa values, respectively.

Jonathan",2022,"Aim: Tree pests have major impacts in both natural and agricultural systems. Despite their ecological and economic importance, it is likely that pests go unreported in many regions. Using a global dataset of tree pests and multiple metrics of pest diversity standardized for host availability, we describe the biogeography of under-reporting and reveal potential for future pest invasions. Location: Global. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Pathogens, insect pests and native tree hosts. Methods: We assembled the global distributions of 3,828 tree pests and 2,689 host tree species across 226 countries, and calculated two metrics of pest diversity that account for host availability: pest saturation (i.e., the proportion of the known pests of native host trees present with countries) and pest deficit (the number of known pests of native trees that have not yet been reported in countries). We used Bayesian regression models to identify how sampling, socio-economic variables, climate and ecological drivers affect estimates of pest saturation and deficit. Results: We show that most countries are reported to have fewer than 50% of the pests for which native hosts are available—corresponding to hundreds of additional pest species per country. Pest saturation was lowest in Africa and central Asia, while pest deficit was highest in eastern Europe. Accounting for research output, pest saturation was higher in warmer and wetter countries, while pest deficit was highest in countries with greater host phylogenetic diversity. Low saturation and high deficit even in well-documented countries suggest a considerable potential for pest range expansion if barriers to dispersal are lowered.

Evaluating the reliability of existing global LUCC datasets is a precondition for improved data quality. In this study, based on the regional historical document-based reconstructions, satellite-based data, and historical reclamation evidence for the Xinjiang area of China, the accuracy and rationality of cropland data for this area in the HYDE 3.2 and SAGE datasets were evaluated by utilizing comparative analysis regarding three aspects, namely the change tendency of the cropland area, the area of cropland, and the differences in spatial pattern. This study concluded that the amount of cropland in the Xinjiang area in the global and regional datasets shows both disparate trends and large differences in absolute values. Spatially, historical reclamation evidence indicated that agricultural cultivation in the Xinjiang area underwent expansion from south to north and from east to west over the past 300 years; however, the global datasets revealed that the cropland spatial patterns in the Xinjiang area in the historical period are similar to those in the current period. These differences are attributable to the uncertainties of the basic assumptions, per capita cropland area estimates, and reconstruction methods in the global datasets.

Local decision makers therefore need reliable long-term hydro-meteorological forecasts to support the seasonal management of water resources, reservoir operations and agriculture. In this context, an Ensemble Kalman Filter framework is applied to predict sub-basin-scale runoff employing global freely available datasets of reanalysis precipitation (ERA5-Land) as well as bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated seasonal forecasts (SEAS5-BCSD). Runoff is estimated using least squares predictions, exploiting the covariance structures between runoff and precipitation. The performance of the assimilation framework was assessed using different ensemble skill scores. New hydrological insights for the region: Our results show that the quality of runoff predictions are closely linked to the performance of the rainfall seasonal predictions and allows skillful predictions up to two months ahead in most sub-basins. The anthropogenic conditions such as in the Western Bahia state, however, must be taken under consideration, since non-stationary runoff time-series have poorer skill as such unnatural variations can not be captured by long-term covariances. In sub-basins which are dominated by little anthropogenic influence, the presented framework provides a promising and easily transferable approach for skillful operational seasonal runoff predictions on sub-basin scale. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract states the use of 'global freely available datasets' (ERA5-Land, SEAS5-BCSD) for hydrological predictions relevant to agriculture.

We conducted year-long sampling of 59 sites in a nested-catchment design in the Mara River, Kenya in which fluxes were quantified and their underlying controls assessed. We estimated annual basin-scale greenhouse gas emissions from measured in-stream gas concentrations, modeled gas transfer velocities, and determined the sensitivity of up-scaling to discharge. Based on the total annual CO<inf>2</inf>-equivalent emissions calculated from global warming potentials (GWP), the Mara basin was a net greenhouse gas source (294 ± 35 Gg CO<inf>2</inf> eq yr−1). Lower-order streams (1–3) contributed 81% of the total fluxes, and higher stream orders (4–8) contributed 19%. Cropland-draining streams also exhibited higher fluxes compared to forested streams. Seasonality in stream discharge affected stream widths (and stream area) and gas exchange rates, strongly influencing the basin-wide annual flux, which was 10 times higher during the high and medium discharge periods than the low discharge period. The basin-wide estimate was underestimated by up to 36% if discharge was ignored, and up to 37% for lower stream orders. Future research should therefore include seasonality in stream surface areas in upscaling procedures to better constrain basin-wide fluxes.

In the context of tourism-driven economic potential areas, these drivers have greater effects, including threatening groundwater availability. This study assessed the combined impacts of climate and land use changes on the groundwater recharge (GWR) in Siem Reap, Cambodia utilizing Phase Six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) global climate models (GCMs), DynaCLUE land-use model, and Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Three climate models CanESM5, EC_Earth3, and MIROC6, out of seven, best captured the observed data after performance evaluation through the entropy method, were bias-corrected linearly for two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) - SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. The results indicate a general increase in precipitation under both SSPs, while the average annual maximum temperature is likely to increase by 0.024 °C/year and 0.049 °C/year under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. A similar trend but relatively higher increase is expected for the minimum temperature. Furthermore, the historical land use change showed the expansion of urban settlement by 373% between 2004 and 2019 at the expense of forest and shrubland. Future land use projections from the DynaCLUE model show that the urban settlements in the study area are likely to expand, from their 2019 condition, by 55% in 2030, 209% in 2060, and 369% in 2090 under SSP2 and at double of these rates under SSP5 scenario. The GWR is expected to rise by 39–53% during the wet season and decrease by 13–29% during the dry season under both scenarios. Meanwhile, under constant land use, the GWR is likely to increase more compared to other scenarios, highlighting the importance of land use planning to policymakers and planners.

However, the amount of carbon that can be potentially added to the soil is still being debated, and there is a lack of information on additional storage potential on global cropland. Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential is region-specific and conditioned by climate and management but most global estimates use fixed accumulation rates or time frames. In this study, we model SOC storage potential as a function of climate, land cover and soil. We used 83,416 SOC observations from global databases and developed a quantile regression neural network to quantify the SOC variation within soils with similar environmental characteristics. This allows us to identify similar areas that present higher SOC with the difference representing an additional storage potential. We estimated that the topsoils (0-30 cm) of global croplands (1,410 million hectares) hold 83 Pg C. The additional SOC storage potential in the topsoil of global croplands ranges from 29 to 65 Pg C. These values only equate to three to seven years of global emissions, potentially offsetting 35% of agriculture's 85 Pg historical carbon debt estimate due to conversion from natural ecosystems. As SOC store is temperature-dependent, this potential is likely to reduce by 14% by 2040 due to climate change in a ''business as usual'' scenario.

Using quantile regression, we found that countries with higher Human Development Indices (HDI) (including education, income, and lifespan), higher-income equality, lower food insecurity, and higher cereal yields had the most organic production and inputs. However, input-intensive strategies were associated with greater agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

Using a longitudinal analysis spanning 2004–2018, we found that countries were generally decreasing inputs and increasing their share of agriculture in organic production. Also, in disentangling correlation vs. causation, we hypothesize that a country's development is more likely to drive changes in agricultural strategies than vice versa. Altogether, our correlative analyses suggest that countries with greater progress toward the SDGs of no poverty, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, decent work, economic growth, and reduced inequalities had the highest production of organic agriculture and, to a lesser extent, intensive use of inputs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The abstract mentions leveraging 'global databases covering 121 countries' to study agricultural sustainability.

Machine learning algorithms (XGboost) and feature importance analysis showed that the amount and intensity of rainfall explained the most variability in NO3 leaching (up to 24 kg N ha-1), followed by nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate and crop N removal. In contrast, other soil and management variables such as soil texture, crop type, tillage and N source, timing and placement had less importance.

Three issues commonly arise. First, focusing primarily on core development accessions may mean that the potential contributions of landraces or other secondary accessions may be overlooked. Second, elite cultivars may accumulate deleterious alleles away from nontarget loci due to the strong effects of artificial selection. Finally, a tendency to focus solely on SNP-based methods may cause incomplete or erroneous identification of functional variants. In practice, integration of local breeding programs with findings from global database projects may be challenging. First, local GWAS experiments may only indicate useful functional variants according to the diversity of the experimental panel, while other potentially useful loci—identifiable at a global level—may remain undiscovered. Second, large-scale experiments such as GWAS may prove prohibitively costly or logistically challenging for some agencies. Here, we present a fully automated bioinformatics pipeline (riceExplorer) that can easily integrate local breeding program sequence data with international database resources, without relying on any phenotypic experimental procedure.

Results highlight the effectiveness of our pipeline, identifying potentially useful functional haplotypes across the genome that are absent from elite cultivars and found among landraces and other secondary varieties in our breeding program. riceExplorer can automatically conduct a full genome analysis and produces annotated graphical output of chromosomal maps, potential global diversity sources, and summary tables. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract explicitly describes integrating local data with a 'global crop database (IRRI 3000 Rice Genomes)'.

Numerous experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of CA under various local conditions, and meta-analysis has become a standard approach in agricultural sector for analysing and summarizing the experimental data. Meta-analysis provides valuable synthetic information based on mean effect size estimation. However, summarizing large amounts of information by way of a single mean effect value is not always satisfactory, especially when considering agricultural practices. Indeed, their impacts on crop yields are often non-linear, and vary widely depending on a number of factors, including soil properties and local climate conditions. To address this issue, here we present a machine learning approach to produce data-driven global maps describing the spatial distribution of the productivity of CA versus conventional tillage (CT). Our objective is to evaluate and compare several machine-learning models for their ability in estimating the productivity of CA systems, and to analyse uncertainty in the model outputs. We consider different usages, including classification, point regression and quantile regression. Our approach covers the comparison of 12 different machine learning algorithms, model training, tuning with cross-validation, testing, and global projection of results. The performances of these algorithms are compared based on a recent global dataset including more than 4,000 pairs of crop yield data for CA vs. CT. We show that random forest has the best performance in classification and regression, while quantile regression forest performs better than quantile neural networks in quantile regression. The best algorithms are used to map crop productivity of CA vs. CT at the global scale, and results reveal that the performance of CA vs. CT is characterized by a strong spatial variability, and that the probability of yield gain with CA is highly dependent on geographical locations.

Evaluating the potential socio-economic impact of GLOFs is essential for risk mitigation and enhancing community resilience. Yet in most of the cases, this is confronted with the challenges of limited availability of data and inaccessibility to most of the glacial lakes in the high-altitude areas. This study aims to exploit open data from different sources and high-performance hydrodynamic modelling to develop a new framework for GLOF exposure and impact assessment. In the new framework, different GLOF scenarios are created using a simple dam breach model. A high-performance hydrodynamic model is then adopted to simulate the resulting flood hydrodynamics. Necessary socio-economic information is collected and processed from multiple sources including OpenStreetMap, Google Earth, and global data products to support exposure analysis. Established depth-damage curves are used to assess the GLOF damage extents to different exposed objects and an existing fatality estimating procedure is adopted to assess the potential loss of lives. The evaluation framework is applied to the Tsho Rolpa glacial lake in Nepal. From the results, the worst GLOF scenario as considered can potentially inundate 1647 buildings, impact 5038 people and hit 123 key facilities including schools, hospitals, airports, hydropower plants, etc. It may substantially damage 900 buildings, 10.63 km2 of agricultural land and 50.9 km roads and may potentially lead to 45 deaths even if warning is available. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract describes using open and global data sources, including 'OpenStreetMap', 'Google Earth', and 'global data products', to assess flood impacts on various objects, including 'agricultural land'.

Yet, the water balance of cultivated areas is strongly influenced by applied management practices (e.g. planting, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting). The SWAT+ (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model represents agricultural land by default in a generic way, where the start of the cropping season is driven by accumulated heat units. However, this approach does not work for tropical and subtropical regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where crop growth dynamics are mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature. In this study, we present an approach on how to incorporate crop phenology using decision tables and global datasets of rainfed and irrigated croplands with the associated cropping calendar and fertilizer applications in a regional SWAT+ model for northeastern Africa. We evaluate the influence of the crop phenology representation on simulations of leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ET) using LAI remote sensing data from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and WaPOR (Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data) ET data, respectively. Results show that a representation of crop phenology using global datasets leads to improved temporal patterns of LAI and ET simulations, especially for regions with a single cropping cycle. However, for regions with multiple cropping seasons, global phenology datasets need to be complemented with local data or remote sensing data to capture additional cropping seasons. In addition, the improvement of the cropping season also helps to improve soil erosion estimates, as the timing of crop cover controls erosion rates in the model. With more realistic growing seasons, soil erosion is largely reduced for most agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs), which can be considered as a move towards substantial improvements over previous estimates. We conclude that regional and global hydrological models can benefit from improved representations of crop phenology and the associated management practices. Future work regarding the incorporation of multiple cropping seasons in global phenology data is needed to better represent cropping cycles in areas where they occur using regional to global hydrological models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The abstract describes incorporating 'global datasets of rainfed and irrigated croplands' as well as data from 'Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS)' and 'WaPOR' into a regional agricultural model.

Machine learning (ML) models using these spectra can be calibrated, adding only samples from one field or gathering different areas to augment the data inserted and enhance the models’ accuracy. Robustness assessment of prediction models usually rely on statistical metrics. However, how the spatial distribution of predicted soil attributes can be affected is still little explored, despite the fact that agriculture productive decisions depend on the spatial variability of these attributes. The objective of this study was to use online NIR spectra to predict soil attributes at field level, evaluating the statistical metrics and also the spatial distribution observed in prediction to compare a local prediction model with models that gathered samples from other areas. A total of 383 online NIR spectra were acquired in an experimental field to predict clay, sand, organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). To build ML calibrations, 72 soil spectra from the experimental field (local dataset) were gathered, with 59 samples from another area nearby, in the same geological region (geological dataset) and with this area nearby and more 60 samples from another area in a different region (global dataset). Principal components regression was performed using k-fold (k=10) cross-validation. Clay models reported similar errors of prediction, and although the local model presented a lower R2 (0.17), the spatial distribution of prediction proved that the models had similar performance. Although OM patterns were comparable between the three datasets, local prediction, with the lower R2 (0.75), was the best fitted. However, for secondary NIR response attributes, only CEC could be successfully predicted and only using local dataset, since the statistical metrics were compatible, but the geological and global models misrepresented the spatial patterns in the field. Agronomic plausibility of spatial distribution proved to be a key factor for the evaluation of soil attributes prediction at field level. Results suggest that local calibrations are the best recommendation for diffuse reflectance spectroscopy NIR prediction of soil attributes and that statistical metrics alone can mispresent the accuracy of prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study focuses on field-level prediction.

Plant diseases not only reduce the agricultural yield but also reduce the quality of the produce. Thus, tackling plant diseases at an early stage becomes crucial. This becomes a difficult task if done manually as tracking large farmlands is not easy. In this paper, we present an approach for detecting plant diseases. One of the datasets used in this work is the most popularly available dataset, Plant Village. Since the dataset is imbalanced, generative adversarial network (GAN) has been used to generate synthetic minority class images for balancing the dataset. Most of the existing works have only used the Plant Village dataset for training and testing, which makes these trained models unfit for plant images in uncontrolled conditions. Thus, Plant Doc, a real-world dataset, has also been used. Transfer learning has been used in our proposed system for training the CNN models to detect diseases. Segmentation and object detection methods have been employed to identify individual plant leaves from images containing multiple leaves and complex backgrounds, thus facilitating the model to work on real-world images. Each prominently visible leaf was segmented and the disease and severity predictions have been made on the masked image.

In large-scale experiments, however, UAV images suffer from containing a multitudinous amount of crops in a complex canopy architecture. Especially for the observation of temporal effects, this complicates the recognition of individual plants over several images and the extraction of relevant information tremendously. Results: In this work, we present a hands-on workflow for the automatized temporal and spatial identification and individualization of crop images from UAVs abbreviated as ""cataloging""based on comprehensible computer vision methods. We evaluate the workflow on 2 real-world datasets. One dataset is recorded for observation of Cercospora leaf spot - a fungal disease - in sugar beet over an entire growing cycle. The other one deals with harvest prediction of cauliflower plants. The plant catalog is utilized for the extraction of single plant images seen over multiple time points. This gathers a large-scale spatiotemporal image dataset that in turn can be applied to train further machine learning models including various data layers. Conclusion: The presented approach improves analysis and interpretation of UAV data in agriculture significantly.

To investigate this question this paper uses a standard Input-Output modeling framework and data from 141 countries and regions to construct a new global dataset of employment, value-added, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (disaggregated into CO2 and Non-CO2 elements), and air pollution (including nine categories of air pollutants such as PM2.5) multipliers from supply side investments. We find that many of the traditional sectors in agriculture and industry have large employment multipliers, but also generate male dominant, lower skill employment, and tend to have higher emission multipliers. It is in economies dominated by these sectors that trade-offs to a 'greener' transition will emerge most sharply. However, we find a substantial heterogeneity in outcomes, so even in these economies, there exist other sectors with high employment multipliers and low emissions, including sectors that are more conducive to female employment. In addition, we find a high correlation between industries that generate GHG emissions, which cause long term climate impacts, and those that generate air pollution, which have immediate harmful impacts on human health, suggesting that policies could be designed to simultaneously confer longer climate benefits with immediate health improvements.

Sensor data and captured images of surveillance cameras are the results of IoT devices sensing capability. However, the originality of the data being stored is questioned; even worse, the data records are deleted. Such as problems occur due to several things: network congestion, device reliability, storage media, and operator.

The common understanding is that increased on-farm IE leads to an increase in water availability at the basin. However, in the recent past, many instances have been reported where increasing on-farm IE failed to increase water availability at the basin scale. This phenomenon is commonly known as the ‘Irrigation Efficiency Paradox (IEP)’. In this paper, we present a dynamic systems model of the IEP. Our model combines a simple mass-balance description of the water flows with the rent-seeking behavior of consumers. Through the socio-hydrological model, we arrive at a parametric characterization of the IEP, which is given by three attributes: the maximum short-term benefit enjoyed after improvement in IE, the time duration after which the paradox occurs, and the escalation of the paradox once it occurs. We find that the paradox in basins with lower evaporation and higher recharge is more pronounced, the policy implications of which are in contrast to the common narrative that seeks to reduce evaporation and increase recharge. We also use our findings along with global data sets to identify regions that are most susceptible to the IEP. We argue that much caution must be practiced while introducing efficient irrigation technologies in the identified regions so as to avoid paradoxical effects to as much extent as possible.

Using a global dataset, we tested whether shifts occurred in the invader Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), which has undergone intercontinental spread as well as habitat-switching within its invaded range in North America. Climate space ordination showed that North America is, on average, colder than Afro-Eurasia, and North American Johnsongrass occupies wetter environments than in its native range.

Soil erosion rates in Nordic countries are lower than the global average, but they are exacerbating in several locations (especially western Norway). The integration of the land cover datasets with maps of forest harvest areas shows that the majority of the losses in forest cover due to forestry operations are largely undetected, but a non-negligible share of the forest-to-agriculture (up to 19%) or forest-to-grassland (up to 51%) transitions overlap with the harvested sites. Forestry activity in the study region primarily involves small-scale harvest events that are difficult to be detected at the 300 m resolution of the land cover dataset. An accurate representation of forest management remains a challenge for global datasets of land cover time series, and more interdisciplinary international efforts are needed to address this gap. Overall, this analysis provides a detailed overview of recent changes in land cover and forest management in Nordic countries as represented by state-of-the-art global datasets, and offers insights to future studies aiming to improve these data or apply them in land surface models, climate models, landscape ecology, or other applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract mentions using global datasets from the European Space Agency and Copernicus to study land cover changes, which are relevant to agriculture.",

Known as the Ramgarh (impact) structure, this landform was first noticed in 1869. Although the possibility of its meteorite impact origin was mentioned as early as 1972, it was described as a tectonic “dome structure,” in the absence of any clinching evidence. Geological and geophysical investigations carried out during the last decades have pointed out features typical of a terrestrial meteorite impact, such as a well-preserved circular shape with an uplifted central depression, steep inner slopes of the ridge compared to outer slopes, intense brecciation, fracturing, and faulting, and most important, identification of planar deformation features in quartz, diagnostic of shock metamorphism. Therefore, the structure has recently been recognized as a confirmed “meteorite impact structure” from India and listed in the global database on impact structures. The central depression of the structure is also the site for a tenth century Khajuraho-style temple complex. Besides, there are two cave temples on the inner slope of the eastern rim of the structure, a cultural cum pilgrimage center. The ruins of a fort at the southern outer slope of the structure represent yet another object of archeological/historic interest. The two water bodies in the central depression, filled with the rainwater drained from the surrounding slopes, are the abode for several species of migratory birds. Thus, the “impact structure” provides scientific, archeological, historical, cultural, and biodiversity features of common interest in a unified geographic domain, making an appropriate case for consideration and accreditation as “geopark.” Although the structure is listed amongst 34 geoheritage sites/geological monuments by the Geological Survey of India, the efforts have not been translated into any action on the ground in terms of developing it as a geopark. In this contribution, we provide geological and geomorphological characteristics of this structure, and in conjunction with the other wide-ranging aspects, propose recognition of this well-preserved “meteorite impact structure” as a “geoheritage site/geopark.” © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,The paper's focus is on geology and geoheritage.

Recent methodological proposals for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), evaluate water use impacts on freshwater habitats based on river hydraulic parameters alterations. However, they are limited to French rivers due to lack of global data and models. On this basis, this article proposes an approach to compute regionalized characterization factors for modeling river habitat change potential (HCP) induced by water consumption, potentially applicable worldwide. A simplified model is developed for fish guilds and invertebrates. Based on French datasets, it establishes a relationship between HCP and river hydraulic parameters. A methodology to derive discharge and hydraulic geometry at the reach scale is proposed and applied to European and Middle Eastern rivers below 60°N latitude. Regionalized HCPs are calculated at the river reach scale and aggregated at watershed. Then, the impact of agricultural water use in contrasted European and Middle Eastern countries is evaluated comparing the outcomes from the HCP and the Available Water Remaining (AWARE) models at the national scale, considering water supply mix data. The same analysis is carried out on selected river basins. Finally, result consistency, uncertainty and global applicability of the overall approach are discussed. The study demonstrates the reproducibility of the impact model developed for French rivers on any hydrographic network where comparable ecological, hydrological and hydraulic conditions are met. Furthermore, it highlights the need to characterize impacts at a higher spatial resolution in areas where HCP is higher. Large scale quantification of HCP opens the way to the operationalization of mechanistic LCIA models in which the habitat preferences of freshwater species are taken into account to assess the impacts of water consumption on biodiversity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The abstract states that the study is limited by a 'lack of global data' and uses regional datasets (French, European, Middle Eastern), which does not meet the global coverage criterion.",

In most part of the research, the environment is assumed to be static, while the dynamic parts of the environment degrade the estimation quality of SLAM algorithms and lead to inherently fragile systems. To enhance the performance and robustness of the SLAM in dynamic environments (SLAMIDE), a novel cooperative approach named parallel-map (p-map) SLAM is introduced in this paper. The objective of the proposed method is to deal with the dynamics of the environment, by detecting dynamic parts and preventing the inclusion of them in SLAM estimations. In this approach, each robot builds a limited map in its own vicinity, while the global map is built through a hybrid centralized MRSLAM. The restricted size of the local maps, bounds computational complexity and resources needed to handle a large scale dynamic environment. Using a probabilistic index, the proposed method differentiates between stationary and moving landmarks, based on their relative positions with other parts of the environment. Stationary landmarks are then used to refine a consistent map. The proposed method is evaluated with different levels of dynamism and for each level, the performance is measured in terms of accuracy, robustness, and hardware resources needed to be implemented. The method is also evaluated with a publicly available real-world data-set. Experimental validation along with simulations indicate that the proposed method is able to perform consistent SLAM in a dynamic environment, suggesting its feasibility for MRSLAM applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,The paper is about robotics (SLAM) and the abstract does not indicate any relation to agriculture or closely related fields.,

Methods for measuring this impact have been under development for over a decade, with the Available Water Remaining (AWARE) method being the current consensus approach. Available characterisation factors rely on global databases, which are built from potentially inappropriate information. This analysis aims to develop AWARE factors specific to Australian basins using the most recent meteorological data and water consumption statistics available. Australian cotton cropping is used as a case study in the application of the newly developed characterisation factors, and a cotton-specific characterisation factor is developed. Methods: The analysis involved the compilation of meteorological data quantifying water run-off and statistical data on domestic, industrial and agricultural water consumption. A geographical information system (GIS) software was used to map the information at the Australian basin level. The information was used to develop a set of monthly and annual characterisation factors for each basin and at the country level, using the AWARE method. All underpinning information is available in a public repository. A cotton-specific AWARE factor was calculated based on land cropped and average irrigation requirements over the past 10 years. Results and discussion: Comparing the data collected for this analysis with the data underpinning the current AWARE factors revealed some significant disparities. Using up-to-date statistics suggests that irrigation water requirements are 72% lower than the value currently used in AWARE, and that the characterisation factor for Australia should be up to 35% lower than currently reported. Basin definition was reviewed to align with the Life Cycle Inventory work conducted in Australia as part of AusLCI, so that characterisation factors correspond to the elementary flows defined in the Australian database of inventories. The new breakdown provides more granularity in the Murray-Darling division, where two-thirds of Australian irrigation water is consumed. Using the updated data to develop a factor for cotton shows a 20% reduction against using the current factors. Conclusions: The use of up-to-date water availability and consumption data for Australia would increase the robustness of the current AWARE impact assessment method for the region. All collected information was compiled to be easily updated for future iteration. The factors could be integrated in the global database of AWARE factors, though there may be inherent complexities in this process due to the variations in the geographical definitions of basins. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract discusses the AWARE method, which relies on global databases, and applies it to Australian agriculture, thus using data with a global context.",

The recent revolution in big data and Internet-of-Things (IoT) provides unprecedented benefits including optimizing yield, minimizing environmental impact, and reducing cost. However, the mass collection of farm data in IoT applications raises serious concerns about potential privacy leakage that may harm the farmers' welfare. In this work, we propose a novel scalable and private geo-distance evaluation system, called SPRIDE, to allow application servers to provide geographic-based services by computing the distances among sensors and farms privately. The servers determine the distances without learning any additional information about their locations. The key idea of SPRIDE is to perform efficient distance measurement and distance comparison on encrypted locations over a sphere by leveraging a homomorphic cryptosystem. To serve a large user base, we further propose SPRIDE+ with novel and practical performance enhancements based on pre-computation of cryptographic elements. Through extensive experiments using real-world datasets, we show SPRIDE+ achieves private distance evaluation on a large network of farms, attaining 3+ times runtime performance improvement over existing techniques.

Indeed, human-altered land uses favour species able to tolerate greater temperature and precipitation extremes. However, environmental changes do not impact species uniformly across their distributions, and most research exploring the impacts of climatic changes driven by land use has not considered potential within-range variation. We explored whether a population's climatic position (the difference between species' thermal and precipitation tolerance limits and the environmental conditions a population experiences) influences their relative abundance across land-use types. Location: Global. Methods: Using a global dataset of terrestrial vertebrate species and estimating their realized climatic tolerance limits, we analysed how the abundance of species within human-altered habitats relative to that in natural habitats varied across different climatic positions (controlling for proximity to geographic range edge). Results: A population's thermal position strongly influenced abundance within human-altered land uses (e.g. agriculture). Where temperature extremes were closer to species' thermal limits, population abundances were lower in human-altered land uses (relative to natural habitat) compared to areas further from these limits. These effects were generally stronger at tropical compared to temperate latitudes. In contrast, the influences of precipitation position were more complex and often differed between land uses and geographic zones. Mapping the outcome of models revealed strong spatial variation in the potential severity of decline for vertebrate populations following conversion from natural habitat to cropland or pasture, due to their climatic position. Main conclusions: We highlight within-range variation in species' responses to land use, driven (at least partly), by differences in climatic position. Accounting for spatial variation in responses to environmental changes is critical when predicting population vulnerability, producing successful conservation plans, and exploring how biodiversity may be impacted by future land-use and climate change interactions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract explicitly states the use of a 'global dataset' to analyze species' responses to land-use changes, including agriculture.",

Here, using a global dataset of 33,750 recipes from 70 cuisines containing 93 different spices, we demonstrate that variation in spice use is not explained by temperature and that spice use cannot be accounted for by diversity of cultures, plants, crops or naturally occurring spices. Patterns of spice use are not consistent with an infection-mitigation mechanism, but are part of a broader association between spice, health, and poverty.

Over-fertilization can have negative influences on the field and the regional level (e.g., agro-ecosys-tems). Remote sensing of the plant N of field crops presents a valuable tool for the monitoring of N flows in agro-ecosystems. Available data for validation of satellite-based remote sensing of N is scarce. Therefore, in this study, field spectrometer measurements were used to simulate data of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites developed for vegetation monitoring by the ESA. The prediction performance of normalized ratio indices (NRIs), random forest regression (RFR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for plant-N-related traits was assessed on a diverse real-world dataset including multiple crops, field sites and years. The plant N traits included the mass-based N measure, N concentration in the biomass (Nconc), and an area-based N measure approximating the plant N uptake (NUP). Spectral indices such as normalized ratio indices (NRIs) performed well, but the RFR and GPR methods outperformed the NRIs. Key spectral bands for each trait were identified using the RFR variable importance measure and the Gaussian processes regression band analysis tool (GPR-BAT), highlighting the importance of the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region for estimation of plant Nconc—and to a lesser extent the NUP. The red edge (RE) region was also important. The GPR-BAT showed that five bands were sufficient for plant N trait and leaf area index (LAI) estimation and that a surplus of bands effectively reduced prediction performance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed on all traits simultaneously, showing the dominance of the LAI in the mixed remote sensing signal. To delineate the plant-N-related traits from this signal, regional and/or national data collection campaigns producing large crop spectral libraries (CSL) are needed.

Among all the organisms that are beneficial to humans, plants stand out as the most important providers of natural resources. Therefore, identifying plant uses is critical to preserve the beneficial potential of biodiversity and to promote basic and applied research on the relationship between plants and humans. However, much of this information is often uncritical, contradictory, of dubious value or simply not readily accessible to the great majority of scientists and policy makers. Here, we compiled a genus-level dataset of plant-use records for all accepted vascular plant taxa (13489 genera) using the information gathered in the 4th Edition of Mabberley’s plant-book, the most comprehensive global review of plant classification and their uses published to date.

The research modeling was constructed based on some global datasets and factors (i.e., elevation, slope, soil, land use, land cover, agriculture, precipitation, river and road networks, and settlement sprawl) to evaluate greenbelt suitability. Spatial modeling revealed the highest greenbelt suitability (with SI values above 0.8) for the hinterlands of eight cities, including Hamadan, Zanjan, Sanandaj, Rasht, Sari, Gorgan, Qazvin, and Kermanshah.

To provide these, regional atmospheric models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, need to be optimized in their physical setup to the region of interest. The objective of this study is to evaluate four cumulus physics (CU), two microphysics (MP), two planetary boundary layer physics (PBL), and two radiation physics (RA) schemes in WRF according to their performance in dynamically downscaling the precipitation over two typical South American regions: one orographically complex area in Ecuador/Peru (horizontal resolution up to 9 and 3 km), and one area of rolling hills in Northeast Brazil (up to 9 km). For this, an extensive ensemble of 32 simulations over two continuous years was conducted. Including the reference uncertainty of three high-resolution global datasets (CHIRPS, MSWEP, ERA5-Land), we show that different parameterization setups can produce up to four times the monthly reference precipitation. This underscores the urgent need to conduct parameterization sensitivity studies before weather forecasts or input for impact modeling can be produced. Contrarily to usual studies, we focus on distributional, temporal and spatial precipitation patterns and evaluate these in an ensemble-tailored approach. These ensemble characteristics such as ensemble Structure-, Amplitude-, and Location-error, allow us to generalize the impacts of combining one parameterization scheme with others. We find that varying the CU and RA schemes stronger affects the WRF performance than varying the MP or PBL schemes. This effect is even present in the convection-resolving 3-km-domain over Ecuador/Peru where CU schemes are only used in the parent domain of the one-way nesting approach. The G3D CU physics ensemble best represents the CHIRPS probability distribution in the 9-km-domains. However, spatial and temporal patterns of CHIRPS are best captured by Tiedtke or BMJ CU schemes.

Therefore, our aim was to provide projections of future soil microbial distribution using several scenarios of global change. Location: Global. Time period: 1950–2090. Major taxa studied: Bacteria and fungi. Methods: We used a global database of soil microbial communities across six continents to estimate past and future trends of the soil microbiome. To do so, we used structural equation models to include the direct and indirect effects of changes in climate and land use in our predictions, using current climate (temperature and precipitation) and land-use projections between 1950 and 2090. Results: Local bacterial richness will increase in all scenarios of change in climate and land use considered, although this increase will be followed by a generalized community homogenization process affecting > 85% of terrestrial ecosystems. Changes in the relative abundance of functional genes associated with the increases in bacterial richness are also expected. Based on an ecological cluster analysis, our results suggest that phylotypes such as Geodermatophilus spp. (typical desert bacteria), Mycobacterium sp.

We find that 64% of global agricultural land (approximately 24.5 million km2) is at risk of pesticide pollution by more than one active ingredient, and 31% is at high risk. Among the high-risk areas, about 34% are in high-biodiversity regions, 5% in water-scarce areas and 19% in low- and lower-middle-income nations. We identify watersheds in South Africa, China, India, Australia and Argentina as high-concern regions because they have high pesticide pollution risk, bear high biodiversity and suffer from water scarcity. Our study expands earlier pesticide risk assessments as it accounts for multiple active ingredients and integrates risks in different environmental compartments at a global scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract describes using 'a global database of pesticide applications' to assess risk on agricultural land, which fits all criteria.",

Drought monitoring is essential for decision-makers seeking to minimize the socio-economic impacts related to drought events. In this study, we propose a methodology to identify the most suitable drought indices and data sources for monitoring the impact of drought on crops. Mozambique is used as a case study, as it represents a challenging example because of its poor hydroclimatic monitoring network and a lack of disaggregated data for agricultural production. A total of seven standardized drought indicators (SPI, SPEI, SSI, SVCI, STCI, SVHI, and STWS) at different scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) were obtained from global databases and evaluated as possible predictors of the annual variability of agricultural yields at the national level. A statistical model of crop yields based on time series was used to measure the explanatory capacity of each index. SPEI and SSI were the most effective at detecting the country's historical drought records regardless of whether nationally averaged values or the percentages of area affected by drought (PAA) were used. However, PAA was found to be a more accurate predictor of variability in crop yields. The variability of most cereals (maize, millet and sorghum) was adequately explained by the PAA of SPEI-3, with that of other crops (cashew nuts, cassava, potatoes, tea, tobacco and vegetables) being explained by the PAA of SSI-12. Specific indicators were proposed for monitoring wheat and sugar cane. These results can directly support managers and decision makers in developing drought contingency plans in Mozambique. To further demonstrate the potential of this methodology, it should be tested in other regions with a greater availability of agricultural data, including spatial disaggregation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract states that drought indicators were 'obtained from global databases' to study crop yield variability, meeting all criteria.",

It aimed at detecting cassava diseases using 5 fine-grained cassava leaf disease categories with 10,000, labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Traditionally, this detection is done mostly through physical inspection and supervision of cassava plants in the garden by farmers or agricultural extension workers from NAADS (National Agricultural Advisory Services) and then reported to NARO (National Agricultural Advisory Services) for further analysis. However, this can be tiresome, capital intensive, and lacks the ability to detect cassava infection timely to help farmers apply preventive techniques to the non-infected cassava plants in order to improve on yields which subsequently increases African food basket leading to food security which fights famine. Using the dataset provided to train CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to achieve high accuracy was very challenging due to two reasons: the dataset was small in size and has high-class imbalance being heavily biased towards CMD (Cassava Mosaic Disease) and CBB (Cassava Brown Streak Virus Disease) classes. Class imbalance is problematic in machine learning and exists in many domains. Note that, not all world data is balanced, in fact, most of the time you will not be extremely lucky to get a perfectly balanced real-world dataset, in recent years, a lot of research has been done for two-class problems such as fraudulent credit card and tumor detection among others. Interestingly, class imbalance in multi-class image datasets has received little attention. This paper, therefore, focused on techniques to achieve an accuracy score of over 93% with class weight, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and focal loss with deep convolutional neural networks from scratch.

In this context, validation of the global data set is of substance. Remote sensing measurements which are representative of an area covering 100 m2 to tens of km2 rarely match with in situ SM measurements at point scale due to scale difference. In this paper we present the new Indian Cosmic Ray Network (ICON) and compare it’s data with remotely sensed SM at different depths. ICON is the first network in India of the kind. It is operational since 2016 and consist of seven sites equipped with the COSMOS instrument. This instrument is based on the Cosmic Ray Neutron Probe (CRNP) technique which uses non-invasive neutron counts as a measure of soil moisture. It provides in situ measurements over an area with a radius of 150–250 m. This intermediate scale soil moisture is of interest for the validation of satellite SM. We compare the COSMOS derived soil moisture to surface soil moisture (SSM) and root zone soil moisture (RZSM) derived from SMOS, SMAP and GLDAS_Noah. The comparison with surface soil moisture products yield that the SMAP_L4_SSM showed best performance over all the sites with correlation (R) values ranging from 0.76 to 0.90.

Here we propose a model-based approach, using both global datasets and local data to build an evaluation of the potential impact of climate changes and population growth, as well as to verify the efficiency of mitigation measures to curb river water pollution. The upper Awash River catchment in Ethiopia, which drains the city of Addis Ababa as well as many agricultural areas, is used as a case-study. The results show that while decreases in runoff and increases in temperature due to climate change are expected to result in slightly decreased nutrient concentrations, the largest threat to the water quality of the Awash River is population growth, which is expected to increase nutrient loads by 15 to 20% (nitrate) and 30 to 40% (phosphorus) in the river by the second half of the 21st century.

Unfortunately, most of the ecological local studies are limited to the use of global data with coarse spatial resolutions, while fine-grain climate data are necessary to capture environmental variability and perform reliable modelling. We propose a high-resolution dataset (40 m grid) of the suite of original coarse-grain bioclimatic variables proposed by WorldClim 2 for the island of Sardinia (Italy); variations amongst our dataset and WorldClim 2 were calculated and mapped to show the spatial distribution of differences between all pairs of variables.

In order to explicitly quantify spatio-temporal variations in water availability, a process-based eco-hydrology model, NICE (National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology), was applied to two contrasting river basins: the Tuul River, which is characteristic of northern grassland and steppe, and the Galba River, characteristic of the southern Gobi Desert. The authors built a high-resolution data grid representing water use for livestock, urban populations, and mining in the entire basins by combining a global dataset, statistical data, GIS data, observation data, and field surveys to improve the accuracy of the model results. The model simulated the effects of past climatic change and human-induced disturbances such as urbanization and mining on water resources during 1980–2018 in these two river basins. The model results showed a clear difference in the hydrologic cycle between them, suggesting the impact of urbanization and mining on local-regional eco-hydrological degradation. Although drinking by herders’ livestock had some impact on the hydrologic change, the groundwater level in the Tuul River was shown to have been extremely degraded by water use in Ulaanbaatar over the last few decades whereas that in the Galba River has declined markedly as a result of Oyu Tolgoi mining since 2010. Analysis of the relative contribution of environmental factors also helped us to separate the effects of climatic change and human activities on spatio-temporal change in the groundwater level. These results clarified the large impact of water use due to urbanization and mining on groundwater degradation around the water sources, in addition to climatic change.

Prior studies mainly exploit autoregressive models - e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNN) and its many variants - to model the flow time series's temporal pattern. However, existing approaches rely on regular and accurate inflow observations, which either fail to predict multiscale inflow (e.g., an hour, a day, or a month ahead prediction) or ignore the uncertainty of observations due to confounding factors such as snowmelt and precipitation. To address the limitations, we propose a novel inflow forecasting model by incorporating the uncertainty of the observations into the RNN model and the continuous-time dynamics of the latent states with neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). Our method, called FlowODE, explicitly encodes the stochasticity of hidden conditions in addition to the temporal dependencies among inflow observations. Moreover, FlowODE explores a continuum of layers instead of discrete RNNs to model the hidden states' dynamics, allowing us to infer the inflow at any time horizon flexibly. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world datasets collected from two large-scale hydropower dams. The results show that our method consistently outperforms previous inflow forecasting models while providing adaptable predictions and a flexible balance between prediction accuracy and computational cost. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The data was collected from 'two large-scale hydropower dams', which is local data and therefore meets an exclusion criterion.",

This paper focuses on one such initiative contributing to attaining this goal, namely, the identification or prediction of disease in crops. More specifically the paper examines the automated quantification of the severity of common rust in maize. Previous work has focused on using standard image processing algorithms for this problem. This is the first study, to the knowledge of the authors, employing machine learning techniques to determine the severity of common rust disease in maize. Quantifying the severity of common rust is achieved by counting the number of pustules on maize leaves and determining the surface area of the leaf covered by pustules. In this study a Mask R-CNN is used to determine this. Both the standard image processing algorithms and the Mask R-CNN were evaluated on a real-world dataset created from images of maize leaves grown in a greenhouse. The Mask R-CNN was found to outperform the standard image processing algorithms in terms of counting the number of pustules, calculation of the pustule surface area and the average pustule size. These results were found to be statistically significant at a 5% level of significance. One of the challenges with Mask R-CNN is finding suitable parameter values, which is time consuming.

Current maps of global wetland extent vary in their wetland definition, causing substantial disagreement between and large uncertainty in estimates of wetland methane emissions. To reconcile these differences for large-scale wetland CH4 modeling, we developed the global Wetland Area and Dynamics for Methane Modeling (WAD2M) version 1.0 dataset at a ∼25 km resolution at the Equator (0.25°) at a monthly time step for 2000-2018. WAD2M combines a time series of surface inundation based on active and passive microwave remote sensing at a coarse resolution with six static datasets that discriminate inland waters, agriculture, shoreline, and non-inundated wetlands. We excluded all permanent water bodies (e.g., lakes, ponds, rivers, and reservoirs), coastal wetlands (e.g., mangroves and sea grasses), and rice paddies to only represent spatiotemporal patterns of inundated and non-inundated vegetated wetlands. Globally, WAD2M estimates the long-term maximum wetland area at 13:0×106 km2 (13.0Mkm2), which can be divided into three categories: mean annual minimum of inundated and non-inundated wetlands at 3.5Mkm2, seasonally inundated wetlands at 4.0Mkm2 (mean annual maximum minus mean annual minimum), and intermittently inundated wetlands at 5.5Mkm2 (long-term maximum minus mean annual maximum). WAD2M shows good spatial agreements with independent wetland inventories for major wetland complexes, i.e., the Amazon Basin lowlands and West Siberian lowlands, with Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.54 and 0.70 respectively among multiple wetland products.

This article explores the issue through a systematic review of the extant literature on gender and fertiliser use in maize production. The findings show that indeed a gender gap in the use of fertiliser exists. More than a decade after the World Bank identified a gender gap in fertiliser use, there are no systematic national or global data sets comparing fertiliser use by gender. While farm input subsidies can improve women farmer’s access to fertiliser and have a positive effect on agricultural productivity for both men and women farmers, this approach has little effect on reducing the gender gap in agricultural productivity. The challenges associated with gender and fertiliser access and use are complex and there is no silver bullet intervention that can address the problem, particularly in relation to intra-household dynamics and social norms. Thus solving the noted problem, will require a holistic approach rather than “simple” sectoral interventions. Over time, suboptimal fertiliser use depletes soils. Nutrient use efficiencies worsen under soil nutrient mining and degradation, thus economic incentives for fertiliser investments are also eroded in such situations, resulting in a vicious cycle. The development of nutrient use efficient maize seed technologies could be an intermediate step towards closing the gender gap in fertiliser use. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The abstract is a literature review that highlights the absence of specific global datasets, rather than using or producing one.

For single species, terrestrial mammal population densities have shown mixed responses to human pressure, with both increasing and decreasing densities reported in the literature. How the impacts of human activities on mammal populations translates into altered global density patterns remains unclear. Here we aim to disentangle the effect of human impacts on large-scale patterns of mammal population densities using a global dataset of 6729 population density estimates for 468 mammal species (representing 59% and 44% of mammalian orders and families). We fitted a mixed effect model to explain the variation in density based on a 1-degree resolution as a function of the human footprint index (HFI), a global proxy of direct and indirect human disturbances, while accounting for body mass, trophic level and primary productivity (normalized vegetation index; NDVI). We found a significant positive relationship between population density and HFI, where population densities were higher in areas with a higher HFI (e.g. agricultural or suburban areas – no populations were located in very high HFI urban areas) compared to areas with a low HFI (e.g. wilderness areas). We also tested the effect of the individual components of the HFI and still found a consistent positive effect. The relationships remained positive even across populations of the same species, although variability among species was high. Our results indicate shifts in mammal population densities in human modified landscapes, which is due to the combined effect of species filtering, increased resources and a possible reduction in competition and predation.

Good management requires information on the status of harvested species, yet many gaps remain in our understanding of these species and systems, in particular the lack of taxonomic resolution of harvested species. To assess these gaps we compared the occurrence of landed species (freshwater and marine) from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) global fisheries production database to those in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database, some of the largest and most comprehensive global datasets of consumed aquatic species. We also quantified the level of resolution and trends in taxonomic reporting for all landed taxa in the FAO database. Of the 1,695 consumed aquatic species or groups in the FAO database considered in this analysis, a large portion (35%) are missing from both of the other two global datasets, either IUCN or RAM, used to monitor, manage, and protect aquatic resources. Only a small number of all fished taxa reported in FAO data (150 out of 1,695; 9%) have both a stock assessment in RAM and a conservation assessment in IUCN. Furthermore, 40% of wild caught landings are not reported to the species level, limiting our ability to effectively account for the environmental impacts of wild harvest.

To do that, we developed a novel multi-objective assessment that evaluates the effectiveness of 104 practices adopted within the Mediterranean Basin and documented in the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies global database. Results indicate that agroforestry and green covers in perennial woody crops can promote multiple ecosystem services while addressing climate change adaptation. We further argue that these two practices together with reforestation, assist in regulating the hydrological cycle of the Basin and in maintaining its multifunctional landscape. Lastly, we reflect on potential biophysical and socio-economic barriers and opportunities associated with the implementation of the three practices. Our approach provides a Basin-wide integrated view that facilitates the coordination of sustainable management strategies across the Mediterranean region. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses a global database (WOCAT) to assess agricultural land management practices.

Naturalization success is highest for plants grown as animal food or for environmental uses (e.g. ornamentals), and increases with number of uses. Taxa from the Northern Hemisphere are disproportionately over-represented among economic plants, and economic plants from Asia have the greatest naturalization success. In regional naturalized floras, the percentage of economic plants exceeds the global percentage and increases towards the equator. Phylogenetic patterns in the naturalized flora partly result from phylogenetic patterns in the plants we cultivate.

Although Chile is recognized as one of the most affected countries by climate change, it is also one of the least covered by hydrometeorological measuring instruments. This data scarcity prevents thorough characterization of hydrological basins. To solve this problem, we constructed a decade-long (2000–2011) high-resolution (Formula presented.) monthly gridded precipitation product for the central-southern zone (Formula presented.) covering regions from O’Higgins to Los Ríos. These regions contain most of Chile’s agricultural land, livestock, forestry, and hydroelectric production. The study zone covers a variety of topographies and climates, including eight hydrological basins: Rapel, Mataquito, Maule, Itata, BioBío, Imperial, Toltén, and Valdivia. We develop a dynamic topo-climatic methodology that includes local and global data. We combined a dynamic downscaling and a spatial-temporal multivariate model over different geographical areas that considered high-resolution precipitation fields from model data, in situ stations, and different global precipitation datasets that also understand satellite observations. Results show that most of the precipitation spatial-temporal variability is well-captured by the model in the north and central regions, from O’Higgins to Biobío, with the goodness of fit (Formula presented.) fluctuating around 0.86 and 0.82, respectively. Toward the south, Araucanía and Los Ríos, the goodness of fit (Formula presented.) decreased to values around 0.74 and 0.72, respectively.

However, predicting plausible future global distributions of croplands remains challenging. Here, we show that, in general, existing global data aligned with classical economic theories of expansion explain the current (1992) global extent of cropland reasonably well, but not recent expansion (1992–2015). Deviations from models of cropland extent in 1992 (“frontierness”) can be used to improve global models of recent expansion, most likely as these deviations are a proxy for cropland expansion under frontier conditions where classical economic theories of expansion are less applicable. Frontierness is insensitive to the land cover dataset used and is particularly effective in improving models that include mosaic land cover classes and the largely smallholder-driven frontier expansion occurring in such areas. Our findings have important implications as the frontierness approach offers a straightforward way to improve global land use change models.; Predicting where cropland is likely to expand globally has important implications for climate change and biodiversity. However, doing so is challenging because of a lack of data on key drivers of current expansion in so-called frontier areas (e.g., governance). Here, we show that using deviations from a model of cropland extent in 1992 built on all available data improves models of recent (1992–2015) cropland expansion over and above using the best available existing data.; Cropland area is increasing globally to satisfy the growing population and consumption rates. Cropland expansion often comes at the expense of forests, which are critical for conserving biodiversity and mitigating against climate change. Therefore, it is essential to know where cropland expansion is likely to occur in the future in order to design policies that prevent expansion in areas that are most likely to conflict with forest conservation. However, predicting where expansion is most likely is difficult as few data are available on key predictors related to governance. Here, we devise a novel, two-stage method for predicting expansion of cropland. First, available data are used to model where cropland existed in 1992. We then use maps that show where the first model fails to explain cropland in 1992 to help predict expansion of cropland between 1992 and 2015.

Using a global dataset composed of 5242 observations encompassing 48 agricultural pest species and 26 crop species, we tested the role of pest traits (exotic status, host breadth and habitat breadth) and environmental context (crop type, range in landscape gradient and climate) in modifying the pest response to increasing semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape. For natives, increasing semi-natural habitats decreased the abundance of pests that exploit only crop habitats or that are highly polyphagous. On the contrary, populations of exotic pests increased with an increasing cover of semi-natural habitats. These effects might be related to changes in host plants and other resources across the landscapes and/or to modified top-down control by natural enemies. The range of the landscape gradient explored and climate did not affect pests, while crop type modified the response of pests to landscape composition. Although species traits and environmental context helped in explaining some of the variability in pest response to landscape composition, the observed large interspecific differences suggest that a portfolio of strategies must be considered and implemented for the effective control of rapidly changing communities of crop pests in agroecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses a specific global dataset on agricultural pests and crops, meeting all inclusion criteria.",

KDE allows direct estimation of the bivariate cumulative density function which can be used to extract the marginal distributions with minimal subjectivity. The approach provided excellent fits to bivariate relationships between the standardized soil moisture index (SSMI) computed at three-and six-month accumulations and standardized measures of precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and atmospheric water deficit (AWD = P − PET) at 187 stations in the High Plains region of the US overlying the Ogallala Aquifer. The likelihood of an agricultural drought given a precipitation deficit could be as high as 40–65% within the study area during summer months and between 20–55% during winter months. The relationship between agricultural drought risks and precipitation deficits is strongest in the agriculturally intensive central portions of the study area. The conditional risks of agricultural droughts given unfavorable PET conditions are higher in the eastern humid portions than the western arid portions. Unfavorable PET had a higher impact on the six-month standardized soil moisture index (SSMI6) but was also seen to influence three-month SSMI (SSMI3). Dry states as defined by AWD produced higher risks than either P or PET, suggesting that both of these variables influence agricultural droughts. Agricultural drought risks under favorable conditions of AWD were much lower than when AWD was unfavorable. The agricultural drought risks were higher during the winter when AWD was favorable and point to the role of soil characteristics on agricultural droughts. The information provides a drought atlas for an agriculturally important region in the US and, as such, is of practical use to decision makers.

We describe a connectivity conservation planning framework that draws on recent advances in the fields of surveying, modelling, and optimizing removal of crossings that block aquatic organism passage. We demonstrate this framework with a case study involving 1200 crossings surveyed in Florida, USA in which barrier severity was quantified on a continuous scale from 0 (complete barrier) to 1 (no barrier). Using field surveys, we built a boosted regression tree (BRT) model that linked barrier severity to 44 landscape variables representing natural (e.g., stream size) and anthropogenic (e.g., land use) stream conditions. We used a recently developed optimization routine to conduct two scenarios, including (1) surveyed crossings only and (2) surveyed crossings plus crossings modelled at 5545 unsurveyed locations. The BRT model explained 54% of variation in barrier severity scores and showed that the most severe barriers occurred on small, high-elevation streams draining urban and agricultural catchments. Estimates of connectivity gains following remediation were 5.3-times lower when unsurveyed locations were included in the optimization, suggesting inclusion of unsurveyed sites is critical for conservation planning. Results from this framework can be used over short (e.g., planning immediate barrier mitigation) and long (e.g., planning future field surveys) time horizons to benefit aquatic connectivity conservation.

Existing global datasets associated with cropland are limited by insufficient spatial resolution to properly represent areas with small parcel size distributions, and their less-than-ideal accuracies hamper application at regional and local scales. Diverse very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite systems are now available, offering sub-meter to five-meter resolution (e.g. Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2, and ZiYuan-3), and hence enabling explicit extraction of cropland areas from heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes. This study presented a generalized methodology for operational cropland mapping at very high resolution using a deep convolutional neural network to automatically learn the robust and discriminative features. Specifically, we slightly modified the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) and combined deep long-range features with shadow local features to provide predictions with high level of detail. We demonstrated the modified PSPNet (MPSPNet) over four province-wide study areas (Heilongjiang, Hebei, Zhejiang and Guangdong) with diverse agrosystems across China from north to south using multi-source very high spatial resolution satellite images (mainly Gaofen-1 supplemented with Gaofen-2 and ZiYuan-3), with the overall accuracies ranging from 89.99% to 92.31%. Moreover, we compared MPSPNet with other CNN models and investigated the its behavior by visualizing the learned features on different layers, indicating that combining low and high level features for final classification was an efficient and accurate strategy for cropland mapping because the former capture edge information related to object boundaries and the latter could learn long-range spatial dependencies that helped recognize croplands. The temporal transfer and spatial transfer assessments from the respects of qualitative and quantitative corroborated the robust generalizability of the proposed method. And the contrast to the traditional object-based classification method also demonstrated the advantages and strong generalization capabilities of MPSPNet in extracting cropland using VHSR remote sensed images.

However, it is difficult to accurately estimate actual evapotranspiration (AET) in areas with high spatial heterogeneity along with very little ancillary data available. The presence of spatial heterogeneity is observed over India and being a country, whose economy largely depends on agriculture, estimation of AET is crucial for efficient water management. This study proposed a new framework to evaluate AET at a fine spatial scale suitable for such heterogeneous and data-sparse environments, with spatial and temporal validation using global datasets. Landsat 8 data were used to estimate AET for eight cloud-free days of 2014 over the Malaprabha River Basin in India using the modified surface energy balance algorithm for land (M-SEBAL) and two-source energy balance (TSEB) models.

SASAM is based on the fusion of multiple existing cropland maps and multilevel statistics of the cropland area, which is independent of training samples. First, cropland area statistics are used to rank the input cropland maps, and then a scoring table is built to indicate the agreement among the input datasets. Secondly, statistics are allocated adaptively to the pixels with higher agreement scores until the cumulative cropland area is close to the statistics. The multilevel allocation results are then integrated to obtain the extent of cropland. We applied SASAM to produce a global cropland synergy map with a 500 m spatial resolution for circa 2010.

Increasing the ability to adapt to adverse impacts of climate change is an important task for Mediterranean agriculture. The indicators selected are widely used by practitioners in this grapevine production sector, linking science to the tools used by stakeholders and therefore encouraging action and innovation among all stakeholders.

We describe the new capabilities of representing crop distributions and management in the Community Land Model (CLM) Version 5, which includes time-varying spatial distributions of major crop types and their management through fertilization and irrigation, and temperature-based phenological triggers. Including active crop management increases peak growing season gross primary productivity (GPP), increases the amplitude of Northern Hemisphere net ecosystem exchange, and changes seasonal and annual patterns of latent and sensible heat fluxes. The CLM5 crop model simulates the global observed historical trend of crop yields with relative fidelity from 1850 to 1990. Cropland expansion was important for increasing crop production, especially during the first century of the simulations, while fertilization and irrigation were important for increasing yields from 1950 onward. From 1990 to present day, observed crop production continued to increase while CLM5 production levels off, likely because intensification practices are not represented in the model.

Pollinators are essential for the reproduction of wild and cultivated plant species. Protected areas contribute to pollinator conservation by providing key nesting and foraging habitats. We estimate how much of the pantropical pollination service is currently within terrestrial protected areas. We used publicly available global datasets to generate variables known to predict pollinator abundance and have built a pantropical spatially explicit model of the pollination service. Our results suggest that 80% of tropical protected areas contribute to crop pollination. Protected areas (PAs) that currently do not contribute to crop pollination may contribute in the future as agriculturalisation continues and they begin to neighbour croplands. The remaining PAs provide habitat for pollinators of wild plants, alongside many other ecosystem services. Small-sized PAs provide higher pollination service per unit area than large ones due to their greater proximity to crops in general and their greater perimeter per unit area. These small PAs also tend to be under greater anthropogenic pressure than large-sized tropical PAs.

To this end, the Interaction between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere (ISBA-A-gs) is evaluated at a complex open olive orchard and, for the purposes of comparison, on a winter wheat field taken as an example of a homogeneous canopy. The initial version of ISBA-A-gs, based on a composite energy budget (hereafter ISBA-1P for one patch), is compared to the new multiple energy balance (MEB) version of ISBA that represents a double source arising from the vegetation located above the soil layer. In addition, a patch representation corresponding to two adjacent, uncoupled source schemes (hereafter ISBA-2P for two patches) is also considered for the olive orchard. Continuous observations of evapotranspiration (ET), with an eddy covariance system and plant transpiration (Tr) with sap flow and isotopic methods were used to evaluate the three representations. A preliminary sensitivity analyses showed a strong sensitivity to the parameters related to turbulence in the canopy introduced in the new ISBA-MEB version. For wheat, the ability of the single-and dual-source configuration to reproduce the composite soil-vegetation heat fluxes was very similar; the root mean square error (RMSE) differences between ISBA-1P, ISBA-2P and ISBA-MEB did not exceed 10Wm2 for the latent heat flux. These results showed that a composite energy balance in homogeneous covers is sufficient to reproduce the total convective fluxes. The two configurations are also fairly close to the isotopic observations of transpiration in spite of a light underestimation (overestimation) of ISBA. 1P (ISBA-MEB). At the olive orchard, contrasting results are obtained. The dual-source configurations, including both the uncoupled (ISBA-2P) and the coupled (ISBA-MEB) representations, outperformed the single-source version (ISBA-1P), with slightly better results for ISBA-MEB in predicting both total heat fluxes and evapotranspiration partition. Concerning plant transpiration in particular, the coupled approach ISBA-MEB provides better results than ISBA-1P and, to a lesser extent, ISBA-2P with RMSEs of 1.60, 0.90, and 0.70mmd1 and R2 of 0.43, 0.69, and 0.70 for ISBA-1P, ISBA-2P and ISBA-MEB, respectively. In addition, it is shown that the acceptable predictions of composite convective fluxes by ISBA-2P for the olive orchard are obtained for the wrong reasons as neither of the two patches is in agreement with the observations because of a bad spatial distribution of the roots and a lack of incoming radiation screening for the bare soil patch. This work shows that composite convection fluxes predicted by the SURFace EXternalisée (SURFEX) platform and the partition of evapotranspiration in a highly transient regime due to irrigation is improved for moderately open tree canopies by the new coupled dualsource ISBA-MEB model. It also points out the need for further local-scale evaluations on different crops of various geometry (more open rainfed agriculture or a denser, intensive olive orchard) to provide adequate parameterisation to global database, such as ECOCLIMAP-II, in the view of a global application of the ISBA-MEB model. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study is based on data collected at a specific local site in Marrakech, Morocco, which violates the global coverage criterion.",

It quantifies the effect of change from annual to perennial crops and the subsequent temporal changes in SOC stocks during the perennial crop cycle. It also presents an empirical model to estimate changes in the SOC content under crops as a function of time, land use, and site characteristics. We used a harmonized global dataset containing paired-comparison empirical values of SOC and different types of perennial crops (perennial grasses, palms, and woody plants) with different end uses: bioenergy, food, other bio-products, and short rotation coppice. Salient outcomes include: a 20-year period encompassing a change from annual to perennial crops led to an average 20% increase in SOC at 0–30 cm (6.0 ± 4.6 Mg/ha gain) and a total 10% increase over the 0–100 cm soil profile (5.7 ± 10.9 Mg/ha). A change from natural pasture to perennial crop decreased SOC stocks by 1% over 0–30 cm (−2.5 ± 4.2 Mg/ha) and 10% over 0–100 cm (−13.6 ± 8.9 Mg/ha). The effect of a land use change from forest to perennial crops did not show significant impacts, probably due to the limited number of plots; but the data indicated that while a 2% increase in SOC was observed at 0–30 cm (16.81 ± 55.1 Mg/ha), a decrease in 24% was observed at 30–100 cm (−40.1 ± 16.8 Mg/ha). Perennial crops generally accumulate SOC through time, especially woody crops; and temperature was the main driver explaining differences in SOC dynamics, followed by crop age, soil bulk density, clay content, and depth.

Millions of hectares of land have changed hands for agriculture-driven development over the past decade, and their implementation generates substantial risk of land degradation. This paper investigates land transaction patterns and evaluate their potential socio-environmental impacts in Cambodia, Ethiopia, Liberia, and Peru. We undertake a novel spatially explicit approach to quantify land transactions and conduct scenario-based analyses to explore their implementation consequences on people, land, and carbon emission. Our results demonstrate that existing global datasets on land transactions substantially underestimate their incidence but can either exaggerate or underreport transacted areas. Although confirming that land transactions are more likely to occur in sparsely populated, poorer, and more forested areas, our scenario-based analyses reveal that if fully implemented for agricultural development, land transactions in the four countries will affect more than one million people, yield over 2 Gt of carbon emissions, and disrupt vast swathes of forests. Our findings refute the 'empty land' discourse in government policy and highlight the consequences of land degradation that can occur at an unexpected scale in the 'global land rush.'

Cropping intensity and sowing month are two essential parameters for analyzing the food-water-climate tradeoff as food sustainability indicators. This study presents a global-scale analysis of cropping intensity and sowing month from 2000 to 2015, divided into three groups of years. The study methodology integrates the satellite-derived normalized vegetation index (NDVI) of 16-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and daily land-surface-water coverage (LSWC) data obtained from The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E/2) in 1-km aggregate pixel resolution. A fast Fourier transform was applied to normalize the MODIS NDVI time-series data. By using advanced methods with intensive optic and microwave time-series data, this study set out to anticipate potential dynamic changes in global cropland activity over 15 years representing the Millennium Development Goal period. These products are the first global datasets that provide information on crop activities in 15-year data derived from optic and microwave satellite data. The results show that in 2000-2005, the total global double-crop intensity was 7.1 million km2, which increased to 8.3 million km2 in 2006-2010, and then to approximately 8.6 million km2 in 2011-2015. In the same periods, global triple-crop agriculture showed a rapid positive growth from 0.73 to 1.12 and then 1.28 million km2, respectively. The results show that Asia dominated doubleand triple-crop growth, while showcasing the expansion of single-cropping area in Africa.

The proposed method applies a linear spectral mixing model (LSMM) to PROBA-V time series images to derive vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images for regional analysis. We used S10-TOC (10 days synthesis, 1 km spatial resolution, and top-of-canopy) products for Brazil and S5-TOC (five days synthesis, 100 m spatial resolution, and top-of-canopy) products for Mato Grosso State (Brazilian Legal Amazon). Using the time series of the vegetation fraction images of the whole year (2015 in this case), only one mosaic composed with maximum values of vegetation fraction was generated, allowing detecting and mapping semi-automatically the areas occupied by annual crops during the year. The results (100 m spatial resolution map) for the Mato Grosso State were compared with existing global datasets (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring-Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC) and Global Food Security-Support Analyses Data (GFSAD30)). Visually those maps present a good agreement, but the area estimated are not comparable since the agricultural class definition are different for those maps. In addition, we found 11.8 million ha of agricultural areas in the entire Brazilian territory. The area estimation for the Mato Grosso State was 3.4 million ha for 1 km dataset and 5.3 million ha for 100 m dataset. This difference is due to the spatial resolution of the PROBA-V datasets used. A coefficient of determination of 0.82 was found between PROBA-V 100 m and Landsat-8 OLI area estimations for the Mato Grosso State.

In particular, site-specific effects of NT on the soil pH, and soil physical properties including bulk density, total porosity, aggregate size and stability, hydraulic property, available water capacity have been intensively studied within various agroecosystems in the past decades. However, the synthesis of information on a global scale remains lacking. Here, using a global dataset based on 264 publications, effects of agronomic/environmental factors on soil physical properties under NT were quantified by intensive meta-analysis. We found that the effects of NT on soil physical properties are fairly complex, and greatly depend on climate conditions, experimental duration, and soil texture. Specifically, relative to CT, NT increased soil bulk density by 2.3%. Soil bulk density increased by 3.7% during the first 6 years of NT. Meanwhile, NT increased soil penetration resistance by 27.8%; NT decreased soil pH by 1.8%, the greatest reduction took place in silty soils (5.6%) or during a moderate-term NT (6–12 years, 5.0%). Nonetheless, regardless of environmental and agronomic factors, NT improved mean weight diameter and water-stable aggregate by 50 and 36%, respectively. Although NT had no effects on the saturated hydraulic conductivity, it enhanced soil available water capacity by 8.7%. Taken altogether, the trade-offs between observed negative effects such as increased bulk density and decreased soil pH; and positive effects such as improved aggregate size and stability, and soil water availability demonstrate the overall beneficial responses on soil physical property under global NT agriculture. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that climate conditions (e.g. mean annual precipitation and temperature), and experimental duration appeared to be the predominant factors controlling the response of soil properties to NT application.

To estimate the magnitude of pesticide drift from aerial or ground applications, regulatory agencies in North America, Europe, and elsewhere rely on spray drift models to predict spray drift deposition for risk assessments. Refined assessments should ultimately depend on best-available data for exposure modeling. However, when developing lower tier “screening” assessments designed to indicate whether further refinement is needed, regulators often make conservative assumptions with a resulting increased level of uncertainty in estimating environmental exposure or risk. In the United States, it is generally accepted that, to ensure conservative regulatory assessments, it is reasonable to assume that the wind speed might be 4.47 m/s (10 miles per hour [mph]), the relative humidity and temperature are highly conducive to drift, and the wind is blowing directly toward a receiving water for any given single spray event in a season. However, what is the probability these conditions will all co-occur for each of 4 sequential spray events spaced a week apart (common practice for insecticides)? The refined approach in the present study investigates this question using hourly meteorological data sets for 5 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standard crop scenarios to understand how real-world data can reduce unnecessary uncertainty for sequential applications. The impact of wind speeds, temperatures, relative humidity, and wind direction at different times of day on annual drift loadings has been examined using a stepwise process for comparison with corresponding regulatory default loading estimates. The impacts on drift estimates were significant; interestingly, the time of day of the applications impacted variability more than did the selected crop scenario. When all these real-world factors were considered, estimated 30-y total drift loads ranged from 2% to 5% greater than the default estimate (2 of 30 cases due to high afternoon wind speeds) to 51% to 86% reductions (25 of 30 cases) with an overall average reduction of 63%.

The removal of natural vegetation changes local climate, with human-dominated land uses often warmer and drier than natural habitats. Yet, it remains an open question whether land-use changes influence the composition of ecological assemblages in a direction consistent with the mechanism of local climatic change. Here, we used a global database of terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians) to test whether human-dominated land uses systematically favour species with distinctive realised climatic niches. We 1) explored the responses of community-average temperature and precipitation niches to different types of land use, 2) quantified the abundances of species with distinctive climatic niches across land uses and 3) tested for differences in emergent patterns in communities from tropical versus temperate latitudes. We found that, in comparison to species from undisturbed natural habitats, the average animal found in human-altered habitats lives in areas with higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures and higher maximum and lower minimum precipitation levels. We further found that tropical assemblages diverged more strongly than temperate assemblages between natural and human-altered habitats, possibly because tropical species are more sensitive to climatic conditions. These results strongly implicate the role of land-use change in favouring species affiliated with more extreme climatic conditions, thus systematically reshaping the composition of terrestrial biological assemblages.

Complex interactions between solid ash surfaces and volcanic gases lead to the formation of soluble salts that may be mobilized in aqueous environments. A variety of stakeholders may be concerned about the effects of ash on human and animal health, drinking water supplies, crops, soils and surface runoff. As part of the immediate emergency response, rapid dissemination of information regarding potentially hazardous concentrations of soluble species is critical. However, substantial variability in the methods used to characterize leachable elements makes it challenging to compare datasets and eruption impacts. To address these challenges, the International Volcanic Health Hazard Network (www.ivhhn.org) organized a two-day workshop to define appropriate methods for hazard assessment. The outcome of this workshop was a ‘consensus protocol’ for analysis of volcanic ash samples for rapid assessment of hazards from leachable elements, which was subsequently ratified by leading volcanological organizations. The purpose of this protocol is to recommend clear, standard and reliable methods applicable to a range of purposes during eruption response, such as assessing impacts on drinking-water supplies and ingestion hazards to livestock, and also applicable to research purposes. Where possible, it is intended that the methods make use of commonly available equipment and require little training. To evaluate method transferability, an interlaboratory comparison exercise was organized among six laboratories worldwide. Each laboratory received a split of pristine ash, and independently analyzed it according to the protocol for a wide range of elements. Collated results indicate good repeatability and reproducibility for most elements, thus indicating that the development of this protocol is a useful step towards providing standardized and reliable methods for ash hazard characterization. In this article, we review recent ash leachate studies, report the outcomes of the comparison exercise and present a revised and updated protocol based on the experiences and recommendations of the exercise participants.

Past efforts in understanding whether, and to what extent, adaptation improves household welfare have faced some key challenges including: 1) endogeneity of adaptation; 2) localized results that are difficult to generalize; and 3) understanding whether the efficacy of adaptation depends on the reasons for adaptation (e.g. market conditions vs climate change). In this study we estimate effects of smallholder agricultural adaptation on food security, while addressing each of these three challenges. First, we identify and test instrumental variables based on neighbor networks. Second, we use a dataset that contains information from 5159 households located across 15 countries in Africa, Asia, and Central America. Third, we investigate whether adaptation that is motivated by changes in market conditions influences the efficacy of adaptation differently than adaptation motivated by climate change. Across our global sample, an average household made almost 10 adaptive changes, which are responsible for approximately 47 days of food security yearly; an amount nearly 4 times larger than is indicated if endogeneity is not addressed. But these effects vary depending on what is motivating adaptation. Adaptation in response to climate change alone is not found to significantly affect food security. When climate adaptation is paired with adaptation in response to changing market conditions, the resulting impact is 96 food secure days.

We utilise F<inf>1</inf> score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, to show our system matches the state-of-the-art detection accuracy (F<inf>1</inf>: 0.793 vs. 0.799) in controlled conditions; has greater generalisation and robustness to variation of spatial parameters (camera viewpoint) in the real-world data-set (F<inf>1</inf>: 0.744); and at a fraction of the computational cost allowing classification at almost 30fps. We propose that the L*a*b*Fruits system addresses some of the most pressing limitations of current fruit detection systems and is well-suited to application in areas such as yield forecasting and harvesting.

Within this period, the largest ESV increment was observed in cultivated land with an increasing of US$33.47 million, and the largest decreasing was observed in grazing land with a decreasing of US$47.35 million. Based on local and global data, the agriculture land ESV were US$8,610.34 and US$1.34 million ha−1 year−1, respectively.

These technologies increase productivity as well as reduce labor significantly. In this paper, we focus on improving the autonomous cow estrus detection system in terms of energy consumption and precision. In previous detection pipelines, an accelerometer is mounted to the neck of cows to capture motion data with high frequency, followed by the ML algorithm to check the data and determine whether it is in estrus or not. Instead, we configured the accelerometer to sample with low frequency for minimizing its energy consumption. However, low-sampling rate as input of ML pipeline leads to an undesirable higher false alarm rate. To solve this problems, we designed a pipeline of unsupervised learning with a new heuristic post-processing algorithm. The proposed post-processing algorithm is a backtracking algorithm that incorporates the timing constraint of the period obtained by agriculture knowledge. With the constraint, the postprocessing algorithm facilitates a significantly higher precision than simple adaptive threshold techniques in previous studies on a simulated dataset.

We show that, when priority areas are identified based only on individual, e.g. functional diversity, or any combination of the three biodiversity components, these areas do not allow a sufficient protection of the three ecosystem services.

The main drivers are the deterioration in the terms of trade that offsets all the potential gains from the better allocation of economic resources due to free trade. For Turkey, trade liberalisation induces net welfare gains under all scenarios.

Hierarchical clustering of host and country range allowed characterisation of invasion potential. Phytophthora descriptions rose to 86 by the year 2000, surging to over 180 species to date driven primarily by novel molecular techniques, resulting in a species richness estimate of 326 (95% CI: 274–378).

In addition there are now readily available national and global datasets, such as rainfall and MODIS, which can be used to represent the crop-growing environment. Rather than analysing one field at a time as is typical in precision agriculture research, there is an opportunity to explore the value of combining data over multiple fields/farms and years into one dataset. Using these datasets in conjunction with machine learning approaches allows predictive models of crop yield to be built. In this study, several large farms in Western Australia were used as a case study, and yield monitor data from wheat, barley and canola crops from three different seasons (2013, 2014 and 2015) that covered ~ 11 000 to ~ 17 000 hectares in each year were used. The yield data were processed to a 10 m grid, and for each observation point associated predictor variables in space and time were collated. The data were then aggregated to a 100 m spatial resolution for modelling yield. Random forest models were used to predict crop yield of wheat, barley and canola using this dataset. Three separate models were created based on pre-sowing, mid-season and late-season conditions to explore the changes in the predictive ability of the model as more within-season information became available. These time points also coincide with points in the season when a management decision is made, such as the application of fertiliser. The models were evaluated with cross-validation using both fields and years for data splitting, and this was assessed at the field spatial resolution. Cross-validated results showed the models predicted yield relatively accurately, with a root mean square error of 0.36 to 0.42 t ha−1, and a Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient of 0.89 to 0.92 at the field resolution. The models performed better as the season progressed, largely because more information about within-season data became available (e.g. rainfall). The more years of yield data that were available for a field, the better the predictions were, and future work should use a longer time-series of yield data. The generic nature of this method makes it possible to apply to other agricultural systems where yield monitor data is available. Future work should also explore the integration of more data sources into the models, focus on predicting at finer spatial resolutions within fields, and the possibility of using the yield forecasts to guide management decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract states the use of readily available national and global datasets, such as MODIS, for crop yield modeling, meeting all criteria.",MODIS

Indices exist to identify sensor data with structured spatial variation, conducive to site-specific management. However, these indices do not indicate if this spatial variation is driven by managerial or environmental effects. A new index is proposed to identify perennial (or ordered row) fields that are likely or highly likely to have management effects within the spatial pattern of sensor data. This is determined by investigating differences in anisotropic (directional) variograms parallel and perpendicular to the direction of management (row orientation). Small differences are indicative of isotropic (environmental-driven) variation. Large differences indicate row and management effects. The index is derived, run on a database of 1080 simulated fields and applied to yield data from 124 vineyard blocks to assess index performance and response to different levels of variation. Simulations showed that the index is non-responsive to the magnitude of variation but responds strongly to anisotropy in the data. The stochastic variance in the data was observed to have an effect on index response and may be problematic when applied to noisy data sets. The index scores for the simulated and real-world data showed a similar pattern of response and the index was able to identify vineyard blocks where differential row management had generated differing yield responses.

On a global scale, most methods focus on one major sector, such as irrigated agriculture which accounts for a substantial portion of groundwater use on a global-scale. However, this may misrepresent groundwater abstractions in regions significantly impacted by other sectors on a local-scale. The objective of this paper is to quantify annual average groundwater use through a multi-method sectoral approach for regions where groundwater abstraction data are scarce. Sectoral methods are developed for the annual volumetric quantification and spatial distribution of groundwater use for municipal water distribution systems, private domestic well users in municipal and rural regions, industrial use for manufacturing, mining, and oil and gas industries, irrigated agriculture, and finfish aquaculture. Results suggest that British Columbia (BC) uses a total of ∼562 million cubic metres of groundwater annually. The largest annual groundwater use by major sector is agriculture (38%), finfish aquaculture (21%), industrial (16%), municipal water distribution systems (15%), and domestic private well users (11%). This paper highlights the implications of using downscaled values of groundwater use from global datasets for aquifer-scale estimates, which can be misrepresentative in regions where groundwater use is unregulated or newly regulated, as is the case in BC.

Further, combining with a global dataset, we determined subpopulation identity using both model-based and multivariate analyses to uncover their history. We found moderate to high genetic diversity and high differentiation [standardized G<inf>ST</inf> = 0.57].

The presence of aromatic aus probably implied assimilation into local culture from the primary aus growing region of Bangladesh and India. Likewise, the arrival of japonica may stem from the exchange of goods among neighbouring dynasties via Southern and Southwestern Silk routes.

This question has considerable relevance and practical implications for precision agriculture as visible spatial differences in crop development and yield are often directly related to horizontal and vertical variations in soil texture caused by, for example, complex deposition/erosion processes. In addition, active and relict geomorphological settings, such as floodplains and buried paleochannels, can cast significant complexity into surface hydrology and crop modeling. This also requires a better approach to detect, quantify, and analyze topsoil and subsoil heterogeneity and soil-crop interaction.

A comparison of the mass absorption coefficient of water-soluble BrC (b<inf>abs-WSBrC-365nm</inf>) in PM<inf>2.5</inf> with that in PM<inf>10</inf> sampled over the Bay of Bengal reveals the dominance of BrC in fine mode. Furthermore, the b<inf>abs-BrC-365nm</inf> shows a significant linear relationship with mass concentrations of airborne particulate matter, water-soluble organic carbon and non-sea-salt-K+ in the continental outflow from the IGP. This observation emphasizes the ubiquitous nature and significant contribution of water-soluble BrC from biomass burning emissions (BBEs). Comparing the absorption properties from this study with global datasets, it is discernible that BBEs dominate BrC absorption. Furthermore, the imaginary refractive index of water-soluble BrC (k<inf>WSBrC-365nm</inf>) in marine aerosols sampled over the North Indian Ocean during November is significantly higher than during December to January. Thus, significant temporal variability is associated with crop-residue burning emissions in the IGP on the composition of BrC over the North Indian Ocean.

Following systematic steps, a range of original methods from data sources and methods comparison, data re-calibration, time slices selection, data supplement, to cropland area fraction calculation were used. The cropland area at the county level was allocated into grid cells of 10 km × 10 km so as to achieve a high spatial resolution and precision.

The spatial distribution of cropland change over the past 300 years corresponded to the patterns of the total cropland change in North China Plain Area. From the late 17th century to the 1980s, the cropland area fraction in the plains increased and the cropland expanded to the hilly and coastal areas gradually. After that, the cropland area fraction in the plains decreased, especially in the southeastern of North China Plain Area. The total cropland area in North China Plain Area of our study is close to the results of most previous studies but the maps generated based on our dataset present local difference of cropland distribution more clearly than a recent important global dataset HYDE3.2.

Satellite observations provide global data on spatiotemporal patterns of biomass burning and evidence for the rapid changes in global fire activity in response to land management and climate. Satellite imagery also provides detailed information on the daily or sub-daily position of fires that can be used to understand the dynamics of individual fires. The Global Fire Atlas is a new global dataset that tracks the dynamics of individual fires to determine the timing and location of ignitions, fire size and duration, and daily expansion, fire line length, speed, and direction of spread. Here, we present the underlying methodology and Global Fire Atlas results for 2003-2016 derived from daily moderate-resolution (500 m) Collection 6 MCD64A1 burned-area data. The algorithm identified 13.3 million individual fires over the study period, and estimated fire perimeters were in good agreement with independent data for the continental United States. A small number of large fires dominated sparsely populated arid and boreal ecosystems, while burned area in agricultural and other human-dominated landscapes was driven by high ignition densities that resulted in numerous smaller fires. Long-duration fires in boreal regions and natural landscapes in the humid tropics suggest that fire season length exerts a strong control on fire size and total burned area in these areas. In arid ecosystems with low fuel densities, high fire spread rates resulted in large, short-duration fires that quickly consumed available fuels. Importantly, multiday fires contributed the majority of burned area in all biomass burning regions. A first analysis of the largest, longest and fastest fires that occurred around the world revealed coherent regional patterns of extreme fires driven by large-scale climate forcing.

In the East Asian–Australasian Flyway (EAAF), however, the stopover ecology of migratory waterfowl is severely under-studied. The knowledge gaps regarding the timing, intensity and duration of stopover site usages prevent the development of effective and full annual cycle conservation strategies for migratory waterfowl in EAAF. In this study, we obtained a total of 33,493 relocations and visualized 33 completed spring migratory paths of five geese species using satellite tracking devices. We delineated 2,192,823 ha as the key stopover sites along the migration routes and found that croplands were the largest land use type within the stopover sites, followed by wetlands and natural grasslands (62.94%, 17.86% and 15.48% respectively). We further identified the conservation gaps by overlapping the stopover sites with the World Database on Protected Areas (PA). The results showed that only 15.63% (or 342,757 ha) of the stopover sites are covered by the current PA network.

It is necessary to conduct regional scale assessments of these global scenarios, identifying their uncertainties and pointing out directions for improvement. Based on the regional reconstruction Li-dataset, remotely sensed dataset, and grazing intensity dataset, the uncertainties of land use area and geographical distribution in HYDE3.1, HYDE3.2, and SAGE (a global land dataset from the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment) scenarios for the Qinghai–Tibet Area (QTA) are evaluated. The comparisons show that the cropland areas on the QTA in HYDE3.2 for 1900–2000 are close to those of the Li-dataset, whereas HYDE3.1 underestimated and SAGE overestimated the cropland areas significantly. Spatially, HYDE3.1, HYDE3.2, and SAGE have large uncertainties, which cannot reflect the distribution of cropland on the QTA and its changes for 1900–2000 well, and too much cropland is allocated to southeastern Tibet. HYDE3.1 and HYDE3.2 overestimated the pasture area and its distribution on the QTA significantly. The distribution of pasture in SAGE showed overall an agreement with the spatial pattern for grazing intensity, but changes in grazing intensity for 2000–2010 was not reflected in SAGE. The FAO pasture definition and estimates and the method of using population as a proxy for pasture area are not appropriate for the QTA. Methodology which uses the pasture inventory data to calibrate satellite-based grassland maps to obtain the current pasture maps may also not be appropriate because of the lacking differentiation between natural and anthropogenic grasslands in remotely sensed data.

Efficient water management nowadays depends a lot upon simulation models. However, the availability of limited hydro-meteorological data together with limited data sharing practices prohibits simulation modelling and consequently efficient flood risk management of sparsely gauged basins. Advances in remote sensing has significantly contributed to carrying out hydrological studies in ungauged or sparsely gauged basins. In particular, the global datasets of remote sensing observations (e.g., rainfall, evaporation, temperature, land use, terrain, etc.) allow to develop hydrological and hydraulic models of sparsely gauged catchments. In this research, we have considered large scale hydrological and hydraulic modelling, using freely available global datasets, of the sparsely gauged trans-boundary Brahmaputra basin, which has an enormous potential in terms of agriculture, hydropower, water supplies and other utilities. A semi-distributed conceptual hydrological model was developed using HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Modelling System from Hydrologic Engineering Centre). Rainfall estimates from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) was compared with limited gauge data and used in the simulation. The Nash Sutcliffe coefficient of the model with the uncorrected rainfall data in calibration and validation were 0.75 and 0.61 respectively whereas the similar values with the corrected rainfall data were 0.81 and 0.74. The output of the hydrological model was used as a boundary condition and lateral inflow to the hydraulic model. Modelling results obtained using uncorrected and corrected remotely sensed products of rainfall were compared with the discharge values at the basin outlet (Bahadurabad) and with altimetry data from Jason-2 satellite. The simulated flood inundation maps of the lower part of the Brahmaputra basin showed reasonably good match in terms of the probability of detection, success ratio and critical success index. Overall, this study demonstrated that reliable and robust results can be obtained in both hydrological and hydraulic modelling using remote sensing data as the only input to large scale and sparsely gauged basins. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract explicitly states the use of freely available global datasets, such as TRMM and Jason-2, for hydrological modeling relevant to agriculture.",Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM); Jason-2

Olive (Olea europaea L.) is a global, high value crop currently cultivated in 28 countries worldwide. Global data to assess the vulnerability of the crop to climate variability are scarce, and in some notable cases, such the United Nations Food and Agricutlure Organization database (FAO, 2006), qualitative assessments rather than quantitative indicators are provided. The aim of this study is to demonstrate a new approach to help overcome these constraints toward a globally applicable method to assess the adaptability of olive cultivars. The adaptability of 11 cultivars, widely used in 11 countries worldwide, was studied using a new generic approach based on the evaluation of soil hydrological regime against cultivar-specific hydrological requirements. The approach requires local data, notably on soil hydrological properties, but it is easily transferable to other countries and regions. We applied an agrohydrological model in 60 soil units to determine hydrological indicators both in a reference (1961–1990) and a future (2021–2050) climate case. We compared indicators with cultivar-specific requirements to achieve the target yield; requirements were established using experimental yield response curves. We estimated the probability of adaptation, i.e., the probability that a given cultivar attains the target yield, and we used it to evaluate the cultivar potential distribution in the study area. At the locations where soil hydrological conditions were favorable, the probabilities of adaptation of the cultivars were high in both climate cases. The results show that the area with suitable conditions for the target yield (area of adaptability) decreased under future climate for all the cultivars, with higher reduction for Frantoio and Maiatica and smaller reduction for Itrana, Nocellara, Ascolana, and Kalamata. These cultivars are currently grown in Argentina, United States (US), Australia, France, Greece, and Italy. Our results indicate also that these cultivars require higher available soil water to attain the target yield, i.e., we may expect similar vulnerability in other parts of the world. Based on these findings, we provide some specific recommendations for enrichment of global databases and for further developments of our approach, to increase its potential for global application. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract mentions a global agricultural database (FAO) and discusses the need for global data to assess crop vulnerability, meeting all inclusion criteria.",United Nations Food and Agricutlure Organization database

However, most contemporary air quality models lack a mechanistic representation of the biogeochemical processes that form these gases. They typically use heavily parameterized equations to simulate emissions of NO independently from NH <inf>3</inf> and do not quantify emissions of HONO or N <inf>2</inf> O. This study introduces a mechanistic, process-oriented representation of soil emissions of N species (NO, HONO, N <inf>2</inf> O, and NH <inf>3</inf> ) that we have recently implemented in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The mechanistic scheme accounts for biogeochemical processes for soil N transformations such as mineralization, volatilization, nitrification, and denitrification. The rates of these processes are influenced by soil parameters, meteorology, land use, and mineral N availability. We account for spatial heterogeneity in soil conditions and biome types by using a global dataset for soil carbon (C) and N across terrestrial ecosystems to estimate daily mineral N availability in nonagricultural soils, which was not accounted for in earlier parameterizations for soil NO. Our mechanistic scheme also uses daily year-specific fertilizer use estimates from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC v0509) agricultural model. A soil map with sub-grid biome definitions was used to represent conditions over the continental United States. CMAQ modeling for May and July 2011 shows improvement in model performance in simulated NO <inf>2</inf> columns compared to Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite retrievals for regions where soils are the dominant source of NO emissions. We also assess how the new scheme affects model performance for NO <inf>x</inf> (NO+NO <inf>2</inf> ), fine nitrate (NO <inf>3</inf> ) particulate matter, and ozone observed by various ground-based monitoring networks. Soil NO emissions in the new mechanistic scheme tend to fall between the magnitudes of the previous parametric schemes and display much more spatial heterogeneity.

In this study, we address some of these challenges by applying the TIN‐based Real‐time Integrated Basin Simulator DHM at a nominal resolution of ~88 m in the Río Sonora basin, a regional watershed of ~21,000 km2 in northwest Mexico. First, we generate reliable high‐resolution (1‐km) hydrometeorological forcings by bias correcting reanalysis products with ground observations and applying downscaling routines that use terrain information at high resolution, which is available globally. Second, we develop a strategy to obtain high‐resolution (250‐m) grids of soil parameters by integrating a coarse‐resolution soil map based on the Food and Agriculture Organization classification with recently released high‐resolution global data sets. Third, we apply the model over a decadal period (2004–2013) and use a set of complementary tools, including Taylor diagrams, connectivity analysis, and empirical orthogonal function analysis, to assess its ability to simulate spatial patterns of land surface temperature through comparison with daily remotely sensed products. We find that (i) the hyperresolution‐simulated patterns capture the spatial variability of land surface temperature quite well and (ii) vegetation properties are the major physical factors controlling the discrepancies between simulated and remotely sensed products.

Despite much attention paid to synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer and manure N applications to croplands, spatially explicit, continuous time-series datasets of manure and fertilizer N inputs on pastures and rangelands are lacking. We developed three global gridded datasets at a resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° for the period 1860-2016 (i.e., annual manure N deposition (by grazing animals) rate, synthetic N fertilizer and N manure application rates), by combining annual and 5 arcmin spatial data on pastures and rangelands with country-level statistics on livestock manure, mineral and chemical fertilizers, and land use information for cropland and permanent meadows and pastures. Based on the new data products, we estimated that total N inputs, the sum of manure N deposition, manure N application and fertilizer N application to pastures and rangelands, increased globally from 15 to 101 Tg N yr-1 during 1860-2016. In particular during the period 2000-2016, livestock manure N deposition accounted for 83 % of the total N inputs, whereas manure and fertilizer N application accounted 9 % and 8 %, respectively. At the regional scale, hotspots of manure N deposition remained largely similar during the period 1860-2016 (i.e., southern Asia, Africa and South America); however, hotspots of manure and fertilizer N application shifted from Europe to southern Asia in the early 21st century.

Focusing on maize, the world’s most prevalent staple, this study argues that, as one of the most important resources for rebel groups, maize can have a destabilizing effect on the state’s ability to thwart rebellion. These claims are corroborated statistically on a new time-varying, high-resolution global dataset of staple crop productivity, and then qualitatively through an analysis of archival records on the Mau Mau rebellion.

Here we present three complete pollination networks, along a secondary successional gradient, in critically endangered Renosterveld vegetation within an agri-environment, South Africa. Site selection was based on historical land-use and contemporary vegetation data resulting in a pristine site, a late successional site where agriculture was halted >15 years ago, and an early successional site where agriculture was halted <five years ago. In total, 240 hours of pollinator-plant observations were recorded over a single flowering season. The pristine site was highly specialised in comparison to global datasets - most likely as a result of relative climatic stability through the Quaternary which allowed specialisation to manifest and persist. Both non-pristine sites showed noticeable differences in characteristics when expressed through network indices; however, the early successional site was closer in nature to the pristine site as a result of vegetation structure. Notwithstanding a lack of replication across the successional gradient precluding robust statistical analyses, this study provides important data which allows for the comparison of pollination dynamics in an understudied and vulnerable vegetation type, to plant-pollinator networks at the global and regional scale.

Therefore, both positive and negative correlations between human population and species richness may be expected.

Increased production and consumption of sugar and refined grains over the last 40 years correlates with negative human health outcomes globally: an alarming increase in diseases such as diabetes, overweight and obesity. In addition to these health effects, the Western diet relies on methods of agricultural production that negatively impact ecosystems, increase the use of fossil fuels and boost greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe). Ancestral communities around the world consume a greater variety of plant and animal species (including insects) than Western urban populations, with positive health and environmental outcomes. Processed food, on the other hand, comes at a high environmental cost: it generates high GHGe, accelerates land-use change to support agriculture and intensive livestock activities, and requires huge amounts of water and agrochemicals.

Compared with natural habitat, assemblages in disturbed habitats have more widespread species on average, especially in urban areas and the tropics. All else being equal, this result means that human land use is homogenizing assemblage composition across space. Disturbed habitats show both reduced abundances of narrow-ranged species and increased abundances of widespread species. Our results are very important for biodiversity conservation because narrow-ranged species are typically at higher risk of extinction than widespread species. Furthermore, the shift to more widespread species may also affect ecosystem functioning by reducing both the contribution of rare species and the diversity of species’ responses to environmental changes among local assemblages. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract states the analysis of a 'large, global database' to study the effects of land use, including agriculture, on biodiversity worldwide.",

The recent greening of global lands suggests an increasing trend of terrestrial vegetation growth, but whether or not the peak growth has been globally enhanced still remains unclear. Here, we use two global datasets of gross primary productivity (GPP) and a satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to characterize recent changes in annual peak vegetation growth (that is, GPP <inf>max</inf> and NDVI <inf>max</inf> ). We demonstrate that the peak in the growth of global vegetation has been linearly increasing during the past three decades. About 65% of the NDVI <inf>max</inf> variation is evenly explained by expanding croplands (21%), rising CO <inf>2</inf> (22%) and intensifying nitrogen deposition (22%). The contribution of expanding croplands to the peak growth trend is substantiated by measurements from eddy-flux towers, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and a global database of plant traits, all of which demonstrate that croplands have a higher photosynthetic capacity than other vegetation types. The large contribution of CO <inf>2</inf> is also supported by a meta-analysis of 466 manipulative experiments and 15 terrestrial biosphere models. Furthermore, we show that the contribution of GPP <inf>max</inf> to the change in annual GPP is less in the tropics than in other regions.

A first and critical important step in the implementation of LDN is assessing the current land condition using not only active restoration of degraded land, but also targeting land degradation drivers behind the land degradation process. In a first step to achieve these goals, countries were provided a global dataset for three sub-indicators of land degradation: land cover (LC), land productivity dynamics (LPD) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we report on trends in these sub-indicators for the Entity Republic of Srpska (RS) as a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a key analysis to inform the frame of reference or baseline conditions for the region to evaluate LDN across this region. Global data for LC for the RS indicates a 0.5% loss of forests (6400 ha) over the time period from 2000 to 2010. Of this area, 5000 ha were converted to cropland and an additional 1400 ha was converted to shrubs, grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas. LPD declined over 2.5% (63,500 ha) of the region. SOC declined on land use changed areas by 15.6% (74,609 Mg ha−1) over the same time period. Based on global data, we estimated that 3% of the country is in a degraded state. Based on interviews with local stakeholders in 31 local communities, the primary land degradation drivers were identified and validated by team experts. Depopulation and migration to urban centers were identified as the important underlying drivers of land degradation that most municipalities are facing. The most frequent direct drivers of land degradation across this region were land abandonment, floods, drought, erosion and urbanization. Land abandonment, more specifically, has resulted in conversion of agriculturally productive lands to lands dominated by a wide range of invasive species over the last 25 years. Continued land degradation is underpinned by the lack of understanding by stakeholders of the importance of land as a resource. In evaluating the status, trends and drivers of land degradation for this region, we have identified key areas or “hot spots” that may be targeted for restoration options and may be used to achieve LDN targets by 2030. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"Although the abstract mentions a global dataset provided to countries, the study itself is a case study of the Republic of Srpska, making its focus and data application regional, which violates an exclusion criterion.",

In ecology the trend is averaged by taking monocultures of all species as baseline to evaluate mixtures. This contrasts the “agricultural” view focusing on the most productive species or species combination as baseline to evaluate mixtures. The present study investigates the change of highest rates (maximum) productivities in grasslands and forests with increasing plant (or tree) diversity, and compares these with the average response. Methods: We base our analysis on existing published datasets relating the growth of plant stands (growth rate per land area) to the diversity on the same plot. We use a global dataset (Ellis et al. 2012 and MODIS-data, see Fig. 1), the grassland experiment in Jena (Buchmann et al. 2017), the regional study on forests in Romania and Germany by Bouriaud et al. (2016), and data from the German National Forest inventory (BWI 3, see Fig. 3). In all cases the average response of growth to changes in biodiversity as well as the boundary line of the maximum values was calculated. Results: In both vegetation types a decreasing trend of maximum productivity with any added species emerges, contrasting the average trend that was positive in grassland, but absent in forests. The trend of maximum values was non-significant in grasslands probably due to the fact that not all combinations of species mixtures were available. In temperate forests, maximum productivity decreases significantly by about 10% in regional studies and by 8% at national scale with each added species. Maximum biomass per area was the same for managed and unmanaged conditions. A global assessment of NPP and biodiversity could also not confirm a general positive biodiversity-productivity relationship. Conclusions: Managed grasslands and forests reach highest productivity and volumes at low diversity. Also globally we could not confirm a biodiversity effect on productivity. Despite this, for long-living organisms, such as trees, the incentive for land managers exists to reduce the risk of failure due to climate extremes and diseases by taking a loss in productivity into account and to actively maintain a mixture of species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The abstract explicitly states the use of a 'global dataset (Ellis et al. 2012 and MODIS-data)' alongside regional and national datasets for its analysis of productivity in forests and grasslands.,MODIS

The objective of this work is to study the spatial distribution of SOM in a highly exploited agricultural area in the Baranja Region (Croatia). The spatially dense dataset available (4825 top-soil samples from 0 to 30 cm) allowed to produce reliable SOM maps using geostatistical interpolation kriging algorithms and to study the relationships with possible influencing factors. The interpolation has been conducted by means of two approaches. In one approach, the overall data set is considered for computing a global variogram and performing a direct interpolation of SOM values. In the second approach, the data are stratified according to two different geological and morphogenetic domains, Holocene Domain (HD) and Pleistocene Domain (PD), and a distinct geostatistical analysis is performed in each domain. The results showed that average SOM in the studied region was 2.29%, indicating a future need for adopting sustainable soil management practices in this region. SOM was significantly higher in HD (2.64%) than PD (1.97%) domain. SOM in PD generally had a much lower global variability. Global dataset analysis reveals that regional intrinsic factors prevail over local intrinsic and extrinsic factors in determining SOM spatial patterns. In contrast, the stratified approach can filter the effect of regional variability related to the main geological and geomorphological setting. The structural spatial correlation in PD is weaker than in HD, as manifested by spatial patches of low and high SOM content with smaller extension in PD with respect to HD. The strong relationships between SOM spatial patterns and geological/geomorphological factors suggest the possibility of adopting finer subdivision criteria in future research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The abstract describes a study using a spatially dense dataset from a specific region (Baranja Region, Croatia).

The standard procedure proposed by international organizations consists of a set of indicators (one or more per target) assessed at country level. However, such country scale assessments have only limited potential for regional or national policymaking, because of aggregation and averaging effects, which limit the identification of phenomena, their causal relationships, and their spatial-temporal dynamics. The need thus emerges for defining assessment procedures that go beyond national level aggregation and zoom into local phenomena, while maintaining a link with the approach adopted at the global level for monitoring and reporting the progress toward the meeting of the SDGs. SDG 6 focuses on water resources and aims at achieving safe water and sanitation for all, which are essential to human health, environmental sustainability, and economic prosperity. SDG 6 is evidently interconnected with several other SDGs, and in particular with those focused on food production (SDG2) and other socio-economic activities using water as a production factor. This paper proposes an approach to assess SDG 6, based upon freely available global data sets. The methodology is suitable for both reporting at international level in accordance with approved guidelines proposed by custodian agencies and -more importantly-analyzing the spatial features of the phenomena related to the SDGs and their targets, producing information useful to support effective sustainability oriented policies. The proposed approach is demonstrated for the assessment of the indicator 6.4.1 (Change in water use efficiency) in South and South-East Asia, with the ambition to provide operational solutions timely applicable at the global level by exploiting the ever-increasing availability of spatial information deriving from ongoing exercises in the field of global change. This will allow identifying current and emerging water management issues, such as the areas where strategies are required to increase the availability of water resources, or those necessitating transboundary strategies.

Existing field scale models that track plant growth as well as the fate and transport of applied pesticides lack an integrated sediment transport component. This study sought to address this lack of available modeling tools for researchers and regulators by integrating the sediment and surface flow components of Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems (GLEAMS) model into the mature Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) to create a derivative model named RZWQM-Sed. Previous research identified RZWQM as a quick running, agricultural field scale model that accurately estimated offsite transport of solutes. Unlike other well performing field scale agricultural models, the full source code of RZWQM was available for modification and extension. However, RZWQM lacked a sediment component and thus could not measure all pollutants moving offsite. GLEAMS sedimentation was chosen for integration due to its well documented history, compatibility with the RZWQM codebase, and source code availability. Sensitivity analysis of the RZWQM runoff variables showed that the residual water content, saturated water content, and bubbling pressure from the Brooks-Corey equation had the highest influence for RZWQM followed by the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the non-Brooks-Corey bubbling pressure. Analysis of GLEAMS variables showed the most significant variables are the USLE parameters (cfact, pfact, ksoil) and Manning's N. The latter variable only showed sensitivity at very high surface roughness while the USLE parameters had a linear relationship over the entire domain. The integrated model was calibrated and validated using multiple real-world datasets spanning ranges of space and time.

Because these two data sets used different approaches for generating the cropland data, we further quantified the consistency/difference in cropland areas and temporal changes between both products. Using log-transformed the time-averaged country-level cropland areas, a good linear relationship was found between these two products across different countries. However, only 8% of countries (mostly Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries) showed cropland area difference smaller than 1% between ESA-CCI and FAOSTAT. The cropland areas (without mosaic cropland types) from ESA-CCI are lower than the areas from FAOSTAT in 26% of countries but higher in 66% of countries. The magnitude of the latter difference (i.e. higher estimates of ESA-CCI than FAOSTAT) would be further amplified if crop intensity was taken into account.

Yet, the magnitude and timing of these dynamics are still unclear. We compiled a global data set of 836 paired-sites to quantify temporal SOC changes after grassland-related LUC. In order to discriminate between SOC losses from the initial ecosystem and gains from the secondary one, the post-LUC time series of SOC data was combined with satellite-based net primary production observations as a proxy of carbon input to the soil. Globally, land conversion from either cropland or forest into grassland leads to SOC accumulation; the reverse shows net SOC loss. The SOC response curves vary between different regions. Conversion of cropland to managed grassland results in more SOC accumulation than natural grassland recovery from abandoned cropland. We did not consider the biophysical variables (e.g., climate conditions and soil properties) when fitting the SOC turnover rate into the observation data but analyzed the relationships between the fitted turnover rate and these variables. The SOC turnover rate is significantly correlated with temperature and precipitation (p < 0.05), but not with the clay fraction of soils (p > 0.05).

Nitrogen fertilization decreased soil pH, and increased soil organic carbon (C) and available N contents. Bacterial taxonomic diversity was decreased by N fertilization alone, but was increased by NPK fertilization.

In total, 5023 infiltration curves were collected across all continents in the SWIG database. These data were either provided and quality checked by the scientists who performed the experiments or they were digitized from published articles. Data from 54 different countries were included in the database with major contributions from Iran, China, and the USA. In addition to its extensive geographical coverage, the collected infiltration curves cover research from 1976 to late 2017. Basic information on measurement location and method, soil properties, and land use was gathered along with the infiltration data, making the database valuable for the development of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) for estimating soil hydraulic properties, for the evaluation of infiltration measurement methods, and for developing and validating infiltration models. Soil textural information (clay, silt, and sand content) is available for 3842 out of 5023 infiltration measurements (∼76%) covering nearly all soil USDA textural classes except for the sandy clay and silt classes. Information on land use is available for 76ĝ€% of the experimental sites with agricultural land use as the dominant type (∼40%). We are convinced that the SWIG database will allow for a better parameterization of the infiltration process in land surface models and for testing infiltration models.

Earlier studies suggest that once the optimum growing temperature is exceeded, mean crop yields decline and the variability of yield increases even if interannual climate variability remains unchanged. Here, we use global datasets of maize production and climate variability combined with future temperature projections to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major maize-producing and -exporting countries under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. We find that as the global mean temperature increases, absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, the coefficient of variation (CV) of maize yields increases almost everywhere to values much larger than present-day values. This higher CV is due both to an increase in the SD of yields and a decrease in mean yields. For the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports, the probability that they have simultaneous production losses greater than 10% in any given year is presently virtually zero, but it increases to 7% under 2 °C warming and 86% under 4 °C warming. Our results portend rising instability in global grain trade and international grain prices, affecting especially the ∼800 million people living in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes. They also underscore the urgency of investments in breeding for heat tolerance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The abstract states the use of global datasets of maize production and climate variability to quantify future yield changes.,

J.",2018,"Sowing and harvest dates are a significant source of uncertainty within crop models, especially for regions where high-resolution data are unavailable or, as is the case in future climate runs, where no data are available at all. Global datasets are not always able to distinguish when wheat is grown in tropical and subtropical regions, and they are also often coarse in resolution. South Asia is one such region where large spatial variation means higher-resolution datasets are needed, together with greater clarity for the timing of the main wheat growing season. Agriculture in South Asia is closely associated with the dominating climatological phenomenon, the Asian summer monsoon (ASM). Rice and wheat are two highly important crops for the region, with rice being mainly cultivated in the wet season during the summer monsoon months and wheat during the dry winter. We present a method for estimating the crop sowing and harvest dates for rice and wheat using the ASM onset and retreat. The aim of this method is to provide a more accurate alternative to the global datasets of cropping calendars than is currently available and generate more representative inputs for climate impact assessments. <br><br> We first demonstrate that there is skill in the model prediction of monsoon onset and retreat for two downscaled general circulation models (GCMs) by comparing modelled precipitation with observations. We then calculate and apply sowing and harvest rules for rice and wheat for each simulation to climatological estimates of the monsoon onset and retreat for a present day period. We show that this method reproduces the present day sowing and harvest dates for most parts of India. The application of the method to two future simulations demonstrates that the estimated sowing and harvest dates are successfully modified to ensure that the growing season remains consistent with the internal model climate. The study therefore provides a useful way of modelling potential growing season adaptations to changes in future climate. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The study uses global datasets and downscaled general circulation models (GCMs) to develop a method for estimating crop dates in South Asia.,

As the volume of international trade continues to rise, so does the understanding that trade of water-intensive crops from areas with high precipitation, to arid regions can help mitigate water scarcity, highlighting the importance of crop water accounting. Virtual-Water, or Water-Footprint [WF] of agricultural crops, is a powerful indicator for assessing the extent of water use by plants, contamination of water bodies by agricultural practices and trade between countries, which underlies any international trade of crops. Most available studies of virtual-water flows by import/export of agricultural commodities were based on global databases, which are considered to be of limited accuracy. The present study analyzes the WF of crop production, import, and export on a country level, using Israel as a case study, comparing data from two high-resolution local databases and two global datasets. Results for local datasets demonstrate a WF of ~ 1200 Million Cubic Meters [MCM]/year) for total crop production, ~ 1000 MCM/year for import and ~ 250 MCM/year for export. Fruits and vegetables comprise ~ 80% of Export WF (~ 200 MCM/year), ~ 50% of crop production and only ~ 20% of the imports. Economic Water Productivity [EWP] ($/m3) for fruits and vegetables is 1.5 higher compared to other crops. Moreover, the results based on local and global datasets varied significantly, demonstrating the importance of developing high-resolution local datasets based on local crop coefficients. Performing high resolution WF analysis can help in developing agricultural policies that include support for low WF/high EWP and limit high WF/low EWP crop export, where water availability is limited. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The abstract describes a study on agricultural water use that compares local databases with global datasets.,

The correlation between monthly and seasonal VCI and SPEI (lag months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12) was investigated in a regional and provincial scale. Monthly correlation found to be the highest in the Central Anatolia, Aegean, Marmara and Mediterranean regions respectively, while other regions have lower and non-homogenous values. One lag time of the VCI with respect to SPEI 12 improves the correlation. The regional correlation showed that, the highest correlation between two parameters is obtained for all the regions with SPEI 12 during summer, then followed by Autumn, and Spring months, the maximum values are recorded for the Central Anatolia (0.656) and Mediterranean (0.625) in Summer, and Aegean (0.643) in Autumn respectively; rather lower correlation values did occur in Marmara (0.515) in Autumn, Eastern Anatolia (0.501), SE Anatolia (0.375) and Black Sea (0.297) regions in Summer.

We compare indices of groundwater development stress for three major agricultural areas of the United States to information available from regional water budgets developed from detailed groundwater modeling. These comparisons illustrate the potential value of regional-scale analyses to supplement global hydrological models and GRACE analyses of groundwater depletion. Regional-scale analyses allow assessments of water stress that better account for scale effects, the dynamics of groundwater flow systems, the complexities of irrigated agricultural systems, and the laws, regulations, engineering, and socioeconomic factors that govern groundwater use.

Since cash crops are intended for future sale, they translate into large financial value when considered on a wide geographical scale, so their production directly involves financial risk. At a national level, extreme weather events including destructive rain or hail, as well as drought, can have a significant impact on the overall economic balance. It is thus important to map such crops in order to set up insurance and mitigation strategies. Using locally generated data—such as municipality-level records of crop seeding—for mapping purposes implies facing a series of issues like data availability, quality, homogeneity, etc. We thus opted for a different approach relying on global datasets. Global datasets ensure homogeneity and availability of data, although sometimes at the expense of precision and accuracy. A typical global approach makes use of spaceborne remote sensing, for which different land cover classification strategies are available in literature at different levels of cost and accuracy. We selected the optimal strategy in the perspective of a global processing chain. Thanks to a specifically developed strategy for fusing unsupervised classification results with environmental constraints and other geospatial inputs including ground-based data, we managed to obtain good classification results despite the constraints placed. The overall production process was composed using “good-enough"" algorithms at each step, ensuring that the precision, accuracy, and data-hunger of each algorithm was commensurate to the precision, accuracy, and amount of data available. This paper describes the tailored strategy developed on the occasion as a cooperation among different groups with diverse backgrounds, a strategy which is believed to be profitably reusable in other, similar contexts.

Irrigated areas constitute 40'% of the total area used for agricultural production (FAO, 2014a) Information on their spatial distribution is highly relevant for regional water management and food security. Spatial information on irrigation is highly important for policy and decision makers, who are facing the transition towards more efficient sustainable agriculture. However, the mapping of irrigated areas still represents a challenge for land use classifications, and existing global data sets differ strongly in their results. The following study tests an existing irrigation map based on statistics and extends the irrigated area using ancillary data.

The largest differences compared to the official national statistics are found in Asia and particularly in China and India.

Here we use a global dataset of 80 published plant–pollinator interaction networks as well as pollinator effectiveness measures from 34 plant species to assess the importance of A. mellifera in natural habitats. Apis mellifera is the most frequent floral visitor in natural habitats worldwide, averaging 13% of floral visits across all networks (range 0–85%), with 5% of plant species recorded as being exclusively visited by A. mellifera. For 33% of the networks and 49% of plant species, however, A. mellifera visitation was never observed, illustrating that many flowering plant taxa and assemblages remain dependent on non-A. mellifera visitors for pollination. Apis mellifera visitation was higher in warmer, less variable climates and on mainland rather than island sites, but did not differ between its native and introduced ranges. With respect to single-visit pollination effectiveness, A. mellifera did not differ from the average non-A. mellifera floral visitor, though it was generally less effective than the most effective non-A. mellifera visitor.

It controls the rate of evapotranspiration, and is a key to crop production. It is widely accepted that the available water capacity in soil can be improved by increasing organic matter content. However, the increase in amount of water that is available to plants with an increase in organic matter is still uncertain and may be overestimated. To clarify this issue, we carried out a meta-analysis from 60 published studies and analysed large databases (more than 50 000 measurements globally) to seek relations between organic carbon (OC) and water content at saturation, field capacity, wilting point and available water capacity. We show that the increase in organic carbon in soil has a small effect on soil water content. A 1% mass increase in soil OC (or 10 g C kg−1 soil mineral), on average, increases water content at saturation, field capacity, wilting point and available water capacity by: 2.95, 1.61, 0.17 and 1.16 mm H<inf>2</inf>O 100 mm soil−1, respectively. The increase is larger in sandy soils, followed by loams and is least in clays. Overall the increase in available water capacity is very small; 75% of the studies reported had values between 0.7 and 2 mm 100 mm−1 with an increase of 10 g C kg−1 soil. Compared with reported annual rates of carbon sequestration after the adoption of conservation agricultural systems, the effect on soil available water is negligible. Thus, arguments for sequestering carbon to increase water storage are questionable. Conversely, global warming may cause losses in soil carbon, but the effects on soil water storage and its consequent impact on hydrological cycling might be less than thought previously. Highlights: We investigated how available water capacity can be increased with a 1% increase in soil organic carbon. We analysed data from 60 published studies and global databases with more than 50 000 measurements. The increase in organic carbon in soil has a small effect on soil water retention.

The human impact in the model is based on population density and cropland fraction, which were identified as important drivers of burned area in analyses of global datasets, and are commonly used in global models. After an evaluation of the sensitivity to these two variables we extend the model by including an additional effect of the cropland fraction on the fire duration. The general pattern of human influence is similar in both model versions: the strongest human impact is found in regions with intermediate productivity, where fire occurrence is not limited by fuel load or climatic conditions. Human effects in the model increases burned area in the tropics, while in temperate regions burned area is reduced. While the population density is similar on average for the tropical and temperate regions, the cropland fraction is higher in temperate regions, and leads to a strong suppression of fire. The model shows a low human impact in the boreal region, where both population density and cropland fraction is very low and the climatic conditions, as well as the vegetation productivity limit fire. Previous studies attributed a decrease in fire activity found in global charcoal datasets to human activity. This is confirmed by our simulations, which only show a decrease in burned area when the human influence on fire is accounted for, and not with only natural effects on fires. We assess how the vegetation-fire feedback influences the results, by comparing simulations with dynamic vegetation biogeography to simulations with prescribed vegetation. The vegetation-fire feedback increases the human impact on burned area by 10% for present day conditions.

Using an ongoing experiment in France, we assessed whether two protocols, widely used in international projects and global databases, provide similar estimates of earthworm abundance, and detect the same community responses to agricultural intensification. Method A consisted of hand-sorting composite samples of three soil monoliths 35 × 35 × 20 cm each, and applying formalin in the resulting holes. Method B consisted of applying formalin over a 1 m2 contiguous area and subsequently hand-sorting a 25 × 25 × 25 cm soil monolith within it. Higher abundance was obtained from Method A than from Method B, but the two methods led to the same ecological conclusions. Firstly, they both showed that earthworm biomass and density decreased with agricultural intensification. Secondly, they showed similar land use effects on earthworm ecological group proportions, age structure, and body size distribution, pointing to a relative loss of large-bodied earthworms with agricultural intensification.

Both patterns of historical (approximately 4000 B.C. - 2000 A.D.) and recent (1990-2005) deforestation were explored and compared. The study uses location analysis, combining spatially explicit global databases of deforestation with variables hypothesized to relate to deforestation (e.g. rural livestock density, cost-distance). The results show that historical and recent deforestation show similar patterns when plotted against the selected variables suggesting the relations to be empirical. The strongest relations were between deforestation and rural population density, cost-distance and crop suitability respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that agricultural expansion was the largest direct cause of deforestation historically and it continues to be the largest direct cause today. While crop suitability showed a strong correlation with deforestation, pasture suitability showed no correlation. The study accordingly compares contemporary deforestation in the tropical domain against economic development (approximated by a combination of GDP value and growth rate) which resulted in a reproduction of the deforestation pattern predicted by the forest transition curve. In view of the apparent empirical relation, the variables which relate to deforestation in this study are expected to have predictive power to identify locations of likely future deforestation. To illustrate the application value of this analysis, the deforestation risk in African protected forest was assessed. This assessment revealed that protected areas are found on locations with below average pressure and the pressures vary greatly in the different regions. The findings underline the importance of considering national circumstances to understand the government's efforts to manage its forests sustainably and contribute to international mitigation by reducing forest-related emissions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The study uses spatially explicit global databases to analyze deforestation patterns, which it links directly to agricultural expansion.",

Numerous processes drive the global spatial distribution of P in agricultural soils, but their relative roles remain unclear. Here, we combined several global data sets describing these drivers with a soil P dynamics model to simulate the distribution of P in agricultural soils and to assess the contributions of the different drivers at the global scale. We analysed both the labile inorganic P (P<inf>ILAB</inf>), a proxy of the pool involved in plant nutrition and the total soil P (P<inf>TOT</inf>). We found that the soil biogeochemical background corresponding to P inherited from natural soils at the conversion to agriculture (BIOG) and farming practices (FARM) were the main drivers of the spatial variability in cropland soil P content but that their contribution varied between P<inf>TOT</inf> vs. P<inf>ILAB</inf>. When the spatial variability was computed between grid cells at half-degree resolution, we found that almost all of the P<inf>TOT</inf> spatial variability could be explained by BIOG, while BIOG and FARM explained 38% and 63% of P<inf>ILAB</inf> spatial variability, respectively. Our work also showed that the driver contribution was sensitive to the spatial scale characterizing the variability (grid cell vs. continent) and to the region of interest (global vs. tropics for instance). In particular, the heterogeneity of farming practices between continents was large enough to make FARM contribute to the variability in P<inf>TOT</inf> at that scale. We thus demonstrated how the different drivers were combined to explain the global distribution of agricultural soil P. Our study is also a promising approach to investigate the potential effect of P as a limiting factor for agroecosystems at the global scale. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper combines several global datasets to simulate the distribution of phosphorus in agricultural soils at a global scale, meeting all criteria.",

Martin",2017,"While we know that deforestation in the tropics is increasingly driven by commercial agriculture, most tropical countries still lack recent and spatially-explicit assessments of the relative importance of pasture and cropland expansion in causing forest loss. Here we present a spatially explicit quantification of the extent to which cultivated land and grassland expanded at the expense of forests across Latin America in 2001-2011, by combining two -state-ofthe-art- global datasets (Global Forest Change forest loss and GlobeLand30-2010 land cover). We further evaluate some of the limitations and challenges in doing this. We find that this approach does capture some of the major patterns of land cover following deforestation, with GlobeLand30-2010-s Grassland class (which we interpret as pasture) being the most common land cover replacing forests across Latin America. However, our analysis also reveals some major limitations to combining these land cover datasets for quantifying pasture and cropland expansion into forest. First, a simple one-to-one translation between GlobeLand30-2010-s Cultivated land and Grassland classes into cropland and pasture respectively, should not be made without caution, as GlobeLand30-2010 defines its Cultivated land to include some pastures. Comparisons with the TerraClass dataset over the Brazilian Amazon and with previous literature indicates that Cultivated land in GlobeLand30-2010 includes notable amounts of pasture and other vegetation (e.g. in Paraguay and the Brazilian Amazon). This further suggests that the approach taken here generally leads to an underestimation (of up to ~60%) of the role of pasture in replacing forest. Second, a large share (~33%) of the Global Forest Change forest loss is found to still be forest according to GlobeLand30-2010 and our analysis suggests that the accuracy of the combined datasets, especially for areas with heterogeneous land cover and/or small-scale forest loss, is still too poor for deriving accurate quantifications of land cover following forest loss. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper explicitly mentions combining two global datasets, Global Forest Change and GlobeLand30-2010, to study agricultural expansion.",Global Forest Change;GlobeLand30-2010;TerraClass

Using a comprehensive global database and parsimonious modelling, we evaluate the impact of anthropogenic soil erosion on C fluxes between the Earth's surface and atmosphere from the onset of agriculture to the present day. We find that agricultural erosion represents a very large and transient perturbation to the C cycle and has induced a cumulative net uptake of 78 ± 22 Pg C in terrestrial ecosystems during the period 6000 BC to AD 2015. This erosion-induced soil organic C sink is estimated to have offset 37 ± 10% of previously recognized C emissions resulting from ALCC. We estimate that rates of C burial have increased by a factor of 4.6 since AD 1850. Thus, current assessments may significantly overestimate both past and future anthropogenic emissions from the land.

Here we provide a plausible breakdown of global agricultural and nutrient production by farm size, and also study the associations between farm size, agricultural diversity, and nutrient production. This analysis is crucial to design interventions that might be appropriately targeted to promote healthy diets and ecosystems in the face of population growth, urbanisation, and climate change. Methods We used existing spatially-explicit global datasets to estimate the production levels of 41 major crops, seven livestock, and 14 aquaculture and fish products. From overall production estimates, we estimated the production of vitamin A, vitamin B<inf>12</inf>, folate, iron, zinc, calcium, calories, and protein. We also estimated the relative contribution of farms of different sizes to the production of different agricultural commodities and associated nutrients, as well as how the diversity of food production based on the number of different products grown per geographic pixel and distribution of products within this pixel (Shannon diversity index [H]) changes with different farm sizes. Findings Globally, small and medium farms (≤50 ha) produce 51–77% of nearly all commodities and nutrients examined here. However, important regional differences exist. Large farms (>50 ha) dominate production in North America, South America, and Australia and New Zealand. In these regions, large farms contribute between 75% and 100% of all cereal, livestock, and fruit production, and the pattern is similar for other commodity groups. By contrast, small farms (≤20 ha) produce more than 75% of most food commodities in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, south Asia, and China. In Europe, west Asia and north Africa, and central America, medium-size farms (20–50 ha) also contribute substantially to the production of most food commodities. Very small farms (≤2 ha) are important and have local significance in sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia, and south Asia, where they contribute to about 30% of most food commodities. The majority of vegetables (81%), roots and tubers (72%), pulses (67%), fruits (66%), fish and livestock products (60%), and cereals (56%) are produced in diverse landscapes (H>1·5). Similarly, the majority of global micronutrients (53–81%) and protein (57%) are also produced in more diverse agricultural landscapes (H>1·5). By contrast, the majority of sugar (73%) and oil crops (57%) are produced in less diverse ones (H≤1·5), which also account for the majority of global calorie production (56%). The diversity of agricultural and nutrient production diminishes as farm size increases. However, areas of the world with higher agricultural diversity produce more nutrients, irrespective of farm size. Interpretation Our results show that farm size and diversity of agricultural production vary substantially across regions and are key structural determinants of food and nutrient production that need to be considered in plans to meet social, economic, and environmental targets. At the global level, both small and large farms have key roles in food and nutrition security. Efforts to maintain production diversity as farm sizes increase seem to be necessary to maintain the production of diverse nutrients and viable, multifunctional, sustainable landscapes.

Understanding its implications for natural and cultivated ecosystems is pivotal in a context of high population growth and mainly agriculture-based livelihoods. However, efforts to model processes at the land–atmosphere interface are hindered, particularly when the multi-decadal timescale is targeted, as climatic data are scarce, largely incomplete and often unreliable. This study presents the generation of a long-term, high-temporal resolution, multivariate local climatic data set for Niamey, Central Sahel. The continuous series spans the period 1950–2009 at a 30-min timescale and includes ground station-based meteorological variables (precipitation, air temperature, relative and specific humidity, air pressure, wind speed, downwelling long- and short-wave radiation) as well as process-modelled surface fluxes (upwelling long- and short-wave radiation, latent, sensible and soil heat fluxes and surface temperature). A combination of complementary techniques (linear/spline regressions, a multivariate analogue method, artificial neural networks and recursive gap filling) was used to reconstruct missing meteorological data. The complete surface energy budget was then obtained for two dominant land cover types, fallow bush and millet, by applying the meteorological forcing data set to a finely field-calibrated land surface model. Uncertainty in reconstructed data was expressed by means of a stochastic ensemble of plausible historical time series.

Profile depth functions have been used to represent the vertical distribution of soil attributes and to predict them at continuous depths. This paper proposes a new model to predict pH for a whole soil profile. Soil properties including pH are often similar within the plow layer from mixing during tillage and other agricultural operations. Similarly, soil pH below the root zone tends to be uniform due to low disturbance, leaving a transition zone from the bottom of the tillage layer to the bottom of the root zone due to depth-dependent root density and related soil processes. Keeping this physical description of agricultural field soil profile in mind, a closed form equation (model) was developed similar to a sigmoid curve. The model has 4 parameters including 1) soil pH at the top of a soil profile, 2) soil pH at the bottom of a soil profile, 3) hillslope parameter representing steepness of the curve that is determined by the length of the root zone, and 4) inflection point representing almost the midpoint of the transition zone or root zone. A total of 32 soil cores down to about 1.1 m depths were collected from an agricultural field of Macdonald farm, McGill University. The sub-samples were taken at every 10 cm and analyzed for soil pH in soil: water suspension in the laboratory. The measured pH was used to test the fitting performance of the sigmoid model. Additionally, a global dataset with 432 profiles with various soil classes, drainage types, land use, and altitude was also used to test the generality of the new model. The performance of this model was compared with the results of the commonly used 3rd order polynomial regression function and the equal-area quadratic spline function. Good performance of the sigmoid model with explicit physical explanation showed promise in predicting soil pH at depths. The spline function had the highest accuracy but lacked a general trend in its shape and parameters. The polynomial function had good accuracy and displayed a non-monotonic trend, which can also be used as a substitute for some profiles with complex variability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper uses a global dataset of soil profiles, in addition to local samples, to test a new model for predicting soil pH.",

This paper provides a method for constructing a new historical global nitrogen fertilizer application map (0.5° × 0.5° resolution) for the period 1961-2010 based on country-specific information from Food and Agriculture Organization statistics (FAOSTAT) and various global datasets. This new map incorporates the fraction of NH<inf>4</inf>+ (and NO<inf>3</inf>) in N fertilizer inputs by utilizing fertilizer species information in FAOSTAT, in which species can be categorized as NH<inf>4</inf>+and/or NO<inf>3</inf>-forming N fertilizers. During data processing, we applied a statistical data imputation method for the missing data (19ĝ of national N fertilizer consumption) in FAOSTAT. The multiple imputation method enabled us to fill gaps in the time-series data using plausible values using covariates information (year, population, GDP, and crop area). After the imputation, we downscaled the national consumption data to a gridded cropland map. Also, we applied the multiple imputation method to the available chemical fertilizer species consumption, allowing for the estimation of the NH<inf>4</inf>+/NO<inf>3</inf> ratio in national fertilizer consumption. In this study, the synthetic N fertilizer inputs in 2000 showed a general consistency with the existing N fertilizer map (Potter et al., 2010) in relation to the ranges of N fertilizer inputs. Globally, the estimated N fertilizer inputs based on the sum of filled data increased from 15 to 110Tg-N during 1961-2010.

We carried out a WFA to calculate the water footprint (WF) related to soybean production, Glycine max, to understand the sustainability of the WF in the Tapajós river basin, a region in the Brazilian Amazon with large expansion and intensification of soybean. Based on global datasets, environmental hotspots — potentially unsustainable WF areas — were identified and spatially plotted in both baseline scenario (2010) and projection into 2050 through the use of a land-use change scenario that includes climate change effects. Results show green and grey WF values in 2050 increased by 304% and 268%, respectively. More than one-third of the watersheds doubled their grey WF in 2050. Soybean production in 2010 lies within sustainability limits. However, current soybean expansion and intensification trends lead to large impacts in relation to water pollution and water use, affecting protected areas. Areas not impacted in terms of water pollution dropped by 20.6% in 2050 for the whole catchment, while unsustainability increased 8.1%. Management practices such as water consumption regulations to stimulate efficient water use, reduction of crop water use and evapotranspiration, and optimal fertiliser application control could be key factors in achieving sustainability within a river basin. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The study is based on global datasets to assess the water footprint of soybean production and agricultural expansion in the Amazon.,

In this study, we assessed the universality of the relationships between crop LAI and remotely sensed Vegetation Indices (VIs). We first compiled a global dataset of 1459 in situ quality-controlled crop LAI measurements and collected Landsat satellite images to derive five different VIs including Simple Ratio (SR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), two versions of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI and EVI2), and Green Chlorophyll Index (CI<inf>Green</inf>). Based on this dataset, we developed global LAI-VI relationships for each crop type and VI using symbolic regression and Theil-Sen (TS) robust estimator. Results suggest that the global LAI-VI relationships are statistically significant, crop-specific, and mostly non-linear. These relationships explain more than half of the total variance in ground LAI observations (R2 > 0.5), and provide LAI estimates with RMSE below 1.2 m2/m2. Among the five VIs, EVI/EVI2 are the most effective, and the crop-specific LAI-EVI and LAI-EVI2 relationships constructed by TS, are robust when tested by three independent validation datasets of varied spatial scales. While the heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes leads to a diverse set of local LAI-VI relationships, the relationships provided here represent global universality on an average basis, allowing the generation of large-scale spatial-explicit LAI maps.

Bhutan’s complex, often high-altitude terrain and the severe impact of the Indian summer monsoon leads to a strong exposure of the countries’ key economic sectors (agriculture, forestry, hydropower generation and tourism) to climatic changes. Climate change also threatens Bhutan’s vast biodiversity and increases the likelihood of natural hazards (e.g. glacier lake outburst floods, flash floods, droughts and forest fires). A better understanding of Bhutan’s climate and its variability, as well as observed and possible climate impacts, will help in improving the handling of regional social, economic and ecologic challenges not limited to the Himalayas. Only a few climatological studies exist for the eastern Himalayas. They mainly focus on adaptation to immediate threats by glacier lake outbursts. In contrast, this paper (1) investigates the average spatial and inner-annual diversity of the air temperature regime of Bhutan, based on local meteorological observations, (2) discusses past temperature variability, based on global datasets, and (3) relates effects of observed warming to water availability, hydropower development, natural hazards, forests, biodiversity, agriculture, human health and tourism in the Bhutan Himalayas.

The reshaping and migration northwards of bioclimatic zones may offer opportunities for agricultural development in western and central Siberia. However, the bioclimatic vegetation models currently employed for projections still do not consider soil fertility, in spite of this being highly critical for plant growth. In the present study, we surveyed the phosphorus (P) status in the south-west of Siberia where soils have developed on loess parent material. We selected six sites differing in pedoclimatic conditions and the soil was sampled at different depths down to 1ĝ€m in aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> L.) forest as well as in grassland areas. The P status was assessed by conventional methods and by isotope dilution kinetics. We found that P concentrations and stocks, as well as their distribution through the soil profile, were fairly homogeneous on the regional scale studied, although there were some differences between sites (particularly in organic P). The young age of the soils, together with slow kinetics of soil formation processes have probably not yet resulted in a sufficiently wide range of soil physico-chemical conditions to observe a more diverging P status. The comparison of our data set with similar vegetation contexts on the global scale revealed that the soils of south-western Siberia, and more generally of northern Eurasia, often have (very) high levels of total, organic and inorganic P. The amount of plant-available P in topsoils, estimated by the isotopically exchangeable phosphate ions, was not particularly high but was intermediate on the global scale. However, large stocks of plant-available P are stored in subsurface layers which currently have low fine-root exploration intensities. These results suggest that the P resource is unlikely to constrain vegetation growth and agricultural development under the present conditions or in the near future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The abstract mentions comparing soil data from Siberia with a global data set in the context of agricultural development.,

Using a 6-year monitoring of three potato moth species, major crop pests in the tropical Andes, we asked whether the spatiotemporal resolution of temperature data affect the predictions of models of moth performance and distribution. For this, we used three different climatic data sets: (i) the WorldClim dataset (global dataset), (ii) air temperature recorded using data loggers (weather station dataset), and (iii) air crop canopy temperature (microclimate dataset). We developed a statistical procedure to calibrate all datasets to monthly and yearly variation in temperatures, while keeping both spatial and temporal variances (air monthly temperature at 1 km2 for the WorldClim dataset, air hourly temperature for the weather station, and air minute temperature over 250 m radius disks for the microclimate dataset). Then, we computed pest performances based on these three datasets. Results for temperature ranging from 9 to 11°C revealed discrepancies in the simulation outputs in both survival and development rates depending on the spatiotemporal resolution of the temperature dataset. Temperature and simulated pest performances were then combined into multiple linear regression models to compare predicted vs. field data. We used an additional set of study sites to test the ability of the results of our model to be extrapolated over larger scales. Results showed that the model implemented with microclimatic data best predicted observed pest abundances for our study sites, but was less accurate than the global dataset model when performed at larger scales. Our simulations therefore stress the importance to consider different temperature datasets depending on the issue to be solved in order to accurately predict species abundances. In conclusion, keeping in mind that the mismatch between the size of organisms and the scale at which climate data are collected and modeled remains a key issue, temperature dataset selection should be balanced by the desired output spatiotemporal scale for better predicting pest dynamics and developing efficient pest management strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The abstract explicitly states the use of the WorldClim global dataset to model the abundance of crop pests.,WorldClim

This has been the major motivation behind the development of the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, which has been extensively used since its first publication in 2007. The database relies on a downscaling methodology whereby census counts of animals in sub-national administrative units are redistributed at the level of grid cells as a function of a series of spatial covariates. The recent upgrade of GLW1 to GLW2 involved automating the processing, improvement of input data, and down-scaling at a spatial resolution of 1 km per cell (5 km per cell in the earlier version). The underlying statistical methodology, however, remained unchanged. In this paper, we evaluate new methods to downscale census data with a higher accuracy and increased processing efficiency. Two main factors were evaluated, based on sample census datasets of cattle in Africa and chickens in Asia. First, we implemented and evaluated Random Forest models (RF) instead of stratified regressions. Second, we investigated whether models that predicted the number of animals per rural person (per capita) could provide better downscaled estimates than the previous approach that predicted absolute densities (animals per km2). RF models consistently provided better predictions than the stratified regressions for both continents and species. The benefit of per capita over absolute density models varied according to the species and continent. In addition, different technical options were evaluated to reduce the processing time while maintaining their predictive power. Future GLW runs (GLW 3.0) will apply the new RF methodology with optimized modelling options. The potential benefit of per capita models will need to be further investigated with a better distinction between rural and agricultural populations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper focuses on improving the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, which is a global agricultural dataset.",Gridded Livestock of the World
10.1016/j.rse.2015.10.032,Suitability of Global Forest Change data to report forest cover estimates at national level in Gabon,"C.A.D., Sannier, Christophe A.D.; R.E., Mcroberts, Ronald E.; L.V., Fichet, Louis Vincent",2016,"For purposes of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) accounting, estimation of deforestation area in tropical countries often relies on satellite remote sensing in the absence of National Forest Inventories (NFI). Gabon has recently launched a National Climate Action Plan with the intent of establishing a National Forest Monitoring System that meets the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 guidelines for the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. The assessment of areas of forest cover and forest cover change is essential to estimate activity data, defined as areas of various categories of land use change by the IPCC guidelines.An appropriately designed probability sample can be used to estimate forest cover and net change and their associated uncertainties and express them in the form of confidence intervals at selected probability thresholds as required in the IPCC 2006 guidelines and for reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, wall-to-wall mapping is often required to provide a comprehensive assessment of forest resources and as input to land use plans for management purposes, but wall-to-wall approaches are more expensive than a sample based approach based on visual interpretation and require specialized equipment and staff. The recent release of the University of Maryland (UMD) Global Forest Change (GFC) map products could be an alternative for tropical countries wishing to develop their own wall-to-wall forest map products but without the resources to do so. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of replacing national wall-to-wall forest maps with forest maps obtained from the UMD GFC initiative.A model assisted regression (MAR) estimator was applied using the combination of reference data obtained from a probability sample and forest cover and forest cover change maps either (i) produced nationally or (ii) obtained from the UMD GFC data. The resulting activity data are potentially more accurate than the SRS estimate and provide an assessment of the precision of the estimate which is not available from map accuracy indices alone. Results obtained for 2000 and 2010 for both the national and UMD GFC datasets confirm the high level of forest cover in Gabon, more than 23.5 million ha representing approximately 88.5% of the country.Although the UMD GFC dataset provides a reliable means of producing area statistics at national level combined with appropriate sample reference data, thus offering an alternative to nationally produced datasets (i) the classification errors associated with the Global dataset have non-negligible effects on both the estimate and the precision which supports the more general statement that map data should not be used alone to produce area estimates, and (ii) the maps obtained from the UMD GFC dataset require specific calibration of the tree cover percentage representing a non-negligible effort requiring specialized staff and equipment. Guidelines on how to use and further improve UMD GFC maps for national reporting are suggested.

While a wealth of data exists from high latitude regions, little is known on the amount and composition of nutrient fluxes from densely populated tropical catchments. The South Indian Pamba River is a prime example in this respect because of its manifold human interventions such as the Sabarimala pilgrimage, the largest pilgrim centre in the world and agricultural practices. In order (i) to identify direct cause-effect relationships, (ii) to quantify land use specific nutrient inputs and (iii) to assess the respective impacts water was sampled along the river course during the pre monsoon, south west monsoon and north east monsoon periods in 2010 to 2012. Sampling segments were chosen according to prevailing land use. A socioeconomic survey on agricultural practices was conducted to collect information on the type, time and quantity of fertilizer application. Our results indicate (i) little human activities in the forest segment resulted in a low nutrient yield; (ii) pilgrim activities led to high ammonium and phosphate yields in the temple segment; (iii) specific fertilizer management resulted in moderate and maximum nitrate yields in the respective agriculture segments. Annual NPK fertilizer inputs to the catchment were 95 kg ha− 1 yr− 1.The average yield for the Pamba River catchment amounted to 3.5 kg ha− 1 yr− 1 of DIN and 0.2 kg ha− 1 yr− 1 of phosphate-P.

Improved management of agricultural water is important because agriculture is the dominant user of fresh water. Estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) using satellite imagery is regarded as an effective tool for improving agricultural water management. This paper presents the progress made in the development of a global Evapotranspiration-Index (ET<inf>index</inf>) estimation algorithm that is applicable to Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) satellite observation. The algorithm computes an ET-related indicator that is termed the ET<inf>index</inf>. The primary input data are thermal observation data from the satellite and near-surface wind speed data from a global climate model. The ET<inf>index</inf> is equivalent to the crop coefficient, which has been applied widely for agricultural and irrigation water management around the globe. As a result, the ET<inf>index</inf> maps have congruency with traditional agricultural water management methodologies, although the application targets of the ET<inf>index</inf> are not limited to irrigation or agriculture. The algorithm estimates the ET<inf>index</inf> by analyzing the relative position of actual surface temperature between two extreme surface conditions (wet and dry conditions). Estimation of the wet and dry surface temperatures is a key component of the algorithm. The developed model represents the wet and dry surface temperatures with less than 1℃ bias and less than 6℃ random error in Shenmu, China. The simple structure of the algorithm is designed to process global data with limited computational load.

In forensic science the stable isotope ratios of human remains such as hair and nail are used for geographical allocation. Thus, knowledge of the global spatial distribution of human δ13C and δ15N values is an essential component in the interpretation of stable isotope analytical results. Methods No substantial global datasets of human stable isotope ratios are currently available, although the amount of available (published) data has increased within recent years. We have herein summarised the published data on human global δ13C andδ15N values (around 3600 samples) and added experimental values of more than 400 additional worldwide human hair and nail samples. In order to summarise isotope ratios for hair and nail samples correction factors were determined. Results The current available dataset of human stable isotope ratios is biased towards Europe and North America with only limited data for countries in Africa, Central and South America and Southeast Asia. The global spatial distribution of carbon isotopes is related to latitude and supports the fact that human δ13C values are dominated by the amount of C<inf>4</inf> plants in the diet, either due to direct ingestion as plant food, or by its use as animal feed. In contrast, the global spatial distribution of human δ15N values is apparently not exclusively related to the amount of fish or meat ingested, but also to environmental factors that influence agricultural production. Conclusions There are still a large proportion of countries, especially in Africa, where there are no available data for human carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios.

A crop calendar (CC), which defines the date or month when farmers sow and harvest crops, is an essential input for the numerical estimations. This study aims to present a new global data set, the SAtellite-derived CRop calendar for Agricultural simulations (SACRA), and to discuss advantages and disadvantages compared to existing census-based and model-derived products. We estimate global CC at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin using satellite-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, which corresponds to vegetation vitality and senescence on the land surface. Using the time series of the NDVI averaged from three consecutive years (2004-2006), sowing/harvesting dates are estimated for six crops (temperate-wheat, snow-wheat, maize, rice, soybean and cotton). We assume time series of the NDVI represent the phenology of one dominant crop and estimate CCs of the dominant crop in each grid. The dominant crops are determined using harvested areas based on census-based data. The cultivation period of SACRA is identified from the time series of the NDVI; therefore, SACRA considers current effects of human decisions and natural disasters. The difference between the estimated sowing dates and other existing products is less than 2 months (< 62 days) in most of the areas. A major disadvantage of our method is that the mixture of several crops in a grid is not considered in SACRA. The assumption of one dominant crop in each grid is a major source of discrepancy in crop calendars between SACRA and other products. The disadvantages of our approach may be reduced with future improvements based on finer satellite sensors and crop-type classification studies to consider several dominant crops in each grid. The comparison of the CC also demonstrates that identification of wheat type (sowing in spring or fall) is a major source of error in global CC estimations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The paper presents a new global dataset named SAtellite-derived CRop calendar for Agricultural simulations (SACRA).,SAtellite-derived CRop calendar for Agricultural simulations (SACRA)

The results provide evidence that the presence of SEM in certain dairy ingredients (whey, milk protein concentrates) is a by-product of chemical reactions taking place during the manufacturing process. Of the dairy ingredients tested (c. 2000 samples), 5.3% showed traces of SEM > 0.5 µg/kg. The highest incidence of SEM-positive samples in the dairy category were whey (powders, liquid) and milk protein concentrates (35% positive), with up to 13 µg/kg measured in a whey powder.

However, no-till (NT), a fundamental component of CA, has been shown to reduce yields in many cases. In order to maintain yields following adoption of CA, it has been recently suggested that fertilizer application should be an integral component of CA. To determine the contribution of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in minimizing yield declines following NT implementation, we assessed 2759 paired comparisons of NT and conventional tillage (CT) systems from 325 studies reported in the peer-reviewed literature between 1980 and 2013. Overall, we found that NT yields decreased -10.7% (-14.8% to -6.5%) and -3.7% (-5.3% to -2.2%) relative to CT in tropical/subtropical and temperate regions, respectively. Among management and environmental variables that included: the rate of N fertilization; the duration of the NT/CT comparison; residue, rotation, and irrigation practices; the crop type; and the site aridity, N rate was the most important explanatory variable for NT yield declines in tropical/subtropical regions. In temperate regions, N fertilization rates were relatively less important. NT yield declines were most consistently observed at low rates of N fertilization during the first 2 years of NT adoption in tropical/subtropical regions. Applications of N fertilizer at rates of up to 85±12kgNha-1yr-1 significantly reduced NT yield declines in these scenarios. While this result should not be viewed as a rate recommendation, it does suggest that farmers applying rates of N fertilizer that are low for their specific system will, on average, see higher NT yields if they increase application rates. In addition, when crop rotation was not practiced or residues were removed from the field, NT yield declines were magnified by low rates of N fertilization in tropical/subtropical regions. These results, based on a global data set and across a broad range of crops, highlight the importance of N fertilization in counteracting yield declines in NT systems, particularly in tropical/subtropical regions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The study is based on a global dataset compiled from 325 peer-reviewed studies to analyze tillage and fertilization practices in agriculture.,

The harmonization and improvement of regional emission inventories is imperative to obtain consolidated estimates on the formation of global-scale air pollution. An emissions data set has been constructed using regional emission grid maps (annual and monthly) for SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, NH3, PM10, PM2.5, BC and OC for the years 2008 and 2010, with the purpose of providing consistent information to global and regional scale modelling efforts. This compilation of different regional gridded inventories-including that of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for USA, the EPA and Environment Canada (for Canada), the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) and Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) for Europe, and the Model Inter-comparison Study for Asia (MICS-Asia III) for China, India and other Asian countries-was gap-filled with the emission grid maps of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv4.3) for the rest of the world (mainly South America, Africa, Russia and Oceania). Emissions from seven main categories of human activities (power, industry, residential, agriculture, ground transport, aviation and shipping) were estimated and spatially distributed on a common grid of 0.1° × 0.1° longitude-latitude, to yield monthly, global, sector-specific grid maps for each substance and year. The HTAP-v2.2 air pollutant grid maps are considered to combine latest available regional information within a complete global data set. The disaggregation by sectors, high spatial and temporal resolution and detailed information on the data sources and references used will provide the user the required transparency. Because HTAP-v2.2 contains primarily official and/or widely used regional emission grid maps, it can be recommended as a global baseline emission inventory, which is regionally accepted as a reference and from which different scenarios assessing emission reduction policies at a global scale could start. An analysis of country-specific implied emission factors shows a large difference between industrialised countries and developing countries for acidifying gaseous air pollutant emissions (SO2 and NOx) from the energy and industry sectors. This is not observed for the particulate matter emissions (PM10, PM2.5), which show large differences between countries in the residential sector instead. The per capita emissions of all world countries, classified from low to high income, reveal an increase in level and in variation for gaseous acidifying pollutants, but not for aerosols. For aerosols, an opposite trend is apparent with higher per capita emissions of particulate matter for low income countries. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The paper describes the construction of a global emission grid map dataset (HTAP-v2.2) that includes emissions from the agriculture sector.,HTAP-v2.2; Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv4.3)

Forest loss at a global scale has been unveiled with increasingly finer spatial resolution, but the forest extent and loss in protected areas (PAs) and in large intact forest landscapes (IFLs) have not so far been systematically assessed. Moreover, the impact of protection on preserving the IFLs is not well understood. In this study we conducted a consistent assessment of the global forest loss in PAs and IFLs over the period 2000-2012.We used recently published global remote sensing based spatial forest cover change data, being a uniform and consistent dataset over space and time, together with global datasets on PAs' and IFLs' locations. Our analyses revealed that on a global scale 3%of the protected forest, 2.5% of the intact forest, and 1.5%of the protected intact forest were lost during the study period. These forest loss rates are relatively high compared to global total forest loss of 5% for the same time period. The variation in forest losses and in protection effect was large among geographical regions and countries. In some regions the loss in protected forests exceeded 5% (e.g. in Australia and Oceania, and North America) and the relative forest loss was higher inside protected areas than outside those areas (e.g. inMongolia and parts of Africa, Central Asia, and Europe). At the same time, protection was found to prevent forest loss in several countries (e.g. in South America and Southeast Asia). Globally, high areaweighted forest loss rates of protected and intact forests were associated with high gross domestic product and in the case of protected forests also with high proportions of agricultural land. Our findings reinforce the need for improved understanding of the reasons for the high forest losses in PAs and IFLs and strategies to prevent further losses. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper conducts a global analysis using global remote sensing data on forest cover change, which is related to land use and agriculture.",

State agricultural data were collected and applied to commodity production statistics. Indices were created to allow a comparison of the resource requirements for each dietary pattern. Setting California, USA. Subjects None. Results The diet containing more animal products required an additional 10 252 litres of water, 9910 kJ of energy, 186 g of fertilizer and 6 g of pesticides per week in comparison to the diet containing less animal products. The greatest contribution to the difference came from the consumption of animal products, particularly beef.

Such areas have a “yield gap” between the crop yields they achieve and the crop yields that could be achieved under more intensive management. Crop yield gaps have received increased attention in recent years due to concerns over land scarcity, stagnating crop yield trends in some important agricultural areas, and large projected increases in food demand. Recent analyses of global data sets and results from ½eld trials have improved our understanding of where yield gaps exist and their potential contribution to increasing the food supply. Achieving yield gap closure is a complex task: while agronomic approaches to closing yield gaps are generally well-known, a variety of social, political, and economic factors allow them to persist.

A recent phenomenon in which climate change may play an important role is the acquisition of large tracts of land in the developing world by governments and corporations. In the target countries, where land is relatively inexpensive, the potential to increase crop yields is generally high and property rights are often poorly defined. By acquiring land, investors can realize large profits and countries can substantially alter the land and water resources under their control, thereby changing their outlook for meeting future demand. While the drivers, actors, and impacts involved with land deals have received substantial attention in the literature, we propose that climate change plays an important yet underappreciated role, both through its direct effects on agricultural production and through its influence on mitigative or adaptive policy decisions. Drawing from various literature sources as well as a new global database on reported land deals, we trace the evolution of the global land rush and highlight prominent examples in which the role of climate change is evident. We find that climate change - both historical and anticipated - interacts substantially with drivers of land acquisitions, having important implications for the resilience of communities in targeted areas. As a result of this synthesis, we ultimately contend that considerations of climate change should be integrated into future policy decisions relating to the large-scale land acquisitions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper draws from a new global database on reported land deals, which are often related to agriculture and food production.",

A.",2015,"We estimated the net ecosystem carbon (C) balance (NECB) of a temperate pasture in the North Island of New Zealand for four years (2008-2011). The pasture was intensively managed with addition of fertiliser and year-round rotational grazing by dairy cows. Climatic conditions and management practices had a large impact on CO<inf>2</inf> exchange, with a severe drought in one year and cultivation in another both causing large short-term (~3 months) net losses of CO<inf>2</inf>-C (100-200gCm-2). However, CO<inf>2</inf> was regained later in both of these years so that on annual timescales, the site was a CO<inf>2</inf> sink or CO<inf>2</inf> neutral. Management practices such as effluent application and harvesting silage also influenced non-CO<inf>2</inf>-C fluxes, and had a large impact on annual NECB. Despite these major environmental or management perturbations, both NEP and NECB were relatively constant on annual timescales. It is likely that this apparent resilience of the CO<inf>2</inf> and C balance to perturbations was at least partly attributable to the relatively warm temperatures, also in winter, providing good growing conditions year-round (in the absence of major perturbations such as moisture stress). In several instances, the farmer's decisions aimed at maintaining a constant milk yield between years also appeared to contribute to a relatively stable C balance. Averaged over the full four-year study period, the site was a net sink for both CO<inf>2</inf> (NEP=165±51gCm-2y-1), and total C (NECB=61±53gCm-2y-1) after non-CO<inf>2</inf>-C fluxes were accounted for. Annual NEP and NECB values were similar to results collated from other managed temperate grasslands on mineral soils globally, for which average NEP and NECB were 188±44gCm-2y-1 and 44±33gCm-2y-1, respectively. In the global dataset, we noted a general trend for increased C sequestration with increasing NEP, suggesting that it may be possible to meet the dual goal of increased pasture production (thus milk, meat and fiber production) and increasing soil C storage in managed temperate grasslands.

The most rapidly growing and contentious of these systems is organic agriculture. Whether organic agriculture can continue to expand will likely be determined by whether it is economically competitive with conventional agriculture. Here, we examined the financial performance of organic and conventional agriculture by conducting a meta-analysis of a global dataset spanning 55 crops grown on five continents. When organic premiums were not applied, benefit/cost ratios (-8 to -7%) and net present values (-27 to -23%) of organic agriculture were significantly lower than conventional agriculture. However, when actual premiums were applied, organic agriculture was significantly more profitable (22-35%) and had higher benefit/cost ratios (20-24%) than conventional agriculture. Although premiums were 29-32%, breakeven premiums necessary for organic profits to match conventional profits were only 5-7%, even with organic yields being 10-18% lower. Total costs were not significantly different, but labor costs were significantly higher (7-13%) with organic farming practices. Studies in our meta-analysis accounted for neither environmental costs (negative externalities) nor ecosystem services from good farming practices, which likely favor organic agriculture. With only 1% of the global agricultural land in organic production, our findings suggest that organic agriculture can continue to expand even if premiums decline. Furthermore, with their multiple sustainability benefits, organic farming systems can contribute a larger share in feeding the world. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract describes a meta-analysis based on a global dataset covering 55 crops on five continents, which is directly related to agriculture and meets all inclusion criteria.",

Some types of negative shocks, for example weather-related agricultural losses and vector-borne diseases, are expected to occur more frequently as a result of climate change. In this paper we measure the role of household- and location-specific characteristics in conditioning behavioural responses to a wide range of idiosyncratic and covariate shocks. We use data from 8,000 rural households in 25 developing countries, compiled in the global database of the Poverty Environment Network. We employ a hierarchical multinomial logit model to identify the importance of characteristics observed at different levels of aggregation on a set of strategies aimed at coping with economic shocks. Results indicate that in response to idiosyncratic shocks, households tend to deplete financial and durable assets, whereas covariate and thus often climate-related shocks predominantly result in reduced consumption. Households in sites characterised by high asset wealth tend to cope with shocks in a more proactive way than those in sites with average or below average asset wealth, but the role of asset types in conditioning shock responses varies across regions.

Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research (CGIAR; in short CG) centres play an important role in conserving and distributing PGR through their genebanks. CG genebanks assembled the germplasm through collecting missions and acquisition the same from national genebanks of other countries. Using the Genesys Global Portal on Plant Genetic Resources, the World Information and Early Warning System (WIEWS) on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and other relevant databases, we analysed the conservation status of Indian-origin PGR accessions (both cultivated and wild forms possessed by India) in CG genebanks and other national genebanks, including the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) genebanks, which can be considered as an indicator of Indian contribution to the global germplasm collection. A total of 28,027,770 accessions are being conserved world-wide by 446 organizations represented in Genesys; of these, 3.78% (100,607) are Indian-origin accessions. Similarly, 62,920 Indian-origin accessions (8.73%) have been conserved in CG genebanks which are accessible to the global research community for utilization in their respective crop improvement programmes. A total of 60 genebanks including 11 CG genebanks have deposited 824,625 accessions of PGR in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV) as safety duplicates; the average number of accessions deposited by each genebank is 13,744, and amongst them there are 66,339 Indian-origin accessions.

The new global historical irrigation data set (HID) provides estimates of the temporal development of the area equipped for irrigation (AEI) between 1900 and 2005 at 5 arcmin resolution. We collected sub-national irrigation statistics from various sources and found that the global extent of AEI increased from 63 million ha (Mha) in 1900 to 111 Mha in 1950 and 306 Mha in 2005. We developed eight gridded versions of time series of AEI by combining sub-national irrigation statistics with different data sets on the historical extent of cropland and pasture. Different rules were applied to maximize consistency of the gridded products to sub-national irrigation statistics or to historical cropland and pasture data sets.

Among the various methods to estimate root turnover, the root's radiocarbon signature has rarely been applied to grassland soils previously, although the value of this approach is known from studies in forest soils. In this paper, we utilize the root's radiocarbon signatures, at 25 plots, in mountain grasslands of the montane to alpine zone of Europe.We place the results in context of a global data base on root turnover and discuss driving factors. Root turnover rates were similar to those of a subsample of the global data, comprising a similar temperature range, but measured with different approaches, indicating that the radiocarbon method gives reliable, plausible and comparable results. Root turnover rates (0.06-1.0 y-1) scaled significantly and exponentially with mean annual temperatures. Root turnover rates indicated no trend with soil depth. The temperature sensitivity was significantly higher in mountain grassland, compared to the global data set, suggesting additional factors influencing root turnover. Information on management intensity from the 25 plots reveals that root turnover may be accelerated under intensive and moderate management compared to low intensity or semi-natural conditions. Because management intensity, in the studied ecosystems, co-varied with temperature, estimates on root turnover, based on mean annual temperature alone, may be biased. A greater recognition of management as a driver for root dynamics is warranted when effects of climatic change on belowground carbon dynamics are studied in mountain grasslands. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The abstract mentions using a global database on root turnover to put its findings on grassland ecosystems in context.,

Carbon fluxes from land to rivers have probably increased by 0.1 to 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year as a result of disturbances such as deforestation, agricultural intensification and the injection of human wastewater. Most dissolved organic carbon in rivers originates from young organic carbon from soils and vegetation, but aged carbon removed from the modern carbon cycle is also exported in many systems. Here we analyse a global data set of radiocarbon ages of riverine dissolved organic carbon and spatial data on land cover, population and environmental variables. We find that the age of dissolved organic carbon in rivers increases with population density and the proportion of human-dominated landscapes within a watershed, and decreases with annual precipitation. We reason that disturbance reintroduces aged soil organic matter into the modern carbon cycle, although fossil carbon in fertilizer or petroleum products may also be a source of aged carbon in disturbed watersheds. The total export from the terrestrial environment to freshwater systems remains unknown; nevertheless, our results suggest that 3-9% of dissolved organic carbon in rivers is aged carbon mobilized by human disturbance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper analyzes a global dataset of radiocarbon ages and spatial data on land cover, including agricultural intensification, meeting all criteria.",

As targeting individuals alone does not seem to be an effective strategy to reduce maternal mortality (Millennium Development Goal 5), the present study sought to reveal the role of many distant macrostructural factors affecting maternal mortality at the global level. Methods: After preparing a global dataset, 439 indicators were selected from nearly 1800 indicators based on their relevance and the application of proper inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to assess the relationship between these indicators and maternal mortality. Only indicators with statistically significant correlation more than 0.2, and missing values less than 20% were maintained. Due to the high multicollinearity among the remaining indicators, after missing values analysis and imputation, factor analysis was performed with principal component analysis as the method of extraction. Ten factors were finally extracted and entered into a multiple regression analysis. Results: The findings of this study not only consolidated the results of earlier studies about maternal mortality, but also added new evidence. Education (std. B=-0.442), private sector and trade (std. B=-0.316), and governance (std. B=-0.280) were found to be the most important macrostructural factors associated with maternal mortality. Employment and labor structure, economic policy and debt, agriculture and food production, private sector infrastructure investment, and health finance were also some other critical factors. These distal factors explained about 65% of the variability in maternal mortality between different countries. Conclusion: Decreasing maternal mortality requires dealing with various factors other than individual determinants including political will, reallocation of national resources (especially health resources) in the governmental sector, education, attention to the expansion of the private sector trade and improving spectrums of governance. In other words, sustainable reduction in maternal mortality (as a development indicator) will depend on long-term planning for multi-faceted development. Moreover, trade, debt, political stability, and strength of legal rights can be affected by elements outside the borders of countries and global determinants.

It plays a vital role in satisfying basic needs for drinking water, agriculture and industrial activities. During times of drought groundwater sustains baseflow to rivers and wetlands, thereby supporting ecosystems. Most global-scale hydrological models (GHMs) do not include a groundwater flow component, mainly due to lack of geohydrological data at the global scale. For the simulation of lateral flow and groundwater head dynamics, a realistic physical representation of the groundwater system is needed, especially for GHMs that run at finer resolutions. In this study we present a global-scale groundwater model (run at 6' resolution) using MODFLOW to construct an equilibrium water table at its natural state as the result of long-term climatic forcing. The used aquifer schematization and properties are based on available global data sets of lithology and transmissivities combined with the estimated thickness of an upper, unconfined aquifer. This model is forced with outputs from the land-surface PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) model, specifically net recharge and surface water levels. A sensitivity analysis, in which the model was run with various parameter settings, showed that variation in saturated conductivity has the largest impact on the groundwater levels simulated. Validation with observed groundwater heads showed that groundwater heads are reasonably well simulated for many regions of the world, especially for sediment basins (R2= 0.95). The simulated regional-scale groundwater patterns and flow paths demonstrate the relevance of lateral groundwater flow in GHMs. Inter-basin groundwater flows can be a significant part of a basin's water budget and help to sustain river baseflows, especially during droughts.

Location: This study was conducted at a global scale. Methods: Each global cropping systems model was assessed by latitude as a measure of biophysical plausibility and each pair of models was compared using a Gaussian filter to remove trivial spatial discrepancies. Model disagreement was explored in relation to the interdependent input data of each model pair with a particular focus on cropland extent. The influence of the observed model differences on subsequent analyses was demonstrated using model-dependent estimates of the yield gap as an example. Results: The results of our analysis indicate that the choice of cropping systems model is non-trivial: considerable differences exist between model-specific estimates of the yield gap across nearly all climate zones and the average model difference exceeds the average estimated yield gap in certain regions. The differences in crop-specific harvested area and yield products of each model are significant, and mostly result from differences in the input datasets and downscaling methodologies. In particular, the choice of dataset on cropland extent proved to be influential regardless of the downscaling process employed. Main conclusions: Discrepancies in the final products of cropping systems models are currently poorly understood, but have implications for basic policy decisions relating to agricultural production and food security. The considerable disagreement between models serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges to the creation of spatially explicit estimates of harvested area and yield based on crop statistics. Our analysis helps shed light on the importance of model choice by demonstrating the implications for further analyses that depend on cropping systems models, and works to overcome these challenges by characterizing model-dependent differences in harvested area and yield. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,The paper's focus is the analysis and comparison of four major global cropping systems models and datasets.,

In this context, hyperspectral imaging offers a particularly promising approach since it provides non-destructive measurements of plants correlated with internal structure and biochemical compounds. In this paper, we present a cascade of data mining techniques for fast and reliable data-driven sketching of complex hyperspectral dynamics in plant science and plant phenotyping. To achieve this, we build on top of a recent linear time matrix factorization technique, called Simplex Volume Maximization, in order to automatically discover archetypal hyperspectral signatures that are characteristic for particular diseases. The methods were applied on a data set of barley leaves (Hordeum vulgare) diseased with foliar plant pathogens Pyrenophora teres, Puccinia hordei and Blumeria graminis hordei . Towards more intuitive visualizations of plant disease dynamics, we use the archetypal signatures to create structured summaries that are inspired by metro maps, i.e. schematic diagrams of public transport networks. Metro maps of plant disease dynamics produced on several real-world data sets conform to plant physiological knowledge and explicitly illustrate the interaction between diseases and plants. Most importantly, they provide an abstract and interpretable view on plant disease progression. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The abstract mentions a dataset of barley leaves, but there is no indication of global coverage, thus failing to meet the inclusion criteria.",

We quantified the degree of land modification and the amount and spatial configuration of low modified lands (i.e., natural areas relatively free from human alteration) across all ecoregions and biomes. We identified that fewer unmodified lands remain than previously reported and that most of the world is in a state of intermediate modification, with 52% of ecoregions classified as moderately modified.

We undertook a meta-analysis of published data from more than 4000 sites worldwide. The results show that there is extraordinarily high variability in erosion rates, with almost any rate apparently possible irrespective of slope, climate, scale, land use/land cover and other environmental characteristics. However, detailed analysis revealed a number of general features including positive relationships of erosion rate with slope and annual precipitation, and a significant effect of land use, with agricultural lands yielding the highest erosion rates, and forest and shrublands yielding the lowest. Despite these general trends, there is much variability that is not explained by this combination of factors, but is related, at least partially, to the experimental conditions. Our analysis revealed a negative relationship between erosion rate and the size of the study area involved; significant differences associated with differing measurement methods, with direct sediment measurement yielding the lowest erosion rates, and bathymetric, radioisotope and modeling methods yielding the highest rates; and a very important effect of the duration of the experiment. Our results highlight that, when interpreting erosion rates, the experimental conditions involved must be taken into account. Even so, the data suggest that only order of magnitude approximations of erosion rates are possible, and these retain a very large degree of uncertainty. Consequently, for practical purposes such as calculation of global sediment budgets, empirical equations are not a substitute for direct measurements. Our results also show that a large proportion of the experiments have been short-term (less than 3 years), which reduces dramatically the reliability of the estimated erosion rates, given the highly non-normal behavior of soil erosion (time-dependency). Despite the efforts already made, more long-term measurement experiments need to be performed, especially in regions of the world that are under-represented in global datasets. In addition, protocols need to be established for standardizing the measurement methods and reporting the results, to enable data to be compared among diverse sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier BAT.

According to a review of the literature, food scientists have studied the many health benefits of these compounds against pernicious human diseases (HDs). Today, choosing a healthy diet has become an essential part of healthy living and fitness. Many studies have shown that people who follow a specific diet (especially polyphenol-rich diets) are at a low risk for a range of chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, etc. The present research is a comprehensive review of studies on PCs with a focus on HDs that seeks to find out why some PCs have received such considerable attention all over the world. Data were collected from the Scopus database and a hierarchical cluster analysis was used with Ward's method to analyze the data. The results showed that three countries most involved in research on PCs are USA, China, and India, and also found that quercetin, catechin, and kaempferol are the three most studied PCs.

In these contexts, soil erosion by water is a serious problem, especially in semi-arid and semi-humid areas of the world. Although the beneficial effects of mulching are known, further research is needed to quantify them, especially in areas where soil erosion by water represents a severe threat. In the literature, there are still some uncertainties about how to maximize the effectiveness of mulching to reduce the soil and water loss rates. Given the seriousness of soil erosion by water and the uncertainties that are still associated with the correct use of mulching, this study review aims to (i) develop a documented and global database on the use of mulching with vegetative residues; (ii) quantify the effects of mulching on soil and water losses based on different measurement methods and, consequently, different spatial scales; (iii) evaluate the effects of different types of mulches on soil and water losses based on different measurement methods; and (iv) provide suggestions for more sustainable soil management. The data published in the literature have been collected. The results showed the beneficial effects of mulching in combating soil erosion by water in all of the environments considered here, with reduction rates in the average sediment concentration, soil loss and runoff volume that, in some cases, exceeded 90%. However, the economic feasibility of mulching application was not readily available in the literature. Therefore, more research should be performed to help both farmers and land managers by providing them with evidence-based means for implementing more sustainable soil management practices.

Here we provide a plausible breakdown of global agricultural and nutrient production by farm size, and also study the associations between farm size, agricultural diversity, and nutrient production. This analysis is crucial to design interventions that might be appropriately targeted to promote healthy diets and ecosystems in the face of population growth, urbanisation, and climate change.Methods We used existing spatially-explicit global datasets to estimate the production levels of 41 major crops, seven livestock, and 14 aquaculture and fish products. From overall production estimates, we estimated the production of vitamin A, vitamin B-12, folate, iron, zinc, calcium, calories, and protein. We also estimated the relative contribution of farms of different sizes to the production of different agricultural commodities and associated nutrients, as well as how the diversity of food production based on the number of different products grown per geographic pixel and distribution of products within this pixel (Shannon diversity index [H]) changes with different farm sizes.Findings Globally, small and medium farms (<= 50 ha) produce 51-77% of nearly all commodities and nutrients examined here. However, important regional differences exist. Large farms (>50 ha) dominate production in North America, South America, and Australia and New Zealand. In these regions, large farms contribute between 75% and 100% of all cereal, livestock, and fruit production, and the pattern is similar for other commodity groups. By contrast, small farms (<= 20 ha) produce more than 75% of most food commodities in Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and China. In Europe, West Asia and North Africa, and Central America, medium-size farms (20-50 ha) also contribute substantially to the production of most food commodities. Very small farms (<= 2 ha) are important and have local significance in Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and South Asia, where they contribute to about 30% of most food commodities. The majority of vegetables (81%), roots and tubers (72%), pulses (67%), fruits (66%), fish and livestock products (60%), and cereals (56%) are produced in diverse landscapes (H>1.5). Similarly, the majority of global micronutrients (53-81%) and protein (57%) are also produced in more diverse agricultural landscapes (H>1.5). By contrast, the majority of sugar (73%) and oil crops (57%) are produced in less diverse ones (H <= 1.5), which also account for the majority of global calorie production (56%). The diversity of agricultural and nutrient production diminishes as farm size increases. However, areas of the world with higher agricultural diversity produce more nutrients, irrespective of farm size.Interpretation Our results show that farm size and diversity of agricultural production vary substantially across regions and are key structural determinants of food and nutrient production that need to be considered in plans to meet social, economic, and environmental targets. At the global level, both small and large farms have key roles in food and nutrition security. Efforts to maintain production diversity as farm sizes increase seem to be necessary to maintain the production of diverse nutrients and viable, multifunctional, sustainable landscapes.

Despite its simplicity and limitations, the model has proved useful for topographic evolution, knickpoint migration, palaeotopography reconstruction, and the determination of rock uplift patterns and rates. However, the unknown parameters K,, m, and n are often fixed arbitrarily or are based on assumptions about the physics of the erosion processes that are not always valid, which considerably limits the use and interpretation of the model. In this study, we compile a unique global data set of published basin-averaged erosion rates that use detrital cosmogenic Be-10. These data (N = 1457) enable values for fundamental river properties to be empirically constrained, often for the first time, such as the concavity of the river profile (m/n ratio or concavity index), the link between channel slope and erosion rate (slope exponent n), and substrate erodibility (K). These three parameters are calculated for 59 geographic areas using the integral method of channel profile analysis and allow for a global scale analysis in terms of climatic, tectonic, and environmental settings. In order to compare multiple sites, we also normalize n and K using a reference concavity index min=0.5. A multiple regression analysis demonstrates that intuitive or previously demonstrated local-scale trends, such as the correlation between K and precipitation rates, do not appear at a global scale. Our results suggest that the slope exponent is generally >1, meaning that the relationship between erosion rate and the channel gradient is nonlinear and thus support the hypothesis that incision is a threshold controlled process.

However, the proportion of households using groundwater compared with other sources is rarely quantified, with national and global datasets more focused on facilities-rather than resources-used. This is a significant gap in knowledge, particularly in light of efforts to expand water services in line with the inclusive and integrated agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals. Understanding the prevalence of groundwater reliance for drinking is critical for those involved in water services planning and management, so they can better monitor and advocate for management of water resources that supports sustainable services for households. This paper contributes data that can be used to strengthen the integration of resource considerations within water service delivery and inform the work of development partners supporting this area. We approach this issue from two perspectives. Firstly, we collate data on the proportion of households using groundwater as their primary drinking water source for 10 Southeast Asian and Pacific nations, finding an average of 62% (range of 17-93% for individual countries) of households in urban areas and 60% (range of 22-95%) of households in rural areas rely on groundwater for drinking. Together, these constitute 79% of the total population across the case study countries.

Here we present a global analysis detecting yield variability change and attributing it to recent climate change using spatially-explicit global data sets of historical yields and an agro-climatic index based on daily weather data. The agro-climatic index used here is the sum of effective global radiation intercepted by the crop canopy during the yield formation stage that includes thresholds for extreme temperatures and extreme soil moisture deficit. Results show that year-to-year variations in yields of maize, soybean, rice and wheat in 1981-2010 significantly decreased in 19%-33% of the global harvested area with varying extent of area by crop. However, in 9%-22% of harvested area, significant increase in yield variability was detected. Major crop-producing regions with increased yield variability include maize and soybean in Argentina and Northeast China, rice in Indonesia and Southern China, and wheat in Australia, France and Ukraine. Examples of relatively food-insecure regions with increased yield variability are maize in Kenya and Tanzania and rice in Bangladesh and Myanmar. On a global scale, over 21% of the yield variability change could be explained by the change in variability of the agro-climatic index. More specifically, the change in variability of temperatures exceeding the optimal range for yield formation was more important in explaining the yield variability change than other abiotic stresses, such as temperature below the optimal range for yield formation and soil water deficit. Our findings show that while a decrease in yield variability is the main trend worldwide across crops, yields in some regions of the world have become more unstable, suggesting the need for long-term global yield monitoring and a better understanding of the contributions of technology, management, policy and climate to ongoing yield variability change.",yes,"The paper uses global datasets on historical crop yields and climate to perform a global analysis, directly meeting all inclusion criteria without violating any exclusion criteria.",

Carbon fluxes from land to rivers have probably increased by 0.1 to 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year as a result of disturbances such as deforestation, agricultural intensification and the injection of human wastewater(2). Most dissolved organic carbon in rivers originates from young organic carbon from soils and vegetation(3), but aged carbon removed from the modern carbon cycle is also exported in many systems. Here we analyse a global data set of radiocarbon ages of riverine dissolved organic carbon and spatial data on land cover, population and environmental variables. We find that the age of dissolved organic carbon in rivers increases with population density and the proportion of human-dominated landscapes within a watershed, and decreases with annual precipitation. We reason that disturbance reintroduces aged soil organic matter into the modern carbon cycle, although fossil carbon in fertilizer or petroleum products may also be a source of aged carbon in disturbed watersheds. The total export from the terrestrial environment to freshwater systems remains unknown; nevertheless, our results suggest that 3-9% of dissolved organic carbon in rivers is aged carbon mobilized by human disturbance.",yes,"The paper uses a global dataset on carbon in rivers, linking it to land cover and disturbances like agriculture.

Here, we combined a global dataset of field warming experiments (48 sites) for wheat, maize, rice and soybean with gridded global crop models to produce field-data-constrained estimates on responses of crop yield to changes in temperature (S-T) with the emergent-constraint approach. Our constrained estimates show with >95% probability that warmer temperatures would reduce yields for maize (-7.1 +/- 2.8% K-1), rice (-5.6 +/- 2.0% K-1) and soybean (-10.6 +/- 5.8% K-1). For wheat,S(T)was 89% likely to be negative (-2.9 +/- 2.3% K-1). Uncertainties associated with modelledS(T)were reduced by 12-54% for the four crops but data constraints do not allow for further disentanglingS(T)of different crop types. A key implication for impact assessments after the Paris Agreement is that direct warming impacts alone will reduce major crop yields by 3-13% under 2 K global warming without considering CO(2)fertilization effects and adaptations. Even if warming was limited to 1.5 K, all major producing countries would still face notable warming-induced yield reduction. This yield loss could be partially offset by projected benefits from elevated CO2, whose magnitude remains uncertain, and highlights the challenge to compensate it by autonomous adaptation.Global responses of crops to warmer temperatures will affect agricultural sustainability.

Using a comprehensive global database and parsimonious modelling, we evaluate the impact of anthropogenic soil erosion on C fluxes between the Earth's surface and atmosphere from the onset of agriculture to the present day. We find that agricultural erosion represents a very large and transient perturbation to the C cycle and has induced a cumulative net uptake of 78 +/- 22 Pg C in terrestrial ecosystems during the period 6000 BC to AD 2015. This erosion-induced soil organic C sink is estimated to have offset 37 +/- 10% of previously recognized C emissions resulting from ALCC. We estimate that rates of C burial have increased by a factor of 4.6 since AD 1850. Thus, current assessments may significantly overestimate both past and future anthropogenic emissions from the land. Given that ALCC is the most uncertain component of the global C budget and that there is a strong connection between ALCC and erosion, an explicit representation of erosion and burial processes is essential to fully understand the impact of human activities on the net soil-atmosphere C exchange.",yes,"The paper uses a comprehensive global database to study soil erosion and carbon fluxes, which is related to agriculture and land use.

Here, we review the current state of knowledge of ten common land management activities for their biogeochemical and biophysical impacts, the level of process understanding and data availability. Our review shows that ca. one-tenth of the ice-free land surface is under intense human management, half under medium and one-fifth under extensive management.

Although we identify multiple impediments to progress, we conclude that the current status of process understanding and data availability is sufficient to advance with incorporating management in, for example, Earth system or dynamic vegetation models in order to provide a systematic assessment of their role in the Earth system.

However, due to the interference of external factors and the irregularity of its own changes, it is still a difficult problem, especially in long-term prediction. Also, most of the current researches only report good results in short-term prediction of dissolved oxygen. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of attention-based recurrent neural networks (RNN) on short-term prediction (including about 1 h, 2 h) and long-term prediction (including about 8 h, 24 h and 48 h) of dissolved oxygen. We systematically discuss and compare the application of the attention-based RNN method in dissolved oxygen prediction, including spatial attention (Input-Attn), temporal attention (Temporal-Attn), spatio-temporal independent attention (DARNN and GeoMAN), and spatio-temporal joint attention (Spatio-temporal-Attn). Specifically, we first analyze the popular methods for water quality prediction and attention-based RNN methods for time series prediction. Then, we develop the latest attention based RNN into a multi-step prediction for long-term dissolved oxygen prediction. Next, we propose two attention-based RNN structures to capture temporal relationships separately and learn spatio-temporal relationships simultaneously, which have achieved comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods.

J.; Bundy, Jacob G.; Jourdan, Fabien; Ebbels, Timothy",2021,"Over-representation analysis (ORA) is one of the commonest pathway analysis approaches used for the functional interpretation of metabolomics datasets. Despite the widespread use of ORA in metabolomics, the community lacks guidelines detailing its best-practice use. Many factors have a pronounced impact on the results, but to date their effects have received little systematic attention. Using five publicly available datasets, we demonstrated that changes in parameters such as the background set, differential metabolite selection methods, and pathway database used can result in profoundly different ORA results. The use of a non-assay-specific background set, for example, resulted in large numbers of false-positive pathways. Pathway database choice, evaluated using three of the most popular metabolic pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome, and BioCyc), led to vastly different results in both the number and function of significantly enriched pathways. Factors that are specific to metabolomics data, such as the reliability of compound identification and the chemical bias of different analytical platforms also impacted ORA results. Simulated metabolite misidentification rates as low as 4% resulted in both gain of false-positive pathways and loss of truly significant pathways across all datasets. Our results have several practical implications for ORA users, as well as those using alternative pathway analysis methods. We offer a set of recommendations for the use of ORA in metabolomics, alongside a set of minimal reporting guidelines, as a first step towards the standardisation of pathway analysis in metabolomics.Author summary Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field of study involving the profiling of small molecules within an organism. It allows researchers to understand the effects of biological status (such as health or disease) on cellular biochemistry, and has wide-ranging applications, from biomarker discovery and personalised medicine in healthcare to crop protection and food security in agriculture. Pathway analysis helps to understand which biological pathways, representing collections of molecules performing a particular function, may be involved in response to a disease phenotype, or drug treatment, for example. Over-representation analysis (ORA) is perhaps the most common pathway analysis method used in the metabolomics community. However, ORA can give drastically different results depending on the input data and parameters used. Here, we have established the effects of these factors on ORA results using computational modifications applied to five real-world datasets. Based on our results, we offer the research community a set of best-practice recommendations applicable not only to ORA but also to other pathway analysis methods to help ensure the reliability and reproducibility of results.",maybe,"The paper uses publicly available metabolomics datasets and mentions agriculture as an application.

We assume the capability of a MoD system to be enhanced by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the streets to be hailed by users. A key challenge of the MoD system is that of real-time, fine-grained mobility demand and traffic flow sensing and prediction. This paper presents novel Gaussian process (GP) decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithms for real-time, fine-grained traffic modeling and prediction with a fleet of MoD vehicles. The predictive performance of our decentralized data fusion algorithms are theoretically guaranteed to be equivalent to that of sophisticated centralized sparse GP approximations. We derive consensus filtering variants requiring only local communication between neighboring vehicles. We theoretically guarantee the performance of our decentralized active sensing algorithms. When they are used to gather informative data for mobility demand prediction, they can achieve a dual effect of fleet rebalancing to service mobility demands. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our algorithms are significantly more time-efficient and scalable in the size of data and fleet while achieving predictive performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art algorithms.Note to Practitioners-Knowing, understanding, and predicting spatiotemporally varying traffic phenomena in real time has become increasingly important to the goal of achieving smooth-flowing, congestion-free traffic in densely populated urban cities, which motivates our work here. This paper addresses the following fundamental problem of data fusion and active sensing: How can a fleet of autonomous robotic vehicles or mobile probes actively cruise a road network to gather and assimilate the most informative data for predicting a spatiotemporally varying traffic phenomenon like a mobility demand pattern or traffic flow? Existing centralized solutions are poorly suited because they suffer from a single point of failure and incur huge communication, space, and time overheads with large data and fleet. This paper proposes novel efficient and scalable decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees. The practical applicability of our algorithms is not restricted to traffic monitoring [1]-[4]; they can be used in other environmental sensing applications such as mineral prospecting [5], precision agriculture, monitoring of ocean/freshwater phenomena (e.g., plankton bloom) [6]-[9], forest ecosystems, pollution (e.g., oil spill), or contamination. Note that the decentralized data fusion component of our algorithms can also be used for static sensors and passive mobile probes and, interestingly, adapted to parallel implementations to be run on a cluster of machines for achieving efficient and scalable probabilistic prediction (i.e., with predictive uncertainty) with large data. Empirical results show that our algorithms can perform well with two datasets featuring real-world traffic phenomena in the densely-populated urban city of Singapore. A limitation of our algorithms is that the decentralized data fusion components assume independence between multiple traffic phenomena while the decentralized active sensing components only work for a single traffic phenomenon. So, in our future work, we will generalize our algorithms to perform active sensing of multiple traffic phenomena and remove the assumption of independence between them.",no,"Although precision agriculture is mentioned as a potential application, the actual datasets used in the study are from Singapore, which is local coverage and thus violates an exclusion criterion.",

At the sampling locations of experimental animals, we determined environmental pCO(2) conditions by integrating data from global databases and pCO(2) measurements from buoys. Experimental pCO(2) scenarios were compared with upper pCO(2) using an index considering the upper environmental pCO(2). For most taxa, a statistically significant negative linear relationship was observed between this index and mean biological responses, indicating that the impact of a given experimental pCO(2) scenario depends on the deviation from the upper pCO(2) level experienced by local populations. Our results highlight the importance of local biological adaptation and the need to consider present pCO(2) natural variability while interpreting experimental results.",no,"The study focuses on marine invertebrates and ocean acidification, which is not directly related to agriculture.",

G.; Havlik, Petr; Herrero, Mario; Valin, Hugo; Faaij, Andre P. C.; Wicke, Birka",2017,"Cattle production is characterized by high land requirements, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the resulting land use change (LUC) and cradle to farm gate processes. Intensification of cattle production systems is considered an important strategy for mitigating anthropogenic GHG emissions. When categorizing production practices into three systems, i.e. pasture-based, mixed and industrial systems, intensification can either take place within one system or through the transition to another more productive system. This study investigates the impacts of these two pathways on farm gate emissions and LUC-related emissions (expressed in kg CO2-eq per kg of milk or beef) in nine world regions. First, a review is conducted of bottom-up studies on farm gate emissions (without LUC) from dairy production in Europe and beef production in North America and Brazil. Then, a global data set on GHG emissions from cattle production is used to discuss the GHG emission impacts of the two development pathways in other regions. Finally, the GLOBIOM model is applied to perform a global assessment of land occupation and LUC-related emissions. For dairy in Europe, farm gate emission reductions of 1%-14% are found for intensification within one system and 2%-26% for system transitions. In Europe as well as other developed regions, the comparative influence of both pathways on the GHG balance largely depends on the specific design of the initial and final production systems. In developing countries especially, there is a greater potential for emission reductions through intensification within the pasture-based system. The additional reduction potential of moving from pasture-based to mixed and industrial production is limited. Also, emission reductions of intensification within the mixed system are smaller compared to the pasture-based system. For beef production in Brazil, intensification within pasture-based systems can attain significant farm gate emission reductions (>50%). The same is true for pasture-based systems in other developing regions and also some developed regions. Furthermore, the additional GHG reduction potentials of moving from pasture-based to mixed systems, and of intensification within mixed systems are larger for beef than for dairy. Although both the dairy and beef sector can often attain significant farm gate emission reductions through intensification within pasture-based systems, the transition to mixed systems is important to reduce land occupation and LUC-related emissions. LUC mitigation is considered to be the most important GHG mitigation strategy for cattle production in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Important, but technically and economically constrained strategies to reduce both farm gate and LUC-related emissions include increasing the productivity of grassland and cropland, and increasing the animal productivity through improved feed quality.

Using a combination of in situ station measurements (Global Historical Climatology Network's Daily data set) and multiple other gridded data products, a derived 1 degrees data set of growing season climate indices and extremes is compiled over the major growing regions for maize, wheat, soybean, and rice for 1951-2006. This data set contains growing season climate indices that are agriculturally relevant, such as the number of hot days, duration of dry spells, and rainfall intensity. Before 1980, temperature-related indices had few trends; after 1980, statistically significant warming trends exist for each crop in the majority of growing regions. In particular, crops have increasingly been exposed to extreme hot temperatures, above which yields have been shown to decline. Rainfall trends are less consistent compared to temperature, with some regions receiving more rainfall and others less. Anomalous temperature and precipitation conditions are shown to often occur concurrently, with dry growing seasons more likely to be hotter, have larger drought indices, and have larger vapor pressure deficits. This leads to the confluence of a variety of climate conditions that negatively impact crop yields. These results show a consistent increase in global agricultural exposure to negative climate conditions since 1980.",yes,The paper compiles a new global dataset of agriculturally relevant climate extremes using existing data sources like the Global Historical Climatology Network's Daily data set.,Global Historical Climatology Network's Daily data set

However, longtime series datasets for these are generally unavailable. The spatiotemporal dynamics of annual paddy rice and cropping intensity over the last 20 years have rarely been investigated at the continental scale. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to generate a publicly available database on annual PRA and CI and investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of annual PRA and CI across the Asian monsoon region (AMR) over the last 20 years. METHODS: The annual PRA and cropping CI maps at 500-m resolution across the AMR from 2000 to 2020 were generated by the improved methods based on remote sensing data from multiple sources. Also, the spatiotemporal trends of paddy rice fields and cropping intensity were further analyzed based on Sen's slope and the Mann-Kendall test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the resultant annual PRA and CI were correlated with that based on field samples and census data. They were also consistent with the spatial distribution of existing high-resolution products in a specific year and region. The paddy rice planting area increased significantly (p < 0.05) in northeastern China and northwestern India and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in southern China during 2000-2020. Single- and double-cropping were dominant in the AMR. Both double-cropping and triple- cropping increased significantly (p < 0.05) during 2001-2020. Single-cropping was converted to double- cropping in approximately 198.1 x 105 ha of areas, mainly in the North China Plain and northern India. And double-cropping was converted to triple-cropping in approximately 9.5 x 105 ha of areas, mainly in the Mekong Delta in Southeast Asia.

Optical remote sensing has revolutionized our ability to map CI over large areas in a repeated and cost-efficient manner. Previous studies have mainly focused on investigating the spatiotemporal patterns of CI ranging from regions to the entire globe with the use of coarse-resolution data, which are inadequate for characterizing farming practices within heterogeneous landscapes. To fill this knowledge gap, in this study, we utilized multiple satellite data to develop a global, spatially continuous CI map dataset at 30m resolution (GCI30). Accuracy assessments indicated that GCI30 exhibited high agreement with visually interpreted validation samples and in situ observations from the PhenoCam network. We carried out both statistical and spatial comparisons of GCI30 with six existing global CI estimates. Based on GCI30, we estimated that the global average annual CI during 2016-2018 was 1.05, which is close to the mean (1.09) and median (1.07) CI values of the existing six global CI estimates, although the spatial resolution and temporal coverage vary significantly among products. A spatial comparison with two satellite-based land surface phenology products further suggested that GCI30 was not only capable of capturing the overall pattern of global CI but also provided many spatial details. GCI30 indicated that single cropping was the primary agricultural system on Earth, accounting for 81.57% (12.28 x 10(6) km(2)) of the world's cropland extent. Multiple-cropping systems, on the other hand, were commonly observed in South America and Asia.

Our approach exploits the geometrical relationships of the trajectories of weights along the time. Starting from a collection of data from a set of animals, we learn a family of parallel functions that fits the whole data set, instead of having one regression function for each individual. In this way, our method enables animals with only one or a few weights to have an accurate estimation of their future evolution. Thus, we learn a function F defined on the space of weights and time that separates the trajectories in such a way that F has constant values on each trajectory. The key point is that the specification of F can be done in terms of ordering constraints, in the same way as preference functions or ordinal regressors. Therefore, F can be obtained from a classification SVM (Support Vector Machines). To evaluate the method, we have used a collection of real world data sets of bovines of different breeds and ages.

C.; Schuurmans, Hanneke; Kleijer, Jonne; Miralles, Diego G.",2018,"The evaporation of water from land into the atmosphere is a key component of the hydrological cycle. Accurate estimates of this flux are essential for proper water management and irrigation scheduling. However, continuous and qualitative information on land evaporation is currently not available at the required spatio-temporal scales for agricultural applications and regional-scale water management. Here, we apply the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) at 100 m spatial resolution and daily time steps to provide estimates of land evaporation over The Netherlands, Flanders, and western Germany for the period 2013-2017. By making extensive use of microwave-based geophysical observations, we are able to provide data under all weather conditions. The soil moisture estimates from GLEAM at high resolution compare well with in situ measurements of surface soil moisture, resulting in a median temporal correlation coefficient of 0.76 across 29 sites. Estimates of terrestrial evaporation are also evaluated using in situ eddy-covariance measurements from five sites, and compared to estimates from the coarse-scale GLEAM v3.2b, land evaporation from the Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF), and reference grass evaporation based on Makkink's equation. All datasets compare similarly with in situ measurements and differences in the temporal statistics are small, with correlation coefficients against in situ data ranging from 0.65 to 0.95, depending on the site. Evaporation estimates from GLEAM-HR are typically bounded by the high values of the Makkink evaporation and the low values from LSA-SAF. While GLEAM-HR and LSA-SAF show the highest spatial detail, their geographical patterns diverge strongly due to differences in model assumptions, model parameterizations, and forcing data. The separate consideration of rainfall interception loss by tall vegetation in GLEAM-HR is a key cause of this divergence: while LSA-SAF reports maximum annual evaporation volumes in the Green Heart of The Netherlands, an area dominated by shrubs and grasses, GLEAM-HR shows its maximum in the national parks of the Veluwe and Heuvelrug, both densely-forested regions where rainfall interception loss is a dominant process.

Quantifying the spatial and temporal variations of these emissions is crucial for climate change mitigation. Although country-level information is reported regularly through national inventories and global databases, spatially explicit quantification of century-long dynamics of CH4 emissions from livestock has been poorly investigated. Using the Tier 2 method adopted from the 2019 Refinement to 2006 IPCC guidelines, we estimated CH4 emissions from global livestock at a spatial resolution of 0.083 degrees (similar to 9 km at the equator) during the period 1890-2019.

South Asia, tropical Africa, and Brazil have dominated the growth in global CH4 emissions from livestock in the recent three decades. Changes in livestock CH4 emissions were primarily associated with changes in population and national income and were also affected by the policy, diet shifts, livestock productivity improvement, and international trade. The new geospatial information on the magnitude and trends of livestock CH4 emissions identifies emission hotspots and spatial-temporal patterns, which will help to guide meaningful CH4 mitigation practices in the livestock sector at both local and global scales.",yes,"The abstract describes the creation of a new global inventory of methane emissions from livestock, which meets all inclusion criteria and does not violate any exclusion criteria.

Roman; Kastner, Thomas",2017,"Identifying the global hotspots of forestry driven species, ecosystem services losses and informing the consuming nations of their environmental footprint domestically and abroad is essential to design demand side interventions and induce sustainable production methods. Here we first use countryside species area relationship model to project species extinctions of four vertebrate taxa (mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles) due to forest land use in 174 countries. We combine the projected extinctions with a global database on the monetary value of ecosystem services provided by different biomes and with bilateral trade data of Wood products to calculate species extinctions and ecosystem services losses inflicted by national wood consumption and international wood trade. Results show that globally a total of 485 species are projected to go extinct due to current forest land use. About 32% of this projected loss can be attributed to land use devoted for export production. However, under the counterfactual scenario with the same consumption levels but no international trade of wood products, an additional 334 species are projected to go extinct. Globally, We find that losses of ecosystem services worth $1.5 trillion/year are embodied in the timber trade. Compared to high-income nations, tropical countries such as Philippines, Nicaragua, Sri Lanka, Gambia and Bolivia presented the highest net ecosystem services losses (>3000 US$/ha/year) that could not be compensated through current land rents, indicating underpriced exports. Small tropical countries also gained much lower rents per species extinction suffered. These results can help internalize these costs into the global trade through financial compensation mechanisms such as REDD + or through price premiums on wood sourced from these countries. Overall the results can provide valuable insights for devising national strategies to meet several of the global Aichi 2020 biodiversity targets and can also be useful for life cycle assessment and product labelling schemes.

However, existing STF models often fuse images from various satellites, not satisfying the demand for precise crop monitoring. In contrast, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images can deliver detailed data, and deep learning (DL)-based STF models have the potential to automatically extract abstract features. To this end, this study proposed a novel end-to-end DL-based STF model named UAV-Net, which can produce centimeter-scale UAV images. UAV-Net has an encoder-decoder architecture with Modified ResNet (MResNet), Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and decoder modules. The encoder uses MResNet modules to extract input features, while the FPN module performs a multiscale fusion of these features before reconstructing UAV images using transposed convolution in the decoder module. Through comparative and ablation experiments, this study evaluated the efficacies of MResNet modules with 18, 34, and 50 layers, along with the FPN module of UAV-Net. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrated that UAV-Net adequately produces UAV images both visually and quantitatively. Furthermore, a comparison with state-of-the-art STF models highlights the innovation and effectiveness of UAV-Net in producing centimeter-scale images.

These pathways, if not addressed, are likely to lead to impaired FNS and an increased burden of NCDs in PICTs. There is little doubt that Pacific nations will experience adverse impacts of climate change exacerbating existing health risks and other socio-cultural, political and economic drivers of food and nutrition insecurity and NCDs.

W.; Watt, Andrew D.",2024,"Background Snakebite envenoming represents a significant and often neglected public health challenge, particularly in rural communities across tropical and subtropical regions. An estimated 1.2-5.5 million people are envenomed by snakebites annually. More than 125,000 of these bites are fatal, and 3-4 times as many results in disability/disfigurement. Despite its prevalence, collecting accurate epidemiological data on snakebite is challenging. This systematic review and meta-analysis collates global epidemiology data on snakebite morbidity and mortality.Methods Medline, Embase, Cochrane and CINAHL Plus databases were searched for articles published between 2001-2022. Pooled incidence and mortality were obtained using random effects modelling, heterogeneity (I2) was tested, and sensitivity analyses performed. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale assessed study quality.Results Out of the four databases, 5,312 articles were found. After removing duplicates, 3,953 articles were screened by title and abstract and 65 articles containing information on snakebite epidemiology, encompassing 663,460 snakebites, were selected for analysis. The people most at risk for snakebite were men (59%), engaged in agricultural labour (27.5%), and residing in rural areas (66.7%). More than half (57%) of the reported bites resulted in envenoming. Incidents occurred frequently in the summer season (38.5%), during daytime (56.7%), and bites were most often to the lower limb (56.4%). Envenoming severity was frequently mild (46.7%), treated in hospital (68.3%), and was treated with anti-venom (64.7%). The pooled global incidence and mortality was 69.4 /100,000 population (95%CI: 36.8 to 101.9) and 0.33/100,000 population (95%CI, 0.14 to 0.52) per year, respectively. Stratified by continents, Asia had the highest incidence of 130.7/100,000 population (95%CI: 48.3 to 213.1) while Europe has the lowest with 0.7/100,000 population (95%CI: -0.2 to 1.5). The highest mortality was reported in Asia at 0.96/100,000 population (95% CI: 0.22 to 1.70), and Africa 0.44/100,000 population (95%CI: -0.03 to 0.84). Incidence was highest among inhabitants of lower-middle-income countries 132.7/100,000 population (95%CI: 55.4 to 209.9) while mortality was highest in low-income countries at 0.85/100,000 population (95% CI: -0.06 to 2.31).Results Out of the four databases, 5,312 articles were found.

It also reveals that while reported snakebite incidence was higher in lower-middle-income countries, the burden of mortality was greatest among inhabitants of low-income countries, again emphasising the need for greater efforts to tackle this neglected tropical disease.Snakebite envenoming poses a significant public health challenge, especially in rural tropical and subtropical areas. Annually, an estimated 1.2-5.5 million people are envenomed, with over 125,000 fatalities and many more suffering disabilities. Collecting accurate epidemiological data on snakebite is challenging. This systematic review and meta-analysis compile global data on snakebite morbidity and mortality.After screening thousands of articles, 65 were selected, covering 663,460 snakebites. Men in agricultural areas were most at risk, with rural dwellers bearing the brunt. Most bites occurred in summer, during the day, and affected the lower limb. Envenoming severity was typically mild, often treated in hospitals with anti-venom.Globally, the pooled incidence was 69.4/100,000 population per year and mortality was 0.33/100,000 population per year. Asia reported the highest incidence and mortality rates. Incidence was highest in lower-middle-income countries, while mortality was greatest in low-income countries.These findings underscore the urgent need to address the burden of snakebite envenoming, particularly in resource-limited settings.

We present a global database of country-level budget estimates for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) on cropland. The database, disseminated in FAOSTAT, is meant to provide a global reference, synthesizing and continuously updating the state of the art on this topic. The database covers 205 countries and territories, as well as regional and global aggregates, for the period from 1961 to 2020. Results highlight the wide range in nutrient use and nutrient use efficiencies across geographic regions, nutrients, and time. The average N balance on global cropland has remained fairly steady at about 50-55 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1) during the past 15 years, despite increasing N inputs. Regional trends, however, show recent average N surpluses that range from a low of about 10 kg N ha(- 1) yr (- 1) in Africa to more than 90 kg N ha( - 1) yr (- 1) in Asia. Encouragingly, average global cropland N use efficiency decreased from about 59 % in 1961 to a low of 43 % in 1988, but it has risen since then to a level of 55 %. Phosphorus deficits are mainly found in Africa, whereas potassium deficits occur in Africa and the Americas. This study introduces improvements over previous work in relation to the key nutrient coefficients affecting nutrient budgets and nutrient use efficiency estimates, especially with respect to nutrient removal in crop products, manure nutrient content, atmospheric deposition and crop biological N fixation rates.

This study evaluated Standardized Moisture Anomaly Index (SZI) using a combined water-energy balance approach, and compared the performance with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (ScPDSI) over seven climatic regions in China from 1948 to 2017. The atmospheric water demand in SZI is evaluated using climatically appropriate precipitation for existing conditions (CAFEC), which takes into account most parts of the surface water-energy balance (i.e., precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture recharge and loss). The relative performances of SZI, SPEI, and ScPDSI for multicategory and multi-scalar drought identification are reported in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient. Through a series of cross-comparisons, our result explains that the SZI, SPEI, and ScPDSI drought indices presented dissimilar abilities in different regions, which of course, raises the issue of regional applicability. The performance of SZI is better than SPEI and ScPDSI in both humid and non-humid regions. Although the consistency of SPEI is similar to SZI across different temporal scale, it is more appropriate for multi-scalar drought analysis in humid regions. The ScPDSI are inconsistent in identifying multicategory drought. The enhanced drought appraisal with the SZI is the consequence of a more objective evaluation of atmospheric water demand by incorporating precipitation, runoff, and change in water storage, all that control meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts, respectively. The SZI can offer a better multi-category and multi-scalar droughts information, which could aid in providing valuable early warning of rapidly evolving drought most notably in the water-limited region.",no,"The study is explicitly focused on a regional scale ('seven climatic regions in China'), failing the global coverage requirement.",

Generated fields are based on a data set consisting of rain gauge observations and path-averaged rain rates estimated using Commercial Microwave Link (CML) derived information. Precipitation fields are received as linear combination of unconditional spatial random fields, where the spatial dependence structure is described by copulas. The weights of the linear combination are optimized such that the observations and the spatial structure of the precipitation observations are reproduced. The innovation of the approach is that this strategy enables the simulation of ensembles of precipitation fields of any size. Each ensemble member is in concordance with the observed path-averaged CML derived rain rates and additionally reflects the observed rainfall variability along the CML paths. The ensemble spread allows additionally an estimation of the uncertainty of the reconstructed precipitation fields. The method is demonstrated both for a synthetic data set and a real-world data set in South Germany. While the synthetic example allows an evaluation against a known reference, the second example demonstrates the applicability for real-world observations. Generated precipitation fields of both examples reproduce the spatial precipitation pattern in good quality. A performance evaluation of Random Mixing compared to Ordinary Kriging demonstrates an improvement of the reconstruction of the observed spatial variability.

Moreover, the prediction of crop growth stages is related to the scheduling of planting and tillage, the determination of machine harvest time, and the prediction of crop yield. However, highly complex dynamics cause large volatility in meteorological factors, so it is very challenging to predict the crop growth stage accurately, based on weather data. To solve this problem, we propose a data-driven encoder-decoder model, using long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), which can be applied to forecast daily sunshine duration, cumulative precipitation, and average temperature for the coming year. To further test the performance of the ConvLSTM-based model, it is compared with the conventional LSTM encoder-decoder model and the convolutional neural network (CNN)-LSTM encoder-decoder model. The results demonstrate that, the ConvLSTM-based model is more accurate than the others for forecasting temperature (MAE = 2.602 degrees C, RMSE = 3.456 degrees C), precipitation (MAE = 3.878 mm, RMSE = 10.503 mm), and sunshine hours (MAE = 3.445 h, RMSE = 4.172 h) in 2014-2016. Furthermore, precise forecasting of meteorological factors allows us to develop a hybrid model and a data-driven model for the prediction of each growth stage separately. The hybrid model combines the ConvLSTM encoder-decoder model with empirical models, whereas the data-driven model comprises the ConvLSTM encoder-decoder model and traditional neural network structures. Finally, we compared the two types of models on a real-world dataset from Dandong, and concluded that the data-driven model is more accurate than the hybrid model for prediction of maize growth stages, with 12. 2 in the range of 0.755-0.883, MAE 0.588-2.205 days, and RMSE 0.978-2.729 days.

A global database on DC soybean studies collected from 1976 to 2017 was divided into three data sets: (i) FS and DC soybean (n = 141 data points); (ii) wheat and DC soybean (n = 463); and (iii) production factors and DC soybean (n = 547). Analysis showed that the yield gap between FS and DC soybeans increased from -31 to 1160 kg ha(-1) as FS yield improved from 1500 to 3000 kg ha(-1). Even though the proportion of the variation accounted for wheat yields in the DC soybean/wheat yield ratio was low (R-2 = 0.15), the probability of soybean yield being equal to wheat yield was 0, 20, 30, and 55% for wheat yields of >= 6, >= 4 and < 6, >= 2 and < 4, and < 2 Mg ha(-1).

A key indicator of soil productivity is soil organic carbon (SOC), which influences the provision of most soil ecosystem services. A major challenge in direct measurement of changes in SOC stock is that it is difficult to detect within a short timeframe relevant to land managers. In this study, we sought to identify suitable early indicators of changes in SOC stock and their drivers. A meta-analytical ap-proach was used to synthesize global data on the impacts of arable land conversion to other uses on total SOC stock, 12 different SOC fractions and three soil structural properties. The conversion of arable lands to forests and grasslands ac-counted for 91 % of the available land use change datasets used for the meta-analysis and were mostly from Asia and Europe. Land use change from arable lands led to 50 % (32-68 %) mean increase in both labile (microbial biomass C and particulate organic C - POC) and passive (microaggregate, 53-250 mu m diameter; and small macroaggregate, 250-2000 mu m diameter) SOC fractions as well as soil structural stability. There was also 37 % (24-50 %) mean increase in total SOC stock in the experimental fields where the various SOC fractions were measured. Only the POC and the organic carbon stored in small macroaggregates had strong correlation with total SOC: our findings reveal these two SOC fractions were predominantly controlled by biomass input to the soil rather than climatic factors and are thus suit-able candidate indicators of short-term changes in total SOC stock. Further field studies are recommended to validate the predictive power of the equations we developed in this study and the use of the SOC metrics under different land use change scenarios.",maybe,The abstract states it synthesizes 'global data' but also notes the datasets are 'mostly from Asia and Europe'.

Biodiversity potentially mediates these impacts by providing resilience to ecosystems. While biodiversity has been linked to resilience and ecosystem service supply on smaller scales, we lack understanding of whether mediating interactions between biodiversity and anthropogenic drivers are global and ubiquitous, and how they might differ between systems. Here, we examine the potential for biodiversity to mediate anthropogenic driver -ecosystem service relationships using global datasets across three distinct systems: mountains, islands and deltas. We found that driver-ecosystem service relationships were stronger where biodiversity was more intact, and weaker at higher species richness, reflecting the negative correlation between intactness and richness. Mediation was most common in mountains, then islands, then deltas; reducing with anthropogenic impact. Such patterns were found across provisioning and regulating ecosystem services, and occurred most commonly with climate change and built infrastructure. Further, we investigated the contribution of biodiversity and abiotic and anthropogenic drivers to ecosystem services. Ecosystem service supply was associated with abiotic and anthropogenic drivers alongside biodiversity, but all drivers were important to different ecosystem services. Our results empirically show the importance of accounting for the different roles that biodiversity plays in mediating human relationships with nature, and reinforce the importance of maintaining intact biodiversity in ecosystem functioning.",yes,"The abstract clearly states the use of 'global datasets' to examine relationships between drivers, biodiversity, and ecosystem services on a global scale.

Yet, effectively searching, navigating, and fully understanding various global datasets can be a daunting task for researchers and policy analysts. In this review, we first compare a few selected global data products, which use crop census and statistical data as the main data source, and identify key problems and challenges of the global crop mapping such as data accuracy and consistency. We then pointed out the future perspectives and directions in further improving the global cropping data products.

This paper aims to investigate the extent to which the centres of crop origin/diversity are congruent with areas of high CWR diversity. We established the predicted potential CWR distributions for 1,425 CWR species related to 167 crops using 334,527 known distribution locations and generated a global CWR hotspot map. This was then compared to the centres of origin/diversity proposed by Vavilov (amended by Hawkes); Zeven and Zhukovsky's mega gene centres, Harlan's centres and non-centres of crop domestication; and crop domestication areas identified using current archaeological evidence proposed by Purugganan and Fuller. Greatest congruence between the global CWR hotspots and other concepts was found with the concept proposed by Vavilov and amended by Hawkes, but there remained significant differences between the CWR hotspots and Vavilov's concept. This paper concludes that all four centre concepts reviewed have some overlap with CWR diversity but that Vavilov's original concept has the closest geographic coincidence with CWR hotspots. With the benefit of significant additional global datasets to those used by Vavilov, we were able to suggest amendments to his concept, adding further centres based on CWR hotspots in west and east USA, West Africa, South-east Brazil and Australia. As a result of this study more precise targeting of CWR and crop landrace can be implemented in future, aiding global food and nutritional security.",yes,The abstract describes the use of global datasets on crop wild relative distributions to generate a global hotspot map.,

But research quantifying the mechanisms behind such simultaneous shocks has been constrained by short records of crop yields. Here we compile a dataset of subnational crop yields in 25 countries dating back to 1900 to study the frequency and trends in multiple breadbasket yield shocks and how large-scale climate anomalies on interannual timescales have affected multiple breadbasket yield shocks over the last century. We find that major simultaneous breadbasket yield shocks have occurred in at least three, four, or five of nine breadbaskets 10.3%, 2.3% and 1.1% of the time for maize and 18.4%, 4.6% and 2.3% of the time for wheat. Furthermore, we find that multiple breadbasket yield shocks decreased in frequency even as those breadbaskets experience increasingly frequent climate-related shocks. For both maize and wheat breadbaskets, there were fewer simultaneous yield shocks during the 1975-2017 time period as compared to 1931-1975. Finally, we find that interannual modes of climate variability - such as the El Nin similar to o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) - have all affected the relative probability of simultaneous yield shocks in pairs of breadbaskets by up to 20-40% in both maize and wheat breadbaskets.

It is designed to overcome some limitations in existing Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) inversion methods, including the high dimensionality of the inverse problem, the convergence problem due to possible equifinality, and the dependence of some RTM variables on the crop-specific architecture. The PROSAIL model is first inverted in a calibration step using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm over a global dataset of ground GAI measurements (for maize, wheat, and rice) and the corresponding reflectance observations from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Quickbird to derive crop-specific distributions of PROSAIL input variables. These distributions were then used as prior information to predict GAI over an independent set of reflectance observations. Results show that the full Bayesian approach provides close estimates of GAI to ground truth, with respective Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.01, 1.33, and 0.97 for maize, wheat, and rice (R-2=0.67, 0.76 and 0.63, respectively). The performances are better than those approaches generally reported using radiative transfer models that are non-crop-specific, like the SNAP algorithm for Sentinel-2, but are slightly behind the purely empirical models based on machine learning. However, the proposed approach provides an explicit insight of the joint distribution of PROSAIL variables that are valid for any satellite platform. This constitutes a major advantage against purely empirical models, as it enables to fully exploit large observational datasets from multiple sensors and generalize to other platforms.",yes,"The abstract mentions the use of a 'global dataset of ground GAI measurements' for agricultural crops (maize, wheat, rice).",

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to simulate soil moisture, runoff and evapotranspiration, which were then used to compute three drought indices for historical drought assessment (1953-2016) and seasonal forecasting of drought. In the absence of observed soil moisture data, SWAT was first calibrated with streamflow data to derive reliable soil moisture estimates, and historical drought events were validated with the available reference drought index. Based on the calibrated results, the Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (MPDSI), Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI) and Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI) were estimated to evaluate the meteorological, agricultural and multivariate aspects, respectively, of drought. The total drought durations were 105-220 months, according to the reference drought index, and the estimated drought index captured 60-76% of these drought events. The three drought indices perform somewhat differently, but the 1991-1994 and 2015-2016 droughts were the worst drought events in the last 64 years based on analysis of the severity, duration and area of the meteorological and multivariate aspects of drought. The extreme droughts occurred in the Upper and Mid sections of the Lower Mekong sub-basins and the 3S region when there were consecutive precipitation and temperature anomalies that continued for more than 2 years. Spatial variability in precipitation deficits and temperature increases were random because these variables affect soil moisture differentially. In addition, 68.4-76.1% of the areas with increased drought were explained by the areas' precipitation decrease or temperature increase.

Among the many impacts of global warming on the region are projected changes in precipitation amount, variability, and timing, with potential to affect agriculture and food security. Using gridded daily precipitation for a historic period with future projections, we characterize the MSD across much of Central America using four measures: onset date, duration, intensity, and minimum, and test for significant changes by the end of the twenty-first century. Our findings indicate that the most significant changes are for the duration, which is projected to increase by an average of over a week, and the MSD minimum precipitation, which is projected to decrease by an average of over 26%, with statistically significant changes for the mountains and Pacific side in most of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala (assuming a higher emissions pathway through the twenty-first century).

Machine learning (ML) provides an alternative to empirical models and biogeochemical models, but it has not been used to simulate GHG emissions from paddy fields. In this study, a three-year field experiment dataset of paddy fields under controlled irrigation (CI, a kind of water-saving irrigation (WSI) technology) and flood irrigation (FI) in Kunshan, China, was collected, as well as a global dataset on WSI and FI. Then, the stacking ensemble model was developed based on three basic ML models, random forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor regression (KNN), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and a meta-learner, linear Regression (LR). Those models were used for the first time to simulate CH4 and N2O emissions on different time scales from paddy fields under WSI and FI. The results showed that the cumulative CH4 and N2O emissions from the WSI paddy fields decreased by 61.14% and increased by 19.52%, respectively, compared with FI. The ML algorithm can be applied to simulate daily, growth stages, and cumulative GHG emissions from paddy fields, but the performance of the linear regression model was worse than other ML models. Compared with the basic models, the stacking model improved the accuracy, improving the R2 by 0.37-13.36% and reducing the RMSE by 3.23-42.78%. Soil redox, temperature, and moisture are necessary for accurate modeling. Meanwhile, training the model using data from WSI and FI separately is beneficial to improve the accuracy of the model. The availability of the stacking model in other stations was verified based on literature data, with R2 varying between 0.7634 and 0.9985.

For each driver we assess differences in their importance among biomes, and use multiple linear regression to explain how driver importance varies with climate, soil and vegetation structure. We found that in most areas tree canopy conductance is better explained by VPD than by SWC or PPFD, although results for drylands were inconclusive. Climate, soil and vegetation structure were common controls for the importance of all three hydrometeorological drivers, with wetter climates, fine-textured soils and tall vegetation being associated with stronger influence of the driver on G.

Despite their importance, there is currently no estimate of the number of fishers engaged in mangrove associated fisheries, nor of the fishing intensity associated with mangroves at a global scale. We address these gaps by developing a global model of mangrove associated fisher numbers and mangrove fishing intensity. To develop the model, we undertook a three-round Delphi process with mangrove fisheries experts to identify the key drivers of mangrove fishing intensity. We then developed a conceptual model of intensity of mangrove fishing using those factors identified both as being important and for which appropriate global data could be found or developed. These factors were non-urban population, distance to market, distance to mangroves and other fishing grounds, and storm events. By projecting this conceptual model using geospatial datasets, we were able to estimate the number and distribution of mangrove associated fishers and the intensity of fishing in mangroves. We estimate there are 4.1 million mangrove associated fishers globally, with the highest number of mangrove fishers found in Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Brazil.

Perennial plants, which can be productive for many years without the need for replanting, can produce staple foods and environmental benefits, but their agronomic and nutritional properties haven't been considered synthetically in comparison to annual staples. Here we offer a framework to classify perennial staple crops according to their nutritional categories and cultivation status. We assemble literature to report on the yield potential of 51 perennial staple crops, only 15 of which are well-characterized in existing global datasets. We show the extent and distribution of perennial staple crop production in relation to annual crop types, calculate the carbon stocks they hold, and analyze their nutritional content for three macronutrients and nine micronutrients. We found that most perennial staple crops are regional crops (not globally traded) that grow in the subtropics to tropics. At least one perennial staple crop in each of the five nutritional categories has yields over 2.5 t/ha, in some cases considerably higher, competitive with and in many cases exceeding those of nutritionally comparable annual staples. Perennial staple crops only comprise similar to 4.5% of total cropland. They hold a modest similar to 11.4 GtC above and below ground, less than one third of the anthropogenic carbon-equivalent emissions for the year 2018, but more than the similar to 9 GtC held by the same amount of annual cropland. If linear growth in land under perennial staple production continues to 2040, and replaces only annual cropland, an additional similar to 0.95 GtC could be sequestered. Many perennial crops also had competitive macronutrient density and yield (per unit area) compared to annual staples; moreover, specific perennial staples are abundant in specific micronutrients, indicating that they can be a nutrient-dense part of diets, unlike the most ubiquitous annual staple crops (corn, wheat, rice) that do not appear in the top 85th percentile for any of the nine micronutrients analyzed. Transition of land and diets to perennial staple crops, if judiciously managed, can provide win-win solutions for both food production and ecosystems.",yes,"The abstract describes the use of existing global datasets to analyze the yield, distribution, and nutrition of perennial staple crops.",

Based on global datasets of official SDG-statistics, an operating framework combined planetary boundaries and the FEW nexus was constructed. We found that although there are substantial differences in the FEW nexus performances among various countries, the overall development of three branches is coordinated. However, the massive resource consumption associated with promotion of the FEW nexus can severely transgress multiple planetary boundaries. Optimistically, if the highest efficiency is considered, the conflict between biophysical resource consumption and FEW nexus will be alleviated. Therefore, considering the utilization efficiency and independent contribution of biophysical resource, we suggest that CO2 emissions, ecological footprint, material footprint, nitrogen, and phosphorus should be considered priorities among biophysical indicators for promoting FEW nexus within planetary boundaries.

Dichromate oxidation is also used to quantify black carbon (BC) in soil and sediments based on the larger resistance of BC to dichromate oxidation than uncharred SOC. The aim of this study was (i) to evaluate whether dichromate-based SOC quantification methods discriminate between uncharred SOC and charcoal residues in the topsoil of pre-industrial charcoal kiln sites and (ii) to test the influence of aging on the recovery of charcoal by dichromate oxidation. We selected 40 topsoil samples from 20 pre-industrial charcoal kiln sites of Wallonia, Belgium, and adjacent reference soils unaffected by charcoal production. Samples included soils from forest and cropland, with a diversity of soil types and textural classes. SOC content was estimated by the original Walkley-Black procedure (results were multiplied by the traditional correction factor of 1.32), and by an adapted method that includes external heating of the digestion mixture to overcome incomplete oxidation of uncharred SOC and get rid of the correction factor of 1.32. Results were compared to the amount of total organic carbon (TOC) content, measured by dry combustion, and to the content of charcoal-C in soil, estimated by differential scanning calorimetry. The soil of a currently active charcoal kiln site was also analyzed and used as a reference subject to limited aging. 23.6% of charcoal-C was recovered by the Walkley-Black procedure in the soil of the currently active kiln site against 65% for the soil of pre-industrial kiln sites, which indicates that the resistance of charcoal to dichromate oxidation decreases with aging. The recovery of charcoal increased to 90% after boiling of the digestion mixture, providing evidence that heat catalyzes the oxidation of charcoal. The substantial oxidation of charcoal by dichromate and the variability of recovery according to the degree of alteration of charcoal and conditions of reaction support the idea that the quantification of BC based on its chemical resistance is challenging and can be subject to important biases if calibration is not adapted to the quality of BC of the sample of interest. Because the recovery of BC by the Walkley-Black method is incomplete, the presence of large amounts of BC in soils frequently affected by fire might be a significant cause of underestimation of SOC by the Walkley-Black method in regional and global databases.",no,"The study is based on local data from Wallonia, Belgium, which does not meet the global coverage criterion.",

The uncertainty is partly due to the limited number and geographical bias of observations, and limited exploration of its predictors. Here we generated a comprehensive global database of 5,980 observations from 790 articles. The number of sites evaluated is at least seven times larger than in previous meta-analyses. Our constrained estimates of different LUC's effects on soil organic C (SOC) and their variations across global climates reveal underestimation/overestimation in previous estimates. Converting forests and grasslands to croplands reduced SOC by 24.5% +/- 1.53% (-11.03 +/- 1.06 Mg ha-1) and 22.7% +/- 1.22% (-8.09 +/- 0.67 Mg ha-1), while 28.0% +/- 1.56% (4.46 +/- 0.42 Mg ha-1) and 33.5% +/- 1.68% (5.8 +/- 0.38 Mg ha-1) increases, respectively, were obtained in the reverse processes. Converting forests to grasslands decreased SOC by 2.1% +/- 1.22% (-1.13 +/- 0.44 Mg ha-1), while the reverse process increased SOC by 18.6% +/- 1.73% (3.31 +/- 0.51 Mg ha-1). Modeled relative importance of 10 drivers of LUC's impact on SOC revealed that higher initial SOC (iSOC) does not solely determine SOC loss in SOC-negative LUC scenarios as previously proposed. Across four decades, reconverting croplands to forests and grasslands recovered only 49.5% (6.1 +/- 0.51 Mg ha-1) and 75.3% (7.0 +/- 0.38 Mg ha-1) of the iSOC, respectively, indicating the need for protecting C-rich ecosystems. Our global data set advances information on LUC's effect on SOC and can be valuable to constrain Earth system models to reliably estimate global SOC stocks and plan climate change mitigation strategies.Land use change (LUC) could increase or decrease the global soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and affect carbon cycling and climate change, but estimating its effect size is the most uncertain aspect of the global carbon cycle. Available estimates vary among studies, most of which often use few observations that do not cover most global regions. To provide more accurate estimates of different LUC types' effects on SOC, we compiled a comprehensive database that contains 5,980 observations across all global regions; and revealed that previous studies have underestimated/overestimated these effects. We modeled the predictors of SOC change and found that previous conclusions that higher initial SOC is the main reason for higher organic carbon loss under negative LUC scenarios were inexact. We show that land use practices aimed at restoring SOC could only recover part of the amount lost during similar time frames; hence, it is important to protect carbon-rich ecosystems. Our study provides robust estimates of LUC's effect on SOC and provides data sets that can reliably assess and model the global carbon cycle and plan strategies for controlling global climate change.Comprehensive global database advances robust estimates of land use change's (LUCs) effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) vital for Earth system modeling Higher initial SOC does not solely control rapid SOC loss in carbon-negative LUC as often proposed Despite SOC buildup in the past four decades, the amount lost cannot be regained by restoration during similar time frames",yes,The abstract describes the generation and use of a comprehensive global database of observations on soil organic carbon and land use change.,

The major results are as follows: the POC flux from global terrestrial biosphere rivers exports approximately 0.12-0.20 Pg C to oceans every year, including 0.20 Pg F-erosion, 0.17 Pg F-tss, and 0.12 Pg Frunoff. In contrast to earlier studies that the Pacific and Arctic Oceans are the main recipients of POC flux, we find that the Pacific and Atlantic received more POC flux and received 30.76%-62.51% and 26.77%-53.95%, respectively. This difference may be related to the combined effects of soil erosion, total suspended solids, and runoff. Asia exports more POC than other continents (60.50%-61.69%). The Amazon basin is the major contributor to the Atlantic POC, contributing 53.30%-58.68%. Furthermore, because of the intense human activities and the widespread distribution of many large watersheds in the highly eroded area, it was found that the POC flux has two key zones (25.75-41.5 degrees N and 4.50.N-13.50 degrees S) in the latitude zone. In summary, the above findings increase our understanding of the spatial redistribution of global organic carbon from land to sea.",yes,"The abstract mentions using the GEMS-GLORI database for a global study on soil erosion and carbon flux, which is relevant to agriculture.",GEMS-GLORI

Straw application is an important factor affecting soil MBC. Many studies have found that straw application increases soil MBC, although some studies suggest that straw application decreases soil MBC. This discrepancy underscores the need for a meta-analysis. A global dataset is established from 47 studies, compiling a total of 71 individual datasets. The results reveal that in tropical and temperate zones, the addition of maize, rice, and wheat straw causes a significant improvement in MBC content, although it has no effect on microbial community diversity. The research also indicates that MBC does not increase with the addition of straw of >10 Mg ha(-1); therefore, the amount of straw and nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilizer used should be appropriate. According to the analysis, the optimum usage is 10 Mg ha(-1). The best fertilization method consists of analyzing the soil fertility first and then adding NPK fertilizer appropriately according to the type and composition of straw application.",yes,The abstract describes the establishment of a global dataset from 47 studies to conduct a meta-analysis on straw application and soil microbial biomass.,

However, biodiversity decline due to deforestation and forest degradation of tropical forest is increasing at an alarming rate. Biodiversity dynamics due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances are mainly monitored using established field survey approaches. However, such approaches appear to fall short at addressing complex disturbance factors and responses. We argue that the integration of state-of-the-art monitoring approaches can improve the detection of subtle biodiversity disturbances and responses in changing tropical forests, which are often data-poor. We assess the state-of-the-art technologies used to monitor biodiversity dynamics of changing tropical forests, and how their potential integration can increase the detail and accuracy of biodiversity monitoring. Moreover, the relevance of these biodiversity monitoring techniques in support of the UNCBD Aichi targets was explored using the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) as a framework. Our review indicates that although established field surveys were generally the dominant monitoring systems employed, the temporal trend of monitoring approaches indicates the increasing application of remote sensing and in -situ sensors in detecting disturbances related to agricultural activities, logging, hunting and infrastructure. The relevance of new technologies (i.e., remote sensing, in situ sensors, and DNA barcoding) in operationalising EBVs (especially towards the ecosystem structure, ecosystem function, and species population classes) and the Aichi targets has been assessed. Remote sensing application is limited for EBV classes such as genetic composition and species traits but was found most suitable for ecosystem structure class. The complementarity of remote sensing and emerging technologies were shown in relation to EBV candidates such as species distribution, net primary productivity, and habitat structure. We also developed a framework based on the primary biodiversity attributes, which indicated the potential of integration between monitoring approaches. In situ sensors are suitable to help measure biodiversity composition, while approaches based on remote sensing are powerful for addressing structural and functional biodiversity attributes. We conclude that, synergy between the recent biodiversity monitoring approaches is important and possible. However, testing the suitability of monitoring methods across scales, integrating heterogeneous monitoring technologies, setting up metadata standards, and making interpolation and/or extrapolation from observation at different scales is still required to design a robust biodiversity monitoring system that can contribute to effective conservation measures.",no,"The abstract describes a review of biodiversity monitoring approaches and technologies, not the use or production of a specific dataset for analysis.",

Although tropical forest products frequently become over-exploited, only few studies explicitly address the dynamics of degradation in response to socio-economic drivers. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing the factors driving changes in tropical forest products in the perception of rural smallholder communities. Using the poverty and environment network global dataset, we studied recently perceived trends of forest product availability considering firewood, charcoal, timber, food, medicine, forage and other forest products. We looked at a pan-tropical sample of 233 villages with forest access. Our results show that 90% of the villages experienced declining availability of forest resources over the last five years according to the informants. Timber and fuelwood together with forest foods were featured as the most strongly affected, though with marked differences across continents. In contrast, availability of at least one main forest product was perceived to increase in only 39% of the villages. Furthermore, the growing local use of forest resources is seen as the main culprit for the decline. In villages with both growing forest resource use and immigration-vividly illustrating demographic pressures-the strongest forest resources degradation was observed. Conversely, villages with little or no population growth and a decreased use of forest resources were most likely to see significant forest-resource increases. Further, villages are less likely to perceive resource declines when local communities own a significant share of forest area. Our results thus suggest that perceived resource declines have only exceptionally triggered adaptations in local resource-use and management patterns that would effectively deal with scarcity. Hence, at the margin this supports neo-Malthusian over neo-Boserupian explanations of local resource-use dynamics.",yes,The abstract explicitly states the use of the 'poverty and environment network global dataset' for a pan-tropical study on forest resources.,poverty and environment network global dataset

We assembled a global database of historical Tephritidae invasions with the objective to identify biological and socioeconomic drivers that explain invasions. We investigate the tendencies of certain species to invade and the characteristics of regions that make them more prone to invasions. Our database documented the occurrence (presence/absence) and status (native/non-native) of individual Tephritidae species in each country in the world. Values of several socioeconomic and environmental variables were also assembled and considered as explanatory variables. A generalized linear mixed-effects model framework was used to evaluate the utility of these variables for predicting the country-level occurrence of each species outside of its native range. A total of 44 species were identified as having been accidentally introduced. Most species of invading Tephritidae have established in five or fewer countries. The number of invasions has rapidly increased since the 1950s. Climatic similarity between native and invaded countries and gross domestic product of the invaded country significantly increased the incidence of invasion, whereas distance to the native range had a negative effect on the probability that a given country would be invaded. Our analysis revealed that both economic and biological factors explain patterns of historical Tephritid invasions.

The source of the outbreak in Hawaii is not known, and CLR could have entered Hawaii from more than 50 coffee-producing nations that harbor the pathogen. To determine the source(s) of the Hawaii inoculum, we analyzed a set of eleven simple sequence repeat markers (SSRs) generated from Hawaii isolates within a dataset of 434 CLR isolates collected from 17 countries spanning both old and new world populations, and then conducted a minimum spanning network (MSN) analysis to trace the most likely pathway that H. vastatrix could have taken to Hawaii. Forty-two multilocus genotypes (MLGs) of H. vastatrix were found in the global dataset, with all isolates from Hawaii assignable to MLG 10 or derived from it. MLG 10 is widespread in Central America and Jamaica, making this region the most probable source of inoculum for the outbreak in Hawaii. An examination of global weather patterns during the months preceding the introduction of CLR makes it unlikely that the pathogen was windborne to the islands.

High capital spending for desalination and water conflicts leading to asset stranding have recently occurred. Investors in mining companies are interested in the exposure to such risks across portfolios of mining assets (whether the practical at-site consequences are foregone production, higher OPEX and CAPEX and ensuing lost revenues, or asset-stranding). In this paper, an index of the potential financial exposure of a portfolio is developed and its application is illustrated. Since the likely loss at each mine is hard to estimate a priori, one needs a proxy for potential loss. The index considers drought duration, severity and frequency (defined by a return-level in years) at each mining asset, and provides a measure of financial exposure through weighing of production or Net Asset Value. Changes in human needs are not considered, but are relevant, and could be incorporated if global data on mine and other water use were available at the appropriate resolution. Potential for contemporaneous drought incidence across sites in a portfolio is considered specifically. Through an appropriate choice of drought thresholds, an analyst can customize a scenario to assess potential losses in production value or profits, or whether conflicts could emerge that would lead to stranded assets or capital expenditure to secure alternate water supplies.

The uncertainty factors of the crop model data assimilation was analyzed by considering the observation errors, assimilation stages and temporal-spatial scales. Overall, the results indicated a better yield estimate performance when the EnKF-based strategy was used to comprehensively consider several factors in the initial conditions and observations.

The algorithm was coupled with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model and is capable of solving the multi-objective calibration problem for crop models. Understanding how model parameters are determined from past research work is especially difficult because parameter determination is usually performed by manual trial and error methods and still remains a black box. Single-objective functions are often inadequate to properly measure all characteristics of the observed datasets and do not usually provide parameter estimates that are considered acceptable. In contrast, a multi-criteria optimization would allow the analysis of the trade-offs among different criteria, and would indicate the limitations of the current crop model structure better. Therefore, a multi-objective algorithm was used in this study to identify the critical model parameters and to glean a better understanding of model uncertainties. The uncertainty analysis of the model was performed by comparing simulation results obtained using randomly generated initial parameters and inputs with the attainable calibrated parameters and inputs. Three model parameters (biomass to energy ratio (BE), harvest index (HI), potential heat units (PHU)) and two inputs (planting dates (PDAY), planting density (PDENS)) were optimized on a grid-scale to capture a more realistic spatial pattern and temporal variability of corn yield. The conclusions derived from this study are: (1) the critical parameters needed to reproduce corn yield with EPIC are BE, HI, and PHU; (2) the MOCOM-UA calibration procedure is highly effective in improving the spatial agreement and temporal variability of corn yield and for reducing the width of the uncertainty band; (3) by using the calibrated parameter sets, measurement errors of spatial averaged ensemble mean yield are significantly improved; (4) simulation using the EPIC model showed better performance in the major corn area with relatively accurate input datasets, but performed poorly in the minor corn area with lower yield and corn area ratio. This study highlights the projected contribution of the multi-objective optimization procedure in identifying critical model parameters in reducing the width of the uncertainty band, and in improving the spatial agreement and temporal variability of corn yield.

Here, we revised an approach published earlier (called here GPASOIL-v0), in which several global datasets describing these drivers were combined with a process model for soil P dynamics to reconstruct the past and current distribution of P in cropland and grassland soils. The objective of the present update, called GPASOIL-v1, is to incorporate recent advances in process understanding about soil inorganic P dynamics, in datasets to describe the different drivers, and in regional soil P measurements for benchmarking. We trace the impact of the update on the reconstructed soil P. After the update we estimate a global averaged inorganic labile P of 187 kgP ha-1 for cropland and 91 kgP ha-1 for grassland in 2018 for the top 0-0.3 m soil layer, but these values are sensitive to the mineralization rates chosen for the organic P pools. Uncertainty in the driver estimates lead to coefficients of variation of 0.22 and 0.54 for cropland and grassland, respectively.

The simulation and prediction of LULC in a large-scale basin in an arid zone can help the future land management planning and rational allocation of resources in this ecologically fragile region. Using the whole Ili-Balkhash Basin as the study area, the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model and a combination of PLUS and Markov predictions (PLUS-Markov) were used to simulate and predict land use in 2020 based on the assessment of the accuracy of LULC classification in the global dataset. The accuracy of simulations and predictions using the model were measured for LULC data covering different time periods. Model settings with better simulation results were selected for simulating and predicting possible future land use conditions in the basin. The future predictions for 2025 and 2030, which are based on historical land change characteristics, indicate that the overall future spatial pattern of LULC in the basin remains relatively stable in general without the influence of other external factors. Over the time scale of the future five years, the expansion of croplands and barren areas in the basin primarily stems from the loss of grasslands. Approximately 48% of the converted grassland areas are transformed into croplands, while around 40% are converted into barren areas. In the longer time scale of the future decade, the conversion of grasslands to croplands in the basin is also evident. However, the expansion phenomenon of urban and built-up lands at the expense of croplands is more significant, with approximately 774.2 km(2) of croplands developing into urban and built-up lands. This work provides an effective new approach for simulating and predicting LULC in data-deficient basins at a large scale in arid regions, thereby establishing a foundation for future research on the impact of human activities on basin hydrology and related studies.",yes,"The abstract mentions using a global dataset for land use/land cover classification, which is relevant to agriculture and land management.",

Small changes to food trade and refugee resettlement policies can alleviate this unequal burden.Millions of people displaced by conflicts have found refuge in water-scarce countries, where their perceived effect on water availability has shaped local water security discourses. Using an annual global data set, we explain the effects of refugee migrations on the host countries' water stress through the food demand displaced by refugees and the water necessary to produce that food. The water footprint of refugee displacement increased by nearly 75% globally between 2005 and 2016. Although minimal in most countries, implications can be severe in countries already facing severe water stress. For example, refugees may have contributed up to 75 percentage points to water stress in Jordan.

E.",2018,"Sufficient and accurate hydro-meteorological data are essential to manage water resources. Recently developed global reanalysis datasets have significant potential in providing these data, especially in regions such as Southern Africa that are both vulnerable and data poor. These global reanalysis datasets have, however, not yet been exhaustively validated and it is thus unclear to what extent these are able to adequately capture the climatic variability of water resources, in particular for extreme events such as floods. This article critically assesses the potential of a recently developed global Water Resources Reanalysis (WRR) dataset developed in the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7) eartH2Observe (E2O) project for identifying floods, focussing on the occurrence of floods in the Limpopo River basin in Southern Africa. The discharge outputs of seven global models and ensemble mean of those models as available in the WRR dataset are analysed and compared against two benchmarks of flood events in the Limpopo River basin. The first benchmark is based on observations from the available stations, while the second is developed based on flood events that have led to damages as reported in global databases of damaging flood events. Results show that, while the WRR dataset provides useful data for detecting the occurrence of flood events in the Limpopo River basin, variation exists amongst the global models regarding their capability to identify the magnitude of those events. The study also reveals that the models are better able to capture flood events at stations with a large upstream catchment area. Improved performance for most models is found for the 0.25 degrees resolution global model, when compared to the lower-resolution 0.5 degrees models, thus underlining the added value of increased-resolution global models. The skill of the global hydrological models (GHMs) in identifying the severity of flood events in poorly gauged basins such as the Limpopo can be used to estimate the impacts of those events using the benchmark of reported damaging flood events developed at the basin level, though this could be improved if further details on location and impacts are included in disaster databases. Large-scale models such as those included in the WRR dataset are used by both global and continental forecasting systems, and this study sheds light on the potential these have in providing information useful for local-scale flood risk management. In conclusion, this study offers valuable insights in the applicability of global reanalysis data for identifying impacting flood events in data-sparse regions.",yes,"The abstract explicitly mentions the use and assessment of a global Water Resources Reanalysis (WRR) dataset, which is relevant to agriculture.",Water Resources Reanalysis; eartH2Observe

Driven by rapidly accumulating single-cell datasets, recent attempts to infer cell type evolution have largely been limited to pairwise comparisons because we lack approaches to build cell phylogenies using model-based approaches. Here we approach the challenges of applying explicit phylogenetic methods to single-cell data by using principal components as phylogenetic characters. We infer a cell phylogeny from a large, comparative single-cell dataset of eye cells from five distantly related mammals. Robust cell type clades enable us to provide a phylogenetic, rather than phenetic, definition of cell type, allowing us to forgo marker genes and phylogenetically classify cells by topology. We further observe evolutionary relationships between diverse vessel endothelia and identify the myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells as sister cell types. Finally, we examine principal component loadings and describe the gene expression dynamics underlying the function and identity of cell type clades that have been conserved across the five species. A cell phylogeny provides a rigorous framework towards investigating the evolutionary history of cells and will be critical to interpret comparative single-cell datasets that aim to ask fundamental evolutionary questions.The authors apply explicit phylogenetic methods to single-cell transcriptomic data of eye cells to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cell types in distantly related mammals.",no,"The dataset used is on eye cells from mammals, which is not related to agriculture or closely related fields like climate or soil.",

By contrast, other elements responded to latitude in a contrary manner as nitrogen and phosphorus, in line with a competing mechanism, temperature-biogeochemistry hypothesis. Besides, plant functional types intrinsically differed in mineral concentrations, and to a certain extent, shifts of their composition in turn exacerbated the latitudinal patterns of respective elements as predicted by the species composition hypothesis.Main conclusions: The fundamentally different dynamics and control mechanisms of patterns of some elements compared with those of nitrogen and phosphorus chal-lenge the idea that common hypotheses can predict biogeographic patterns across all mineral elements; thus, current paradigms of element biogeochemical models and ecological plant nutrition require revision.",yes,"The abstract describes the compilation of a global data set of leaf mineral elements, climate, and soil indices, which is directly relevant to agriculture.",

Our original research aims to study the elemental composition of a certain taxonomic group of marine diatoms, whose representatives make a significant contribution to primary production in the Arctic Ocean. The data on the chemical composition of diatom microalgae are discussed concerning their role in the global biogeochemical circulation of elements in the ocean. In particular, the obtained data make a prominent input to the study of the multi-element composition of marine diatom species, namely Chaetoceros spp., inhabiting the shelf seas of the Arctic Ocean. These data may be used as a basis for the cultivation of marine diatom strains for obtaining commercially promising producers of biogenic silica or valuable biological products that can be used as raw materials in the production of feed and nutrition for agriculture and aquaculture. Data on the elemental composition of the diatom Chaetoceros spp. from natural phytoplankton communities of Arctic marine ecosystems are presented for the first time. Samples were collected during the 69th cruise (22 August-26 September 2017) of the R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh in the Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian Seas. The multi-element composition of the diatom microalgae was studied by ICP-AES and ICP-MS methods.

We related these to climate data spanning 30 years (1981 to 2010), consisting of daily minimum temperature, maximum temperature and precipitation, modelled for the four communities using global databases and regional meteorological data. We found that farmers' climate perceptions showed considerable spatial and gender differences. Perceptions matched well with records describing climate variability, particularly in terms of the shortening and the increased variability of the rainy season, as well as the occurrence of extreme drought in recent years. Climate change, described by long-term average increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation, was perceived, but with subordinate priority. Perceived climate impacts included reduced crop yield, increased occurrence of pests and diseases and increased crop damage by extreme events and poverty. Adaptations were mainly land based and included agronomic measures, land management and ecosystem restoration. Furthermore, important gender differences in adaptation could be traced back to typical gender roles. Results highlight the risk of broadcast adaptation programs, such as the government-propagated combination of mineral fertilizers and early maturing crop varieties.

Because of the scattered results and the lack of a general conclusion from the published results, conducting a meta-analysis as a structured method for arriving at an overall conclusion regarding the effects of different fertigation methods on different indices is essential. This study was conducted to examine the effects of surface and drip fertigation methods and different fertilizer application levels on crop yield, NUE, and WP. To this end, eight global databases of publications (e.g., Scopus and Web of Science) were reviewed.

Our study found that crops' wild progenitors already had high leaf nitrogen, photosynthesis, conductance and transpiration and soft leaves. After domestication, ecophysiological traits varied little and in idiosyncratic ways. Crops did not surpass the trait boundaries of wild species. Overall, the resource-acquisitive strategy of crops is largely due to the inheritance from their wild progenitors rather than to further breeding improvements.

GANs has received wide attention due to their outstanding ability to produce realistic-looking images and can implicitly learn rich distributions over Spatio-Temporal (ST) correlations in Multivariate Time Series (MTS). Forecasting using MTS remains a challenge that needs to be solved to make successful tasks in different ST related applications such as vegetation forecasting. Vegetation is an extremely valuable component of our global ecosystem, as well as an important indicator of land cover change dynamics and productivity. As a result, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one of the most widely used indices in vegetation related studies. The challenges of accurately forecasting vegetation indices come from both the non-stationary ST correlations of the NDVI data and the complex impact of the external context factors, including weather and remote sensing indices. It is further more challenging for most existing one-step forecasting methods, making an accurate forecast over many future time slots. To achieve this goal, we propose a new multi-attention GAN model composed of three main parts. An encoder network first encodes the driving sequence into latent space vectors and store all the information carried by the driving sequence. A generator is then in charge of generating forecasting data by extracting long-term temporal patterns. Eventually, in order to increase forecasting accuracy, we use as a third part an improved discriminator for classification and feedback purposes. The suggested model has been extensively tested with real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness compared to existing methods. The test results indicate high performance with a Coefficient of Determination (R2) of 0.95, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.04, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.01, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.35.",maybe,"The abstract mentions testing the model with 'real-world datasets' for vegetation forecasting, but it does not specify the geographic coverage of these datasets.",

In South America, a region which includes many biodiversity hotspots (e.g., Atlantic Forest, Andes), agriculture, mining, oil and gas exploitation, dam construction, and settlements have been expanding and intensifying within and around PAs. These human activities need infrastructure (e.g., buildings, logistic facilities, ports), which leads to increased pressure on PAs. In this study, we used nighttime light data and the World Database on Protected Areas to evaluate the extent of intrusion of infrastructure in PAs in South America between 2001 and 2011. Our results show that in general PAs in all of the seven IUCN categories are buffering the intrusion of infrastructure within them, but this was not the case for PAs in multiple-use categories where there was a considerable increase in infrastructure within these PAs. The largest increase in infrastructure occurred within the first 60 km from the border of the PAs, and for multiple-use categories, the peak occurred in the first 10 km. In addition, infrastructure expansion around PAs in category I showed more variability and the largest extent. Infrastructure expansion within and around PAs varied among countries. There were only 23 of the 2,902 PAs with zero expansion, 16 were located in Brazil, four in Colombia, and one in Suriname, Venezuela, and French Guiana. Ecuador and Venezuela were the two countries that had the most infrastructure expansion within and around their PAs, while Guyana and French Guiana had the least development. Presently, South America has similar to 22% of the land area under some type of protection.

We consider a series of proposed MPA network expansions of various sizes, and we forecast the impact this increase in protection would have on global patterns of fishing effort. We do so by building a predictive machine learning model trained on a global dataset of satellite-based fishing vessel monitoring data, current MPA locations, and spatiotemporal environmental, geographic, political, and economic features. We then use this model to predict future fishing effort under various MPA expansion scenarios compared to a business-as-usual counterfactual scenario that includes no new MPAs. The difference between these scenarios represents the predicted change in fishing effort associated with MPA expansion. We find that regardless of the MPA network objectives or size, fishing effort would decrease inside the MPAs, though by much less than 100%. Moreover, we find that the reduction in fishing effort inside MPAs does not simply redistribute outside-rather, fishing effort outside MPAs would also decline. The overall magnitude of the predicted decrease in global fishing effort principally depends on where networks are placed in relation to existing fishing effort. MPA expansion will lead to a global redistribution of fishing effort that should be accounted for in network design, implementation, and impact evaluation.",yes,"The abstract describes using a 'global dataset of satellite-based fishing vessel monitoring data' to study fishing effort, which is related to food production and meets the inclusion criteria without violating exclusion criteria.",

For this purpose, traditional monitoring methods are widely established and can provide data with a high taxonomic resolution. However, processing of captured insect samples is often time-consuming and expensive, which limits the number of potential replicates. Automated monitoring methods can facilitate data collection at a higher spatiotemporal resolution with a comparatively lower effort and cost. Here, we present the Insect Detect DIY (do-it-yourself) camera trap for non-invasive automated monitoring of flower-visiting insects, which is based on low-cost off-the-shelf hardware components combined with open-source software. Custom trained deep learning models detect and track insects landing on an artificial flower platform in real time on-device and subsequently classify the cropped detections on a local computer. Field deployment of the solar-powered camera trap confirmed its resistance to high temperatures and humidity, which enables autonomous deployment during a whole season. On-device detection and tracking can estimate insect activity/abundance after metadata post-processing. Our insect classification model achieved a high top-1 accuracy on the test dataset and generalized well on a real-world dataset with captured insect images. The camera trap design and open-source software are highly customizable and can be adapted to different use cases.

Here we use a unique global dataset3 to show that vascular plants on oceanic islands exhibit a weakened LDG and explore potential mechanisms for this effect. Our results show that traditional physical drivers of island biogeography4-namely area and isolation-contribute to the difference between island and mainland diversity at a given latitude (that is, the island species deficit), as smaller and more distant islands experience reduced colonization. However, plant species with mutualists are underrepresented on islands, and we find that this plant mutualism filter explains more variation in the island species deficit than abiotic factors. In particular, plant species that require animal pollinators or microbial mutualists such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi contribute disproportionately to the island species deficit near the Equator, with contributions decreasing with distance from the Equator. Plant mutualist filters on species richness are particularly strong at low absolute latitudes where mainland richness is highest, weakening the LDG of oceanic islands. These results provide empirical evidence that mutualisms, habitat heterogeneity and dispersal are key to the maintenance of high tropical plant diversity and mediate the biogeographic patterns of plant diversity on Earth.The effect of the latitudinal diversity gradient on plants on oceanic islands is weakened by classical abiotic physical drivers of island biogeography and, to a greater extent, by mutualism with other species.",yes,"The abstract states the use of 'a unique global dataset' of vascular plants, which meets all inclusion criteria and does not violate any exclusion criteria.",

Here we compiled a global dataset of the responses of plant biomass and biomass allocation to the experimental drought from 281 studies conducted on 329 wild species and conducted both traditional and phylogenetic meta-analyses to explore the potential role of evolutionary history in affecting the differences among PFTs and the regulation effects of environmental conditions. We found that there were no consistent differences in biomass responses to drought between gymnosperm and angiosperm woody plants when the traditional meta-analysis was applied. Taking the phylogenetic information (the proxy of evolutionary history) into account resulted in more sensitive responses in gymnosperms than angiosperms but with great uncertainty, probably due to the high hydraulic diversity in both groups. The observed higher drought sensitivity in evergreen gymnosperms than deciduous ones, and in C3 herbs than in C4 ones were mainly derived from the phylogenetic relatedness among species. The influences of drought intensity were prevalent in both traditional and phylogenetic meta-analyses. These results highlight the vital role of plant evolutionary history played in affecting plant responses to drought.

Seedling transplantation in conjunction one or more restoration interventions (RIs) remains the method of choice at most sites, and thus the initial months following transplantation, when seedlings are especially vulnerable to drought and animal damage, are a critical time for determining restoration success. To this end, we evaluated the survival, growth, and animal damage of 3600 native seedlings of 24 thornforest species in response to RIs incorporating a combination of seedling shelters and slow-release moisture, as well as a mycorrhizae-biostimulant admixture (MBS). We surveyed seedlings on a bi-monthly basis over one year following planting at a semi-arid upland site in the LRGV. We found that while shelters had a pronounced and lasting impact on height growth (increased by 15?27% on average), reduction of mortality by seedling shelter RIs was only modest (reduced on average by 5?12% per species), with significant benefits accruing from cocoon shelters only, which provide slow-release moisture to the seedling roots during the initial month after planting. Species-specific responses were the most variable, with mortality ranging from 8 to 69%. While shelters in some cases reduced mammalian herbivory, the growth of leggier stems and degradation of biodegradable shelters may reduce their overall efficacy. We conclude that thornforest restoration may be most effective when seedling performance is considered in species selection and costly restoration interventions are applied on species-specific basis. These results contribute an important first step towards optimizing forest restoration efforts in the LRGV on the basis of species identity and kickstart a species-specific database of seedling demographic responses in semiarid forest restoration.",no,"The study and the database it creates are explicitly local to the Lower Rio Grande Valley of south Texas, which violates the global coverage exclusion criterion.",

Testing hypotheses of equivalence rather than difference is the appropriate statistical approach. A necessary first step in this regard is to specify a reasonable equivalence criterion that includes a measure for discrepancy between the GM and reference crops as well as a regulatory threshold. The present work explored several equivalence criteria and discussed their pros and cons. Each criterion addresses one of three ordered classes of equivalence: super, conditional and marginal equivalence. Their implications were investigated over an array of parameter values estimated from a real-world dataset. Marginal equivalence was identified as adhering most closely to the concept of substantial equivalence. Because conditional equivalence logically implies marginal equivalence and is practically quantifiable from current field designs, the present work recommends conditional equivalence criteria while encouraging producers to improve their design to enable testing marginal equivalence in the future.

In this study, we mapped carbon stocks to infer land degradation in a small area in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. The study aimed to assess carbon stock status and to identify limitations and advantages of using global data in mapping at local scale relative to using local data. Two different datasets were developed; i) a global dataset characterised by data from datasets with global coverage data, and ii) a hybrid dataset that coupled data from global datasets, soil data derived from a local survey, and land cover data derived from a supervised classification of satellite images. The results showed that i) global datasets introduced inaccuracy that must be taken into account for advocating interventions at a local scale, and ii) global datasets could be used at a small catchment level for decision-making, if a simple rank of values is sufficient, but they might provide an optimistic picture of land degradation because they overestimate stocks.",yes,"The abstract clearly states the use of 'global datasets' for assessing land degradation and carbon stocks, which are relevant to agriculture.

Efforts to improve livestock nutrition are often driven by supply-push thinking and fail to engage meaningfully with farmers and the realities they face. The Feed Assessment Tool (FEAST) was developed as a way of involving farmers more closely in decision making on livestock feed improvement. FEAST is a participatory tool which uses focus group discussions and individual farmer interviews to develop a broad overview of the livestock farming system. FEAST has been applied in many countries in the last 10 years. Examples of intensive use come from the Accelerated Value Chain Development Project in Kenya and the Rwanda Dairy Development Project in Rwanda. In both cases the tool was used to inform feed options with strong input from farmers. Although the primary purpose of FEAST is to support improved feed strategies at farm level, the data collected through the FEAST app and published in FEAST reports are a rich information resource that can be useful for developing broader system-level understanding of livestock feed issues.

M.; DeVries, Trevor J.; Barkema, Herman W.; Deardon, Rob",2022,"With growing adoption of precision dairy technologies, the use of big data is becoming increasingly common in the dairy industry. The speed at which data are generated has led to increased interest in developing detection and predictive models for animal health and disease events using real time records. When combining data from multiple sources, statistical methods exist to account for the underlying heterogeneity in data collected from commercial farms, although its impact on predictive models is not known. We investigated how 4 different issues commonly seen in these large datasets impact the performance of deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to detect the onset of clinical mastitis (CM) in dairy cows. Data were simulated by first sampling from real-world data and adding noise, then defining the association between predictor variables and CM while incorporating parameters to reflect underlying heterogeneity: 1) random effects to reflect unmeasured variability at the farm level (3 levels - none, moderate, high); 2) random effects to reflect unmeasured variability at the cow level (3 levels - none, moderate, high); 3) missed recording of CM cases (3 false-negative rates - 0.10, 0.25, 0.50); and 4) incomplete observations due to certain farms not having a somatic cell count sensor (SCC data missing vs SCC data included). At baseline (moderate farm and cow random effects; moderate misclassification; 42% herds with SCC sensor) the model achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 90% respectively. Higher levels of unmeasured variability at the farm and cow levels resulted in reduced model performance (sensitivity and specificity of 76% and 85% at the highest levels), indicating that data collection and feature selection should be informed by previous knowledge of the associations between the outcome and predictors when possible, and that model performance may be limited when predictors are selected only from routinely collected data. However, even when 50% of CM cases were incorrectly recorded as CM-negative, model performance did not decrease, demonstrating that deep RNNs are robust to the level of misclassification that would be typically encountered in dairy datasets. RNNs were also able to accurately detect CM onset even when a highly predictive variable, somatic cell count, was excluded from training and test data, but the models took longer to train. The effect of unmeasured variability on model performance demonstrates how predictors should be selected for RNNs, whereas RNNs appear to be very robust to misclassification in training data as well as missing variables. Researchers developing studies using deep learning should therefore focus their attention more on predictor selection than on reducing or standardizing outcome recording, since RNNs appear to be robust to the latter, while being more strongly impacted by the former.",maybe,"The abstract discusses using real-world and simulated data for dairy applications, which fits the agricultural theme.

However, UAV images have a lower spatial resolution than similarly equipped in field ground-based vehicle systems, such as carts, because of their distance from the crop canopy, which can be particularly problematic for measuring small-sized plant features. In this study, the performance of three deep learning-based super resolution models, employed as a pre-processing tool to enhance the spatial resolution of low resolution images of three different kinds of crops were evaluated. To train a super resolution model, aerial images employing two separate sensors co-mounted on a UAV flown over lentil, wheat and canola breeding trials were collected. A software workflow to pre-process and align real-world low resolution and high-resolution images and use them as inputs and targets for training super resolution models was created. To demonstrate the effectiveness of real-world images, three different experiments employing synthetic images, manually downsampled high resolution images, or real-world low resolution images as input to the models were conducted. The performance of the super resolution models demonstrates that the models trained with synthetic images cannot generalize to real-world images and fail to reproduce comparable images with the targets.

However, to date, there is no comprehensive, large-scale evaluation on the effects of climate warming on the cropping systems of Iran. The objective of the current study was to quantify the effects of climate warming on the length of the growing period and grain yield of maize. We also tested the potential of changes in irrigation, nitrogen application rate, and using late maturity cultivars of maize to offset the negative impact of climate warming in order to maintain the current levels of grain yield (4 to 10tha(-1) depending upon the province) in Iran. The crop modeling framework SIMPLACE was used to evaluate the effects of the warming temperatures, nitrogen application rate, and changes in thermal requirements of the cultivar scenario combinations on grain yield of maize in Iran. The climate, soil, and management inputs of the crop model were obtained from global datasets as grid cells at 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees resolution, and the outputs of the crop model were aggregated to the province level. Results of the grain yield projections showed a decline (-0.1 to -22%) in maize, especially in the Southern provinces (Khuzestan, Fars, and Kerman) under different warming scenarios by +0.5 to +2 degrees C, an increase from the baseline. The grain yield decline appeared to be mainly driven by a shortening of the length of the growing season and extreme heat stress during anthesis, the most sensitive period of crop growth. Increasing temperatures during the growing season lead to a marginal increase of absolute irrigation requirements over the maize growing areas. For all provinces, application of 10-25% more nitrogen than the current rate (170kgN/ha(-1)) was able to offset the negative effects of higher temperatures (+0.5 and +1.0 degrees C) during the growing season. However, the increased nitrogen application rates were not able to maintain the baseline level of grain yield under the +1.5 and +2.0 degrees C warming scenarios. Introducing late maturity cultivars, which required 20% more temperature sum than current cultivars to reach maturity, improved the grain yield in the cooler provinces by up to 10%. In conclusion, the grain yield baseline level may not be maintained under the highest magnitude of warming by increasing nitrogen application rates or using late maturity cultivars. Furthermore, more water is needed to produce a unit of grain under a warming climate. This study also suggests that combined adaptation strategies should be considered by policymakers in order to mitigate the negative impact of climate warming on the cropping systems of Iran.",yes,The abstract states that the crop model used for the study was fed with inputs obtained from 'global datasets' to assess maize yield.

Accurate measurement of soil pH is essential for effective soil assessment, management and crop production. This review of soil pH focuses on techniques and challenges for measurement and utilises insights from a comprehensive global soil dataset (n = 655,336). Soil pH has a global average of 6.36 with considerable regional variability. A Random Forest model of the global dataset identified total carbonate content, rainfall, evaporation, clay and organic carbon content as key drivers of soil pH (R-2 = 0.77, mean absolute error = 0.46 pH units). The advantages and limitations of various soil pH measurement methods (e.g., glass and solid-state electrodes, colorimetric and spectrophotometric methods, infrared spectroscopy, remote sensing and specialised field assessment methods) are discussed. Care should be taken in choosing appropriate pH measurement techniques depending on the purpose of the measurement and nature of the soils. The use of electrolytes (e.g., CaCl2 and KCl) introduces variable changes in measured pH and, on average globally, pH measured in a 1:5 soil:0.01 M CaCl2 extract is similar to 0.7 pH units lower than that measured in a 1:5 soil suspension. Although the use of electrolytes can help stabilise pH measurements in low ionic strength soils, their use requires careful consideration, as they do not eliminate all seasonal variability (which may also be important to assess) and they can introduce large pH perturbations in sodic-alkaline and acid sulfate soils. Varying soil-to-solution ratios have less influence on resultant pH values than electrolytes however the measurements at low soil-to-solution ratios (e.g., 1:1 soil:water) are preferable for accuracy. Perturbations from field pH conditions due to CO2 outgassing and oxidation are likely when wet soils, acid sulfate soils and/or sub-soils are measured in the laboratory. These findings underscore the need for improved field measurement technology and further research on the measurement protocols to ensure accurate and reliable soil pH data, which are crucial for optimising agricultural practices and environmental management.",yes,"The abstract explicitly states the use of a 'comprehensive global soil dataset' to review and analyze soil pH, a critical parameter for agriculture.

Addressing this need must aim at not only reversing/recovering past degradation (e.g., via restoration or rehabilitation in land degradation hotspots), but also avoiding new degradation possibly caused by unsuitable LU and LM. This requires SLM planning based on anticipated impact assessment of the LU-LM transition scenarios set to achieve LDN, which can be achieved through a participatory planning process that integrates interests/needs and knowledge of stakeholders with science-based supportive tools to identify rational, plausible, and socially relevant options. The geoinformatics Land Use Planning for LDN (LUP4LDN) conceptual procedure and tool have been designed for this purpose. Their aim is to support national and subnational planners by (i) mapping geographic patterns of past land degradation (LD) utilizing the LDN indicators adopted by the UNCCD (SDG 15.3.1 indicator) for user-defined regions of interest (RoI); (ii) helping users anticipate future LD by identifying land that is unsustainably managed and that will likely become degraded during the planning period; (iii) partitioning the LD areas into spatial domains of socio-ecological contextual similarity (i.e., contextual similarity units) to which the LU-LM transitional options will be fitted; and (iv) providing an interactive procedure for participatory LU-LM transitional scenario development over selected contextual similarity units and timeframes.

Understanding N-P nutrient limitations patterns is crucial for comprehending variations in productivity within terrestrial ecosystems. However, the global nutrient limitation patterns of woody plants, that dominate forests, especially across different functional types, remain unclear. Here, we compiled a global dataset of leaf N and P concentrations and resorption efficiency (NRE and PRE) to explore latitudinal nutrient limitation patterns in natural woody plants and their environmental drivers. Based on published fertilization experiments, we compiled another global woody plant nutrient database to validate such identified patterns. The results showed that with increasing latitude, the relative P vs N resorption efficiency (PRE minus NRE) and the N and P ratio decreased in woody plant leaves, suggesting that the nutrient status of woody plants shifts from P to N limitation as latitude increases, with a switching point of N-P balance occurring at mid -latitudes (42.9 degrees -43.6 degrees). Different functional types exhibited similar trends, but with different switching latitudes of N vs P limitation. Due to the lower N uptake capacity of broadleaves than conifers, broadleaves reached N-P balance at lower latitudes (39.6 degrees -43.3 degrees) than conifers (57.1 degrees -59.1 degrees) in both hemispheres. Data from fertilization experiments successfully identified 81 % of the N limitation cases and 91 % of the P limitation cases identified using the first database. N and P limitation cases for conifers and broadleaves were also well identified separately. The latitudinal nutrient limitations in global woody plants are primarily shaped by climate and soil. Our study demonstrates the switching latitudes of N vs P limitation which varies between broadleaves and conifers. These findings enhance our understanding of plant nutrient dynamics in global climate change and aid in refining forest management.",yes,"The abstract describes the compilation and use of two global datasets related to plant nutrients, which falls within the scope of agriculture and related fields.",

Hydrological modeling can help to achieve this goal by evaluating water availability for different uses, including food production. Fully distributed hydrological models using digital maps of soil properties available for the soil profile are useful for mapping soil-water balance responses, namely water content and water stress. The accuracy of these model responses depends on the quality of the input data, namely, soil hydraulic properties (SHP). Nowadays, we have free access to worldwide digital 1D SHP grids created using global soil datasets, so detailed studies are now needed to evaluate their use in hydrological modeling. We compared the use of a global and a local SHP dataset to simulate soil-water balance at the regional scale in a small irrigation district located in southern Portugal. We explicitly characterized where differences in model responses occur and related those to the variability of soil physical and hydraulic properties, and land use. Our results showed that the choice of the SHP dataset matters. The statistical and spatial variability of simulated water content and water stress for different land uses depended on the dataset used for the numerical simulation. With the global dataset, water content was higher and water stress lower, and both had less statistical and spatial variability compared to the local dataset results. A practical consequence of these findings is misadjusted irrigation schedules, which can be detrimental to crop production and soil quality. A water management plan based on the global results will determine less water requirements, which may not be realistic for the Mediterranean conditions that characterize the study area.",yes,The abstract discusses the use of freely accessible worldwide digital soil property grids derived from global soil datasets for a hydrological modeling study.,

The articles were identified for inclusion in the dataset using the Web of Science Core Collection database, using various combinations of search terms related to methane, dairy, cattle, rumen, ruminant, energy balance, energy metabolism, energy partitioning, and enteric emissions. For inclusion in the dataset, studies had to be written in English and provide information on enteric methane emission, as well as report feed dry matter in-take along with measures of variance. Both continuous and crossover design studies were included, resulting in a comprehensive dataset with 797 records (rows) and 162 variables (columns). The variables cover various aspects such as publication information, experimental design, animal description, methane measurement method, and diet nutrient composition. Additionally, when available, the dataset includes treatment means and measures of variance for feed dry matter intake, rumen fermentation parameters, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen excretion, milk yield, milk components, as well as enteric methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen emissions.

However, this region is also subjected to some of the most intense land degradation processes, related to large scale land use change and climate change.To combat land degradation and pursue sustainable land management the concept of land degradation neutrality (LDN) has been proposed. LDN assessments are recommended to be based on global data in regions that lack sufficient regional data such as Central Asia. However, it remains unclear how the selection of datasets influences the estimated extent of land degradation. We followed the LDN framework and first calculated changes to three LDN indicators: land productivity, land cover, and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC). We then evaluated the impact of using different regional and global land cover data on the extent of land degradation in the region. Finally, we calculated a regionally specific integrated indicator on soil quality that we used to assess the like-for-like principle which enables counterbalancing losses and gains. Our results indicate that particularly the selection of land cover data has a significant impact on the overall assessment of degradation state. The extent of land between 2000 and 2019 varies considerably depending on the data and ranges between 15 and 34 % of the whole Central Asian region.Our findings reveal that the area of degraded land on high quality soils is twice as high as the area of high quality soils where the land condition has improved (12 % versus 6 %). In areas with low soil quality, 13 % was subject to degradation, and 10 % improved.Whilst the degradation extent varies according to the selected land cover datasets, our results demonstrates that Central Asia is undergoing land degradation affecting high quality soils.

Flood hazards are a constant threat to local communities and infrastructures (e.g., built-up environment and agricultural areas) in Nepal. Due to its negative consequences on societies and economic aspects, it is critical to monitor and map those risks. This study presents the open access earth observation (EO) data, geospatial products, and different analytical models available for flood risk assessment (FRA) and monitoring in Nepal. The status of flood risk knowledge and open-source data was reviewed through a systematic literature review. Multispectral optical data are widely used, but use of microwave data is extremely low. With the recent developments in this field, especially optical and microwave data, the monitoring, mapping, and modeling of flood hazards and risk have been more rapid and precise and are published in several scientific articles. This study shows that the choice of appropriate measurements and data for a flood risk assessment and management involves an understanding of the flood risk mechanism, flood plain dynamics, and primary parameter that should be addressed in order to minimize the risk. At the catchments, floodplains, and basin level, a variety of open data sources and models may be used under different socioeconomic and environmental limitations. If combined and analyzed further, multi-source data from different models and platforms could produce a new result to better understand the risks and mitigation measures related to various disasters.

However, current assessments of wetland C balance mainly focus on vertical fluxes between the land and atmosphere, frequently neglecting lateral carbon fluxes and land-use effects. Here, we conduct a global synthesis of 893 annual net ecosystem C balance (NECB) measures that include net ecosystem exchange of CO2, along with C input via manure fertilization, and C removal through biomass harvest or hydrological exports of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, across wetlands of different status and land uses. We find that elevating water table substantially reduces net ecosystem C losses, with the annual NECB decreasing from 2579 (95% interval: 1976 to 3214) kg C ha-1 year-1 in drained wetlands to -422 (-658 to -176) kg C ha-1 year-1 in natural wetlands, and to -934 (-1532 to -399) kg C ha-1 year-1 in rewetted wetlands globally. Climate, land-use history, and time since water table changes introduce variabilities, with drainage for (sub)tropical agriculture or forestry uses showing high annual C losses, while the net C losses from drained wetlands can continue to affect soil C pools for several decades. Rewetting all types of drained wetlands is needed, particularly for those formerly agriculture-used (sub)tropical wetlands where net ecosystem C losses can be largely reduced.

While excessive ROS cause oxidative stresses in cells, they act as signaling molecules when maintained at an optimum concentration through the dynamic equilibrium of ROS metabolizing mechanisms to regulate growth, development and response to environmental stress. Auxin and its crosstalk with other signaling cascades are crucial for maintaining ROS homeostasis and orchestrating root architecture but dissecting the underlying mechanism requires detailed investigation at the molecular level. Rice fibrous root system is primarily composed of shoot-derived adventitious roots (also called crown roots). Here, we uncover auxin-ROS cross-talk during initiation and growth of rice roots. Potassium iodide treatment changes ROS levels that results in an altered rice root architecture. We reveal that auxin induction recover root growth and development defects by recouping level of hydrogen peroxide.

The samples were further measured using traditional wet chemistry methods to build the prediction models for seventeen major parameters. The prediction models applied by AgroCares, the company that assisted in this study, combine spectral information from MIR and XRF into a single 'fused-spectrum'.

Historical pasture data are essential components of these spatially explicit global datasets, and their uncertainties have not been well evaluated.

We found that only the Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE) dataset can roughly reflect the temporal and spatial characteristics of historical pasture changes on the TP. The History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) version 3.2 and the Pongratz Julia (PJ) datasets overestimated pasture area for the TP dramatically, with a maximum area ratio of about 221% and 291%, respectively, and the Kaplan and Krumhardt 2010 (KK10) dataset underestimated pasture area for the TP dramatically, with a minimum area ratio of only 9%. As for the spatial pattern, all these global datasets overestimated the spatial scope of grazing activities obviously. The KK10 dataset unreasonably allocated pasture to forest areas in southeastern Tibet because only climate and soil factors were considered in assessing land suitability for grazing. Using population to estimate pasture area and only using natural factors to allocate pasture area into grids is unsuitable for the TP historical pasture reconstruction.

An earlier comparison of several soil successional series showed that pH explained variation in the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic processes in bacterial communities. In neutral pH soils, bacterial communities were more strongly influenced by stochastic processes than in low or high pH soils. Here, we took a broad level approach to attempt a more definitive answer of whether soil pH dominates bacterial community structuring using the global database of 237 samples. The beta-NTI showed that at both a global and continental scale, samples with low pH were dominated by deterministic processes, while in samples at around neutral pH, stochastic processes dominated. At high pH, stochasticity dominated on the global scale, but on several continents, the beta-NTI showed determinism predominating. Overall, it appears that bacterial community structuring is strongly and predictably affected by pH, with the most consistent difference observed between determinism at low pH and stochasticity at neutral pH. There is a need for hypothesis testing to explain why this trend exists. It is possible that at low pH, there is a greater selection for consortia to exploit resources, which leads to more predictable, deterministic combinations of species co-occurring. Additionally, the high energy demands for homeostasis and the constraints from the lack of available nutrient resources may impose greater niche-based competition, resulting in more deterministic community structuring at low pH.",yes,"The study uses a global database of soil samples to investigate bacterial community structuring, meeting all inclusion criteria.",

Among different tasks, the classification of weeds is a prerequisite for smart farming, and various techniques have been proposed to automatically detect weeds from images. However, many studies deal with weed images collected in the laboratory settings, and this might not be applicable to real-world scenarios. In this sense, there is still the need for robust classification systems that can be deployed in the field. In this work, we propose a practical solution to recognition of weeds exploiting two versions of EfficientNet as the recommendation engine. More importantly, to make the learning more effective, we also utilize different transfer learning strategies. The final aim is to build an expert system capable of accurately detecting weeds from lively captured images. We evaluate the approach's performance using DeepWeeds, a real-world dataset with 17,509 images.

Drip irrigation plays an important role in improving water and fertilization utilization efficiency and ensuring crop production in arid areas. Accurate prediction of soil salinity and crop evapotranspiration under drip irrigation is essential to guide water management practices in arid and saline areas. However, traditional hydrological models such as Hydrus require more variety of input parameters and user expertise, which limits its application in practice, and machine learning (ML) provides a potential alternative. Based on a global dataset collected from 134 pieces of literature, we proposed a method to comprehensively simulate soil salinity, evapotranspiration (ET) and cotton yield. Results showed that it was recommended to predict soil salinity, crop evapotranspiration and cotton yield based on soil data (bulk density), meteorological factors, irrigation data and other data. Among them, meteorological factors include annual average temperature, total precipitation, year. Irrigation data include salinity in irrigation water, soil matric potential and irrigation water volume, while other data include soil depth, distance from dripper, days after sowing (for EC and soil salinity), fertilization rate (for yield and ET). The accuracy of the model has reached a satisfactory level, R-2 in 0.78-0.99. The performance of stacking ensemble ML was better than that of a single model, i.e., gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT); random forest (RF); extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR), with R-2 increased by 0.02%-19.31%. In all input combinations, other data have a greater impact on the model accuracy, while the RMSE of the S1 scenario (input without meteorological factors) without meteorological data has little difference, which is -34.22%similar to 19.20% higher than that of full input. Given the wide application of drip irrigation in cotton, we recommend the application of ensemble ML to predict soil salinity and crop evapotranspiration, thus serving as the basis for adjusting the irrigation schedule.",yes,The study is based on a global dataset compiled from 134 literature sources to model soil salinity and cotton yield.,

Despite mounting petitions for regulatory approval, there lack a scientifically sound and powerful statistical method for establishing equivalence. The current paper develops and validates two procedures for testing a recently identified class of equivalence uniquely suited to crop safety. One procedure employs the modified large sample (MLS) method; the other is based on generalized pivotal quantities (GPQs). Because both methods were originally created under balanced designs, common issues associated with incomplete and unbalanced field designs were addressed by first identifying unfulfilled theoretical assumptions and then replacing them with user-friendly approximations. Simulation indicated that the MLS procedure could be very conservative in many occasions irrespective of the balance of the design; the GPQ procedure was mildly liberal with its type I error rate near the nominal level when the design is balanced. Additional pros and cons of these two procedures are also discussed.

Therefore, we propose a framework which can towards robust classification of multi-view remote sensing images with partial data availability. First, we construct a student model and teacher model mutual learning framework. In particular, we promote the consistency of student model and teacher model which enhances robustness under missing view and further improves performance under complete views.

This descriptive study brings together data from four open-access global databases on food supply, political, economic, and demographic variables, and nutrition and health between 1990 and 2017 to study potential leverage points for improvement in the food system. It compares trends in food supply and nutritional outcomes in The Gambia against regional and global averages, and identifies potential drivers taken from a food systems framework. The data show that, over the past three decades, total energy supply has increased, and obesity is rising quickly, but iron deficiency persists in a proportion of the population. Overall diet composition is poor, with lower availability of fruit and vegetables and higher supply of sugar and oils compared to regional and global averages. Domestic production is low for most food groups and so a high dependence on imports from other countries bridges the gap in terms of energy supply. Measures of economic development, particularly GDP, were positively related with supply of cereals and animal source foods over time, but no such relationship was observed with fruit and vegetable supply. Food system policy to improve nutrition and health outcomes in The Gambia needs to focus on improving the diversity of food supply - especially fruit and vegetables -and maxi-mizing national domestic production to reduce reliance on food imports.

Describing genetic programs that specifically regulate morphological traits can be complicated by genotypic differences in physiological traits. We describe the growth trajectories of leaves using novel Bayesian function-valued trait (FVT) modeling approaches in Brassica rapa recombinant inbred lines raised in heterogeneous field settings. While frequentist approaches estimate parameter values by treating each experimental replicate discretely, Bayesian models can utilize information in the global dataset, potentially leading to more robust trait estimation. We illustrate this principle by estimating growth asymptotes in the face of missing data and comparing heritabilities of growth trajectory parameters estimated by Bayesian and frequentist approaches. Using pseudo-Bayes factors, we compare the performance of an initial Bayesian logistic growth model and a model that incorporates carbon assimilation (A(max)) as a cofactor, thus statistically accounting for genotypic differences in carbon resources. We further evaluate two remotely sensed spectroradiometric indices, photochemical reflectance (pri2) and MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (mtci) as covariates in lieu of A(max), because these two indices were genetically correlated with A(max) across years and treatments yet allow much higher throughput compared to direct leaf-level gas-exchange measurements. For leaf lengths in uncrowded settings, including A(max) improves model fit over the initial model. The mtci and pri2 indices also outperform direct A(max) measurements.

Here, we combined global databases documenting the occurrence of non-native species and residence of non-native birds, mammals, and vascular plants at regional and local scales to describe how the likelihood of non-native occurrence and their proportion in local assemblages relate with their residence time and levels of human usage in different ecosystems. Our findings reveal that local non-native occurrence generally increases with residence time. Colonization is most rapid in croplands and urban areas, while it is slower and variable in natural or semi-natural ecosystems. Notably, non-native occurrence continues to rise even 200 years after introduction, especially for birds and vascular plants, and in other land-use types rather than croplands and urban areas. The impact of residence time on non-native proportions is significant only for mammals. We conclude that the continental exchange of biotas requires considerable time for effects to manifest at the local scale across taxa and land-use types. The unpredictability of future impacts, implied by the slow spread of non-native species, strengthens the call for stronger regulations on the exchange of non-native species to reduce the long-lasting invasion debt looming on ecosystems' future.The time non-native species need to colonize the local assemblages suitable to them after being introduced to a region is important for assessing ecological impacts, but has rarely been comprehensively analyzed so far. Here, we show that this colonization process needs more than a century to become fully realized in non-native birds, mammals, and even longer in vascular plants, with assemblages in primary vegetation colonized particularly slowly.

Therefore, it is essential to examine bioclimatic factors that affect forage growth in grasslands.Objective: To identify bioclimatic factors associated with forage growth and coverage in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.Methods: We examined how forage growth and coverage are affected by 35 bioclimatic indicators published in a global database (CMCC-BioClimInd).Results and conclusions: We comprehensively considered the relationship between 35 indicators and forage yield and coverage and found that the combination of temperature and precipitation indicators had a very high correlation with yield and coverage. When we evaluated the relationship between each index and forage yield, forage yield was found to be significantly correlated with 16 bioclimatic indices. Forage yield was positively correlated with yearly positive precipitation (R-2 = 0.49, p < 0.05), annual precipitation (R-2 = 0.48, p < 0.05), and precipitation of driest quarter (R-2 = 0.47, p < 0.05), and negatively correlated with temperature seasonality (R-2 = 0.52, p < 0.05), precipitation seasonality (R-2 = 0.39, p < 0.05), and simplified continentality index (R-2 = 0.48). Forage coverage was significantly correlated with 15 bioclimatic indicators. It showed positive correlations with precipitation of driest quarter (R-2 = 0.36, p < 0.05), precipitation of driest month (R-2 = 0.33, p < 0.05), and annual precipitation (R-2 = 0.31, p < 0.05), and negative correlations with temperature seasonality (R-2 = 0.415, p < 0.05), annual temperature range, precipitation seasonality, and simplified continentality index (R-2 = 0.37, p < 0.05).Significance: We identified bioclimatic indicators that affect forage growth in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and explored the physiological and ecological mechanisms underlying forage growth. Our results provide a scientific basis for future forage management, early determination of livestock carrying capacity, rational management of animal husbandry practices, and ecological protection and restoration efforts.",no,"The study's analysis is focused on a specific region (Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau), which violates the exclusion criterion of not being local/regional/national only.",

In view of the global decline in crop production, as a result of increasing threats (such as habitat fragmentation and land use change) to pollinators, knowledge concerning legume floral visitors can contribute to world food security. In this study, a synthesis was performed of global data on interactions between legume crops and their floral visitors, in order to improve understanding of the structure of crop-floral visitor interactions and the roles of different species. A literature review was conducted using three databases, considering 15 legumes of economic importance, enabling the construction of a meta-network of plant-floral visitor interactions. Soybean, alfalfa and common bean received the highest numbers of floral visitor species. A total of 208 floral visitor species were recorded, distributed in eight orders. The most diverse group was Hymenoptera (mainly bees), followed by Lepidoptera. The European honeybee Apis mellifera interacted with the highest number of plant species. Modularity analysis identified eight modules that included more than one order of floral visitors. Most species were classified as peripherals, with few links restricted to their own module. The three connector species were the bees Bombus pascuorum, B. terrestris and Megachile rotundata. The only network hub was A. mellifera. The predominance of bees seemed to be related to the predominant floral morphology among the crops. The connector and hub species were typically generalists, and all except one species (B. pascuorum) were used as managed pollinators. The crops studied have an important role in global pollination resilience, maintaining a diversified fauna of pollinators other than bees.",yes,"The paper synthesizes global data from multiple databases to create a global meta-network of legume crop-pollinator interactions, meeting all inclusion criteria and avoiding all exclusion criteria.",

This method directly measures the amount of transpiration as the changes in the weight of the root-ball. In this paper, the suitability of a large root-ball of Michelia figo was investigated by observing the changes in sap flow and transpiration rate during and after transplantation and root pruning. The heat pulse velocity decreased by 33% compared to the previous value in response to root cutting and transplanting. However, there were no large differences in the annual maximum value of heat pulse velocity for three years. Three years after transplantation, the same tree was transplanted again with a large root-ball and the transpiration rate measured by weighing was almost equal to that of the first large root-ball. Furthermore, after downsizing the root-ball, the transpiration rate decreased by 45%. Especially, the inner heat pulse velocity clearly decreased after root cutting. The sap flux profile in the trunk may have changed in response to the reduction in root volume and the cutting of major roots. We found the clear relationship between actual transpiration rate and heat pulse velocity. Thus, the weighing root-ball method is suitable to calibrate the heat ratio method.",no,"The abstract describes a calibration method and a specific experiment, but does not mention the use or production of a dataset, database, or other data source.",

This study evaluates the factors influencing the proportion of plant nitrogen derived from atmospheric fixation (Ndfa) in legume crops. We compiled a global dataset spanning from 1980 to 2018 and used the 15N method to assess the impacts of crop species, climatic conditions, stand composition and nitrogen fertilisation on Ndfa. The global meta-analysis reveals that the percentage of nitrogen derived from atmospheric fixation (Ndfa) in legumes ranges from 5% to 99%, with an average of 68%. Fodder legumes exhibited higher Ndfa, averaging 75%, while grain legumes showed more variability, ranging from 38% to 85%, depending on species and climatic conditions. The significant variability in Ndfa underscores the complexity of the process, which is influenced by species-specific traits, ecological conditions and competition in mixed stands. However, the current data is insufficient for precise Ndfa estimation in nitrogen balances and decision support tools. The study highlights the need for further research on the impact of nitrogen fertilisation and stand composition on Ndfa. These findings emphasise the potential of BNF to support sustainable agriculture by improving nitrogen availability and reducing dependence on synthetic fertilisers and particularly susceptibility to climate change challenges. To optimise the benefits of BNF, future research should focus on refining fertilisation regimes and exploring species-specific responses to various ecological conditions.

The intensifying global burden of fish diseases threatens the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems and the aquaculture industry, necessitating sophisticated modelling strategies for effective disease management and control. The proposed approach capitalizes on the non-linear data modelling strength of ANNs, the explanatory power of SR, and the decision-making efficiency of DTs, offering both predictive accuracy and interpretable insights. The architecture of the proposed ensemble method is developed in two stages. In the intermediate stage, an ANN is employed to learn the complex, non-linear interactions between various biological and environmental factors impacting fish health. Additionally, SR is applied to produce a symbolic equation that effectively maps the input variables to fish mortality rates. In the final stage, a DT model is included to enhance prediction performance by capturing decision rules from the data. This hybrid approach offers superior prediction performance while also revealing meaningful biological/environmental relationships that can guide preventive and reactive interventions in the management of fish health. We evaluate the developed models using extensive real-world datasets acquired from two large Greek fish-farming units, which encompass representative disease types. The results demonstrate that our ensemble approach significantly outperforms traditional standalone models developed in our recent previous work, achieving enhanced predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

We discovered that changes in cultivar yield and maturity features, cropping location, and nitrogen fertilizer treatment may all affect a plant's capacity to tiller.

Generation of robust auxin response, followed by activation of downstream cell fate determinants and signaling pathways at the onset of crown root primordia (CRP) establishment is essential for new root initiation. During rice tissue culture, embryonic calli are induced to regenerate shoots in vitro which undergo de novo root organogenesis on an exogenous auxin-supplemented medium, but the mechanism underlying spatially restricted root organogenesis remains unknown. Here, we reveal the dynamics of progressive activation of genes involved in auxin homeostasis and signaling during initiation and outgrowth of rice crown root primordia. By comparative global dataset analysis, we identify the crown root primordia-expressed genes whose expression is also regulated by auxin signaling. In-depth spatio-temporal expression pattern analysis shows that the exogenous application of auxin induces a set of key transcription factors exclusively in the spatially positioned CRP. Further, functional analysis of rice WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 10 (OsWOX10) during in vitro plantlet regeneration from embryogenic calli shows that it promotes de novo root organogenesis from regenerated shoots. Expression of rice OsWOX10 also induces adventitious roots (AR) in Arabidopsis, independent of homologous endogenous Arabidopsis genes. Together, our findings reveal that a common auxin-transcription factor regulatory module is involved in root organogenesis under different conditions.",yes,"The abstract mentions the use of a global dataset for analysis in a study on rice, a key agricultural crop.

Currently, human specialists perform this quality control process through seed vigor analysis.It is not only a labor-intensive approach highly susceptible to failure, but also the analysts must understand seed anatomy. This paper proposes a learning-based expert approach and pipeline capable of automatically defining the seeds' vigor. Our proposed approach simplifies, in an intuitive manner, the entire process of the seed vigor analysis. To corroborate our learning-based approach, we applied it in a real environment to capture, process, and use two real-world datasets composed of hundreds of soybean images with different damages from a seed classification laboratory. From the experiments, we can testify to a strong efficacy and efficiency in these real-world cases, reaching up to 80.17%& PLUSMN;2.37 of accuracy.

Here we present a first global overview of their chemistry by considering 1,508 water bodies, with data from 485 peer-reviewed publications from 1868 to 2020 and further five online databases. This work focusses on major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-&CO32-, Cl-, SO42-) and investigates analogies as well as differences between lakes and reservoirs. We applied a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to group both types of water bodies and to find differences and similarities. The PCA identified fewer variabilities for major ions in reservoirs than in lakes. Moreover, our analyses showed that lakes generally have more total dissolved solids (TDS). Such higher TDS loads in lakes could result from more diverse (and less controlled) inputs from larger catchments and from longer lasting interactions with thicker internal sediment layers. Global median geochemical compositions identified both reservoirs and lakes as calcium-bicarbonate-type waters. This first synthesis provides a basis for future studies and may serve as the start of a global database on these important water bodies.",yes,"The paper compiles a global dataset on the chemistry of lakes and reservoirs, which are explicitly linked to agriculture.

Although cutting damage is used in most apple transformation operations, our study found that by using crush damage the regenerated calluses or plantlets on leaves almost all are homogeneous unlike chimera plantlets, only the plantlets regeneration rates are lower than when using cutting damage. No difference was found in transgenic plantlet regeneration rates when different types of plasmid vectors with the same antibiotic selection marker gene were used. The difference in plantlet regeneration rates was clear even on the same plasmid vector with different antibiotic selection marker genes. Fluorescence analysis showed that by using high antibiotic selection pressure (50 mg L-1) all the regenerated transgenic calluses had strong green fluorescence. While low selection pressure (10 mg L-1), besides the escape and chimera calluses, resulted in much more regenerated calluses where different degrees of fluorescence were observed. We think that plantlets from these calluses could be used in the expression study of apple transgenic plants. Gene silencing was tested on apple transgenic plantlets after one year continued observation by using fluorescence analysis. In the newly obtained transgenic plantlets, strong green fluorescence was observed. Meanwhile after one year of subculture, fluorescence of shoot tips and young leaves was lost on some transgenic plantlets, and calluses with strong green fluorescence could be induced on the leaves of those plantlets.",no,The abstract describes a specific laboratory experiment on apple genetic transformation and does not mention the use or creation of any dataset.,

We demonstrated that each of these traits exhibited remarkably large phylogenetic signals across all land plants. Based on the strength of this signal we then developed random forest (RF) models trained on TRY trait data to impute the traits of previously unstudied tree species using Phylogenetic Eigenvector Maps. We quantified imputed trait uncertainty by fitting RF model test dataset residuals to skew exponential power distributions accounting for heteroscedasticity, demonstrating encouraging lack of biases in the imputed dataset.

The identification of genetically linked factors impeding further progress in wheat grain yield improvement is therefore urgently required. Method: A comparative meta-analysis of data from 66 publicly available field experiments involving multiple wheat genotypes was performed to identify traits altered in breeding programs, their relationship with grain yield, and their past and current impact on grain yield increases. Results: Wheat grain yield can be increased by increasing either the aboveground biomass (ABM) or the harvest index (HI). However, there was no correlation between these traits since a reduction in plant height can occur with increases in the HI and overall grain yield, but with no reduction in the ABM. The combined data from 32 global datasets revealed a substantial increase in wheat grain yield from 1860 to 2017, accompanied by improvement in HI and yield components. When considering only the genotypes introduced from the 1960s to 2017, there was a linear increase observed in both grain yield and HI until the mid-1980s. However, genetic progress in HI and GY has slowed down since then. Before the mid-1980s, there was a decreasing trend observed in plant height which remained relatively static thereafter. While ABM did not exhibit significant increases during this period. After the mid-1980s, significant improvements have been observed in ABM; however, no obvious increase were observed in other yield components. Conclusions: Since the 1980s, there has been an increase in the aboveground biomass of wheat, while grain weigth and grains per m2 increases trending slowly, and both harvest index and grain yield have almost stagnated. Therefore, increasing grains per m2 and/or grain weight should be the major research direction to further improve the wheat harvest index and grain yield in the future. Implications: The systematic study of changes in wheat traits in past breeding efforts for improved grain yields has provided useful indicators for the direction of wheat breeding in the future.",yes,The abstract describes a meta-analysis using data from 66 publicly available field experiments and 32 global datasets on wheat.,

However, the temporal stability of the LES relationships is largely unknown. We used the wild blueberry system with high genotypic diversity to test whether trait-trait relationships across genotypes demonstrate the same LES relationships found in the global database (GLOPNET) and whether they are stable across years. We studied leaf structure, photosynthesis, and leaf nutrients for 16 genotypes of two wild blueberry species semi-naturally grown in a common farm in Maine, USA, across 4 yr. We found substantial variation in leaf structure, physiology, and nutrient traits within and among genotypes, as well as across years in wild blueberries. The LES trait-trait relationships (covariance structure) across genotypes were not always found in all years. The trait syndrome of wild blueberries was shifted by changing environmental conditions over the years. Additionally, traits in 1 yr cannot be used to predict those of another year. Our findings show that LES generally holds among genotypes but is temporally unstable, stressing the significant influence of trait plasticity in response to fluctuating environmental conditions across years, and the importance of temporal dimensions in shaping functional traits and species coexistence.",yes,The abstract mentions the use of the global database GLOPNET for comparison in a study on wild blueberries.,GLOPNET

All articles were identified for inclusion in the dataset using the Web of Science Core Collection, the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau International (CABI), and the EBSCO Discovery Service databases with the search terms methane and enteric in combination with beef, cattle, rumen, and ruminant. Additionally, the search term rumen was used in combination with energy balance, energy metabolism, or energy partitioning. For dataset inclusion, it was necessary for all studies to be written in English and at a minimum, quantify feed dry matter intake and enteric methane emissions as well as provide measures of variance for these estimates. Studies were primarily designed as completely randomized, randomized block, or crossover experiments. The dataset includes 895 records (rows) and 138 variables (columns). Reported variables include publication information, experimental design, animal description, methane measurement method, diet nutrient composition, and means and measures of variance for feed dry matter intake and enteric methane emissions. Additionally, depending on the study, data reported on rumen fermentation parameters, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen excretion, weight gain, and carbon dioxide and hydrogen emissions were included. This dataset can be used to explore the efficacy of enteric methane mitigation strategies and their impact on beef cattle nutrition and production.

K estimation methods have been developed in many soil erosion and water quality models, which are developed for soil data-rich areas and pose a challenge for areas with limited data. Unlike others, using the erosion productivity impact calculator (EPIC) model, the required soil parameters for calculating K can be extracted from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) world database. To verify the FAO soil database and develop an alternative K method (KET) by mimicking the equation of K used in the EPIC model, we collected 203 soil samples from different soil units in the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lake Basin (ERVLB). Unlike the K of EPIC model, KET is developed based on the physical properties of soils that can be easily measured in a laboratory. The results from KET were compared with those from the EPIC-K. Statistically, the performance of KET is excellent and the soil analysis result of ERVLB deviates from the FAO soil database on lower altitude areas of the basin. When KET is projected for the overall soil units of the country, it predicts 35.7% of the country's soil with less than +/- 5% relative error. On average, the KET can be applied to overall country soils with a relative error of - 9.88% with a standard deviation of 6.4. By applying KET, the ERVLB and the country K map were produced.

Here, we identify global priorities for A&M by evaluating global datasets on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate hazards related to agriculture. We show that joint A&M hotspots cover <23% of global agricultural emissions and include 52% of the areas with significant climate hazards. The major portion of the joint area is croplands (ranging from 213 to 364 Mha), followed by pastures (3-74 Mha), and is concentrated in countries with limited ability to investment in adaptation actions. The most substantial A&M hotspots are situated across South Asia, with smaller areas in South East Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We highlight three findings from this analysis. First, most emissions and climate hazards do not occur in the same agricultural areas, suggesting the need for different strategies to address adaptation and mitigation separately in these areas. Second, in the areas where emissions and climate hazards do overlap, coordinated climate interventions that address emission reductions and adaptation at the same time would be a more effective use of scarce climate action investments. Third, A&M hotspots span national borders, emphasizing the importance of setting priorities and implementing action at regional and international scales. While our analysis highlights that focusing on adaptation and mitigation actions in the agricultural landscapes where they are most needed could help make the best use of climate finance, we recognize the pragmatic and justice-related implications may limit the extent of such prioritization. Balancing these considerations is essential for effective climate finance allocation and equitable climate action outcomes.",yes,The abstract states the study evaluates global datasets on GHG emissions and climate hazards in agriculture to identify global priorities.,
