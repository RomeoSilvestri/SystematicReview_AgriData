Mayer; B. Ortuani; M. De Peppo; F. Nutini; A. Crema; M. Boschetti; G. Ragaglini; A. Facchi,2022,"In the most recent agricultural seasons water scarcity problems in many areas of the Po plain had become more frequent; thus, the introduction of irrigation-saving methods and technologies is becoming essential, especially in areas that cannot benefit from a large availability of surface water resources. In the context of precision irrigation, aimed at increasing water and energy productivity at the farm scale by operating a spatial and temporal variable-rate irrigation if needed, agro-hydrological models play a crucial role. In this study, remote-sensed phenometrics and biophysical crop parameters, and delineation of homogeneous management zones through an electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor, were used to parametrize a semi-distributed mechanistic agro-hydrological model in the case of a 300-ha maize farm located in Brescia (northern Italy). The modelling system was applied to simulate irrigation use in the current situation and in the case of an optimized and variable rate irrigation management. Average results for the period 2016–2020 showed a water and energy saving of about 20% in the case of the optimized irrigation management, confirmed by savings achieved in a pilot pivot in which the modelling procedure was used in 2021 to support the irrigation scheduling in combination with 7-days weather forecast data.",no,"The study is conducted on a single farm in northern Italy, which is local coverage, not the required national coverage.",

Léo,2015,"The confluence of rapidly growing streams of “free and open” satellite imagery at 10-30 m spatial resolution, expending libraries of sophisticated open source software components for geospatial data processing and the increase in publicly available open data sets is driving major changes in agricultural monitoring activities. In the next years, we can expect a scale step in derived crop area and status information at parcel level from the combined use of global sensors such as Landsat-8, Sentinel 1 and 2. In order to handle the unprecedented flow of such data into value adding agricultural mapping and monitoring applications, novel approaches need to be developed to ensure a globally consistent use in a “knowledge inference” context in support of, for instance, food security analysis.

Pampalone,2022,"The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is still widely used to predict soil loss by water erosion and to establish soil conservation measures. In this model, the soil erodibility factor $K$ accounts for the susceptibility of the soil to be eroded due to the detachment and transport processes operated by the erosive agents. According to the USLE scheme, the $K$ factor should be measured on unit plots, i.e., bare plots of given length (22 m) and steepness (9%) tilled along the maximum slope direction, but there is little evidence that there ever existed an actual unit plot between the plots used to develop the USLE. Given the difficulty in collecting sufficient data to adequately measure $K$., the nomograph method was early developed to allow estimation of $K$ based on standard soil properties. First, in this investigation the soil erodibility factor was experimentally determined for the clay soil of the Sparacia (Sicily) experimental station, based on the available measurements collected in two unit plots. Although a limited database was available for this analysis, a very low value (0.0038 t ha h ha−1 MJ−1 mm−1) was determined, which was an order of magnitude lower than the nomograph value. Then, the values of the plot steepness factor $S$ were determined using soil loss measurements collected on plots varying in steepness from 9 to 26% and resulted higher than the estimated values by a well-known literature expression. Finally, the plot length factor $L$ resulted independent of the plot length and equal to one. The former result was explained by the different flow transport capacity in the unit plot and plot with increased steepness, while the result of a constant length factor was supported by other experimental investigations.",no,"The data was collected at a specific experimental area in southern Italy, which constitutes local, not national, coverage.",

Briassouli,2021,"Detecting plants in images is central in precision agriculture, but can be challenging due to their small size, similarities in appearance, varying lighting and environmental conditions. Moreover, computational capacity in real-world settings may be limited. This work examines how accurate, computationally efficient real-time plant detection can be achieved on the large and varied benchmarking Open Plant Phenotyping Database, by building upon the State-of-the-Art (SoA) Scaled YOLO v4 real-time object detection model. The effect of pre-processing, namely cropping unnecessary information and increasing contrast, is examined and experimentally shown to improve both accuracy and efficiency. Transfer learning is also leveraged for the deployment of Scaled YOLO v4, using pre-trained weights from the MS COCO data set, and shown to lead to a moderate improvement in accuracy. The proposed final model results in approximately 10% higher accuracy than the existing baseline model, on a representative subset of about half of images in the Open Plant Phenotyping Database. Experiments show that plant detection accuracy is improved for most well represented samples, with errors appearing in particularly challenging cases or caused by data imbalance.

These technologies enable farmers to monitor crop conditions, soil moisture, and equipment performance in real-time, leading to more efficient practices. However, challenges such as missing data due to low network connectivity in farming areas and inefficiencies due to resource overuse during field operations still persist. This paper addresses these critical issues by presenting and implementing a comprehensive data collection mechanism using IoT architecture and sensors installed on farm machinery, capturing key metrics in real-time using serverless cloud technology. This data helps optimize field coverage and minimize redundant work. We further address the issue of missing data incorporating artificial intelligence-based Bidirectional Recurrent Imputation for Time Series (BRITS) model.

D'Amato; P. Bartkowiak; S. Azimi; M. Castelli; R. Rigon; C. Massari,2022,"Remote sensing measurements offer great potential to quantify evapotranspiration (ET) more accurately. This work assesses several remotely-sensed ET datasets at high, medium and coarse scale through a comparison with eddy covariance (EC) measurements. In particular, daily retrievals obtained from the Sen-ET model and the ECOSTRESS ET product, both having resolutions of tens of meters, were considered. In addition, 3-km daily ET estimates derived from SEVIRI were analyzed, together with 8-day MODIS ET composites at 500-m spatial resolution. The remotely-sensed actual ET retrievals at medium and coarse scale were compared with EC observations at five forest and grassland sites over different climate zones in Italy. Additionally, for one of these sites (Monte Bondone), the high-resolution ET estimates within the EC footprint were also evaluated. Sen-ET retrievals demonstrated a remarkable ability to describe EC latent heat fluxes (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient, R, equal to 0.83, and unbiased root-mean-square-difference, ubRMSD, equal to 0.85 mm/day), and therefore great potential for producing high-resolution ET estimates, while ECOSTRESS data were less performant (e.g., R = 0.46, and $\boldsymbol{ubRMSD}=1.65\boldsymbol{mm}/\text{day})$. Despite the spatial differences between EC footprint size and the medium along with coarse scale of remotely-sensed datasets, the latter both showed a good agreement with the measured EC fluxes. The SEVIRI ET, in particular, proved to be significantly suitable for the ET description also at a local scale (at daily time step, average R = 0.84, and average $\boldsymbol{u b R M S D=\mathbf0. 8 3}$ mm/day over the study sites), despite a tendency to underestimate in-situ measurements (negative biases ranging between 0.2 and 0.85 mm/day were observed).

Sun,2020,"In order to better realize agricultural informatization, a data management system for agricultural supply chain, which has the characteristics of safe, credible, stable, traceable, information-sharing, and large-throughput, is needed to construct. To date, the information management method for China's agricultural supply chain is usually stored in a centralized database and file system, with weak information management capabilities, leading to problems such as theft, tampering, deletion, and inconsistencies. In light of these problems, we introduce blockchain technology which is a cutting-edge technology in digital finance and has developed rapidly. This paper proposes a data management system based on blockchain technology and affords efficient data extraction, management and access control for heterogeneous forms of data across the agricultural supply chain. The data management system includes four credible data management platforms: agricultural production information, recording transportation information, farmer-consumer transaction information, and consumer credit information. It also can add more platforms according to later needs and combine an interstellar distributed file system and smart contract technology, making it possible to conduct information security research throughout the agricultural supply chain. The proposed system effectively protects information about supply chain activities including agricultural product production, warehousing, transportation, distribution, and sales.

Joshi,2023,"Big Data empowers the farming community with the information needed to optimize resource usage, increase productivity, and enhance the sustainability of agricultural practices. The use of Big Data in farming requires the collection and analysis of data from various sources such as sensors, satellites, and farmer surveys. While Big Data can provide the farming community with valuable insights and improve efficiency, there is significant concern regarding the security of this data as well as the privacy of the participants. Privacy regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU Code of Conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement, and the proposed EU AI law, have been created to address the issue of data privacy and provide specific guidelines on when and how data can be shared between organizations. To make confidential agricultural data widely available for Big Data analysis without violating the privacy of the data subjects, we consider privacy-preserving methods of data sharing in agriculture. Synthetic data that retains the statistical properties of the original data but does not include actual individuals’ information provides a suitable alternative to sharing sensitive datasets. Deep learning-based synthetic data generation has been proposed for privacy-preserving data sharing. However, there is a lack of compliance with documented data privacy policies in such privacy-preserving efforts. In this study, we propose a novel framework for enforcing privacy policy rules in privacy-preserving data generation algorithms. We explore several available agricultural codes of conduct, extract knowledge related to the privacy constraints in data, and use the extracted knowledge to define privacy bounds in a privacy-preserving generative model. We use our framework to generate synthetic agricultural data and present experimental results that demonstrate the utility of the synthetic dataset in downstream tasks.

Rizza; A. Rocci; C. Grignani; L. Zavattaro; B. Moretti; M. Fantappié; S.

Moreover, this issue is of great importance in the development of monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems as part of climate change mitigation measures affecting the agricultural sector. In this context, the present study aims to investigate the reliability of visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy as a fast method to determine and monitor the SOC content in an MRV system framework. To that aim, soils from a Long-term field experiment (LTE), located in northern Italy and comparing various maize-based forage systems with contrasting residues and fertilization management was used as a case study. Three sampling campaigns (i.e. 2003, 2012, and 2018) were utilized for a total of 162 soil samples collected in the LTE (54 each). Soil samples archived after each campaign were retrieved and scanned using a Vis-NIR spectrometer to create a site-specific soil spectral library (Site-SSL). Aiming to implement a local prediction model, the 54 soil samples and spectra collected in 2003 were used as a training data set to estimate the SOC of the soil samples collected in 2012 and 2018 (108 in total). In practice, 2003 soil survey represented the time zero reference system. Concurrently, a second prediction model was performed from a regional soil sample archive (Reg-SSL). This is a dataset containing 122 soil samples and spectra collected in alluvial soils from the Po Plain, in the same pedo-landscape of the LTE. The Reg-SSL was merged with the 2003 Site-SSL to implement a regional prediction model. The objective of this activity was to compare the SOC estimations for 2012 and 2018 obtained with both Site-SSL and Reg-SSL models. In addition, three strategies were compared, including Random Forest (RF), Cubist (CU), and Memory based learning (MBL) on Site-SSL and Reg-SSL models (totally, six models were created). We also carried out a sensitivity analysis about the influence of training sample size on the accuracy of different models. Results revealed high correlations between measured and predicted values and for this kind of application, the best results were identified for the MBL model and the Site-SSL dataset. This exercise pointed out that Vis-NIR spectral libraries could be used for detecting changes in SOC. In addition, comparing the use of regional and site-specific libraries for SOC estimation, we confirmed that the accuracy of the Reg-SSL model, although more stable, was lower than that of Site-SSL.

In this study, an attempt has been made to analyze land use/land cover changes (LULCC) in Italy between the years 2000 and 2018 using Copernicus CORINE Land Cover (CLC) datasets of corresponding years. In addition, the Cellular Automata Markov model has been employed to predict the LULC of Italy for the year 2050. The CLC datasets were reclassified into 8 major land cover/use classes: built-up, agriculture, forests, natural vegetation, bare land, water bodies, ice/snow, and wet-land. Resultant LULCC detection maps indicate a significant increase in bare land by 36.4 % in the period 2000–2018 and, according to the prediction, a further increase by 46.7 % in the period 2018–2050 will be experienced. Built-up increased by 14.7 % between 2000–2018 and 19.8 % between 2018–2050. Significant decreases in natural vegetation and ice/snow in the period 2000–2018 have been quantified in 18.9 % and 6.5 %, respectively.

Procedures adopted for Green Buildings are often based on both the reduction of environmental impact of buildings and the improvement of human and animal wellness. This study stems from the need to reuse agricultural wastes (AW) for producing sustainable materials to be used for the construction or renovation of rural buildings. Since a sustainable reuse of AW depends on their availability and geographical location, a methodology was put forward to locate and quantify the wastes considered in this research study i.e., plastic films used for protected crops and sheep wool. By using a Geographical Information System (GIS), land use analysis was carried out in an area with the highest concentration of protected crops in Italy (Ragusa province). A suitable index for computing Agricultural Plastic Wastes (APW) was chosen from literature. Furthermore, by using data supplied by National Zootechnical Registry, a dedicated GIS model was developed to localize and quantify sheep and breeder’s sheep in Sicily.

Spectroscopic measurements for these soil and water samples were collected under stable laboratory conditions using two instruments to cover the full range of wavelength: Ocean Insight HR2000+ (400 to 950nm) and ARCoptix (900 to 2600nm). The objective of this study is to use these spectral reflectance measurements to develop models that can predict both SOC and DOC.

In IoT systems, if data management is entirely performed in the cloud, the system may not work correctly due to connectivity problems, which is common in some remote regions where the agribusiness thrives. A fog computing solution enables the IoT system to process data faster and deal with intermittent connectivity. However, a high number of packets sent from the fog to the cloud can cause link congestion with mostly useless data traffic. Dealing with fog data filtering is a challenge because it requires knowing which data is essential to send to the cloud. This paper proposes an approach to collect and store data in a smart agriculture environment and two different methods filtering data in the fog. We designed an experiment for each filtering method, using a real dataset containing temperature and humidity values. In both experiments, the fog filters the data using the k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) algorithm, which classifies data into categories according to their value ranges. In the first experiment, the fog classifies the data and generates an output of the number of data categories. In the second experiment, data is classified and also compressed based on the previously obtained categories using the runlength encoding (RLE) technique to preserve the data time series nature.

Increasing world population and climate change are setting new challenges to food production. Water stress can cause severe damage to crops, and detecting and preventing this threat is crucial. Smart agriculture and the use of sensors directly on the field is a promising and rapidly evolving solution. Data collected by a large number of sensors must be analyzed and efficiently interpreted. In this context, machine learning is an effective solution. This article conducts a comparative analysis of several well-established machine learning models, all trained on a dataset enriched with a novel parameter for the assessment of plant health, the stem electrical impedance (modulus and phase). This feature gives promising results since it is a direct parameter of the plant itself. Moreover, the inclusion of the stem impedance parameter significantly boosted the model's performance, notably enhancing the effectiveness, particularly evident in the case of the top-performing model in this study, the random forest algorithm. When incorporating stem electrical impedance, this model achieved an impressive F1 score of 98%, markedly surpassing the 88% obtained in its absence. As a complementary analysis, a permutation feature performance analysis was conducted, highlighting the potential of stem impedance modulus as a promising feature for evaluating plant watering conditions. The removal of impedance modulus from the training model resulted in an average classification performance loss of 25% in terms of F1 score, suggesting how impedance monitoring is a promising approach for plant health management.",no,"The abstract does not specify the geographic origin of the dataset used for training the machine learning models, failing the Italian coverage criterion.",

Maria De Girolamo; F. Gentile,2022,"Sediment load quantification is an important task in river basin management, as it provides the order of magnitude of soil loss. Yearly sediment loads were quantified in two river basins of the Apulia region, the Carapelle (506 km2) and the Celone river basin (72 km2), For the Carapelle river basin, streamflow and suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) were monitored from 2007 to 2011 with an infrared optical probe and suspended sediment load at the yearly basis was quantified by integration of instantaneous flux. For the Celone river, continuous measurements of streamflow and discrete measurements of SSC taken, from 2010 to 2011, in all hydrological conditions (high, normal and low flow) were used to develop sediment rating curves. In particular, different sediment rating curves were developed for the entire dataset and three subsets of data identified based on the hydrological conditions and loads were computed with and without a back-transformation correction factor. At the Celone river gauge, annual specific sediment load ranged from 2.4 t ha−1 yr−1to 6.06 t ha−1 yr−1. At the Carapelle river gauge, the annual specific sediment load ranged from 0.9 t ha−1yr−1to 7.45 t ha−1 yr−1.

Based on field data, three NDVI value classes that indicated the vegetation density could then be identified: high (NDVI > 0.5.), medium (NDVI 0.3-0.5), and low (NDVI <; 0.3). These NDVI classes were used in a supervised Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) of the respective images.

Moreover, the CCC and LAI automatic products obtained directly through the Sentinel Application Platform Software (SNAP) biophysical processor and Sentine1-2 images by means of an artificial neural network (ANN) are validated. On the other hand, common vegetation indices used to LAI and CCC retrieval are analyzed. Both methods were tested using a dataset composed of LAI and CCC in situ data, obtained in an agricultural area near Caserta (Italy). As a result, Sentine1-2 automatic products present good statistics for LAI $(\mathrm{R}^{2}=0.86$, RMSE $=0.80$) and CCC ($\mathrm{R}^{2}=0.85$, RMSE $=0.68\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$), without producing saturation at high LAI values. On the other hand, the best index for LAI retrieval was the normalized SeLI index $(\mathrm{R}^{2} = 0.81$, RMSE $= 0.87$) and for CCC, the three-band TCARI index ($\mathrm{R}^{2} = 0.81$, RMSE $= 0.61 \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$). But the SeLI index produces a saturation process with LAI values higher than 3.5. The main conclusion of this study, hence, is that Sentine1-2 Level 2A products, such as the LAI and CCC parameter, have great potential to be used automatically and operationally in agricultural studies, minimizing time and economic costs.",no,"The dataset has regional coverage (Caserta, Italy), which is an exclusion criterion.",

Indeed, a greenhouse inner micro-climate, which is the result of an extensive set of inter-related environmental variables influenced by external weather conditions, has to be tightly monitored, regulated, and, some-times, forecast. Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Machine Learning (ML) are two of the most successful technologies to deal with this challenge. In this paper, we discuss how a Smart Gateway (GW), acting as a collector for sensor data coming from a WSN installed in a greenhouse, could be enriched with a Neural Network (NN)-based prediction model allowing to forecast a greenhouse's inner air temperature. In the case of missing sensor data coming from the WSN, the proposed prediction algorithm, fed with meteorological open data (gathered from the DarkSky repository), is run on the GW in order to predict the missing values. Despite the model is especially designed to be lightweight and executable by a device with constrained capabilities, it can be adopted either at Cloud or at GW level to forecast future air temperature's values, in order to support the management of a greenhouse.

Traditionally, most methods for yield forecasting are based on historical data and yield estimates from manually collected samples. More modern approaches often rely on computer vision-based fruit counting algorithms, which do not take individual crop weights into account.In this paper, we propose a novel, non-destructive method to estimate the mass of individual pieces of fruit by exploiting the dynamic properties of plants. By observing short-term oscillatory plant motion through RGB-D video data, we formulate an approach for mass estimation based on determining the parameters of a damped harmonic oscillator model.We test the proposed algorithm by collecting a dataset of around 300 video samples of strawberries on a real strawberry farm and apply our method. With a semi-automated toolchain, capable of inferring the key parameters from video data and calculating the mass of individual berries from those, we were able to estimate the mass of all berries in our dataset with a median error of 1.16g, outperforming a baseline utilising vision-based volume estimation to infer the mass.

To overcome these limitations, state-of-the-art supervised deep learning algorithms have been recently employed. However, the annotations of individual leaf instances is time consuming, in addition the variability in leaf shapes and its arrangement among different plant species limits the broad utilisation of these algorithms. To relieve this bottleneck, we propose a novel framework that relies on a graph based formulation to extract leaf shape knowledge for the task of leaf instance segmentation.

In this paper, we investigate Trojan attacks against neural networks. For a Trojan attack, we consider the DroNet architecture. DroNet is a convolutional neural network capable of safely driving a UAV across city streets. DroNet navigates UAVs by predicting steering angles and collision probabilities from camera images. For the attacking purpose, we have generated poisonous collision and steering angle datasets for DroNet. The TrojAI software framework is used to generate poisonous datasets and Trojan models.

Ataky; F. Fambrini,2019,"The identification of crop areas marked by biotic and abiotic factors is a challenge in precision agriculture (PA). Remote sensing and supervised segmentation of hyperspectral images (HIs) have become a fast and precise solution of PA for the identification of problems in crops. However, wellknown problems for knowledge extraction in HIs are related to data volumes and capacity for modeling each phenomenal due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. Some techniques for dealing with dimensionality, such as genetic algorithms (GAs), are promising, but they cannot assure a compromise between the segmentation effectiveness and reduction of dimensionality. In this paper, a multi-objective method based on Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 2 and Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier is proposed for supervised segmentation of HIs dealing with the problem of dimensionality. Experiments with three datasets and cross-validation showed that the proposed method reduced the average number of bands between 75.4% and 88.2% for each evaluation. In addition to reducing the number of bands, statistical tests showed that our method had a pixel classification performance equivalent or more significant than other state-of-the-art methods. Based on the results, the method is promising for band selection in HIs and can contribute to segmentation.",no,"The paper uses three datasets for precision agriculture, but their geographical origin is not specified as exclusively Italian.",

Zollo,2024,"Dynamic Motion Primitives (DMPs) only address the generalization problem for target positions that are close to the demonstration position and in order to enhance the generalization capability, by making the learned movements executable in the entire reachable robot workspace, multiple demonstrations are needed, resulting in an increase in the time required to teach new tasks to the robot. This work aims to propose a novel approach to scale the DMP parameters through two demonstrations in order to enhance the DMP’s generalization capability in the robot reachable workspace while guaranteeing a fast and easy learning phase. The proposed method to scale the DMP parameters relies on a linear interpolation performed on the DMP parameters extracted by two demonstrations and is applied to the agricultural field, where the adoption of DMPs can provide a promising solution to meet the demand for a wide range of tasks in an ever-changing and mutable agricultural environment. Four agricultural activities, namely digging, seeding, irrigation, and harvesting, have been learned by the robot using DMPs. The experimental validation was carried out on the Tiago robot and the proposed approach, based on two demonstrations, was compared to two literature methods based on a single demonstration and multiple demonstrations in terms of accuracy of the motion reconstruction, success rate of task execution and speed of the learning process. The obtained results demonstrated that the proposed approach, based on two demonstrations, guarantees a successful execution of the four tasks without exceeding the robot reachable workspace and with acceptable accuracy (mean success rate of task execution is about 95.6%) and a fast training phase (about 70 minutes less than the database approach that is built on multiple demonstrations).",no,The abstract describes data generated for a specific experiment and does not mention a dataset with national Italian coverage.,

This study delves into the forestry sector in Sweden, explicitly addressing the critical early phases of pine tree development within controlled en-vironments, predominantly nurseries and specialised facilities. To tackle the complexities of temporal classification in pine tree growth, we propose a novel measurement system that uses image data to leverage the power of different deep transfer learning-based convolutional neural networks. To classify pine trees over time, our approach integrates different state-of-the-art transfer learning models based on the features extracted by SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, ShuffieNet, and ResNetXt into our measurement system. The primary challenge in tem-porally sorting plant growth is that instances within the same class exhibit variations, whereas instances belonging to different classes may share similarities. We also addressed a pivotal question: whether focusing on the region of interest (ROI) as the input improves the final results. To explore this, we defined two distinct scenarios and conducted a comparative analysis to elucidate the impact of varied input images on the efficacy of our measurement systems.

Kise,2021,"This paper proposes the first object counting method for omnidirectional images. Because conventional object counting methods cannot handle the distortion of omnidirectional images, we propose to process them using stereographic projection, which enables conventional methods to obtain a good approximation of the density function. However, the images obtained by stereographic projection are still distorted. Hence, to manage this distortion, we propose two methods. One is a new data augmentation method designed for the stereographic projection of omnidirectional images. The other is a distortion-adaptive Gaussian kernel that generates a density map ground truth while taking into account the distortion of stereographic projection. Using the counting of grape bunches as a case study, we constructed an original grape-bunch image dataset consisting of omnidirectional images and conducted experiments to evaluate the proposed method.

Günder; W. Gajda; A. -K. Mahlein,2023,"In the field of vegetation remote sensing, the concept and conversion across scales has been addressed—but not concluded-in recent years. A large array of different sensors is deployed using various platforms such as uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites. In this context, while multiple concepts of scale exist, the influence of spatial scale plays a major role when comparing and validating optical data derived from either of these platforms. Until to date, no satisfying method to allow cross sensor and scale studies exists. The presented work proposes a custom U-Net architecture to convert multispectral UAV imagery to multispectral satellite imagery. U-Nets are convolutional networks that have shown to be capable of learning mapping patterns between an input image and an output image. Therefore, artificially created images resembles original images at a high level of local detail and global semantic coherence. By using a multi-year, multispectral image UAV dataset, capturing a biologically and structural complex pathosystem (Cercosopora beticola + Beta vulgaris L.), it is shown that the developed custom U-Net can convert original UAV images with low structural and spectral error (MSE of 0.0001, SSIM test score of 0.0003, DWT test score of 0.0104, and a PSNR value of 40.3551) into artificial satellite images. Also, it is compared whether band center and bandwidth are accurately converted. To showcase an application, artificial images have been used to classify levels of Cercospora Leaf Spot in sugar beet. Classification accuracies are similar to those derived from the classification using original images. Therefore, it can be concluded that image to image translation using U-Nets can be a powerful tool for scaling studies in remote sensing. But they also offer to address the issue of data sparsity in machine learning as the conversion allows to generate images across different scales, therefore potentially adding valuable data to time-series studies.",no,The abstract mentions a UAV dataset but does not specify its geographical coverage as exclusively Italian.,

Contrary to blind solutions that often rely on borders and corners detection, the proposed approach requires a classification a priori along with a list of predefined models. The matching and accurate localization are performed using specific ID document features. This process is especially difficult due to the intrinsic variable nature of ID models (text fields, multi-pass printing with offset, unstable layouts, added artifacts, blinking security elements, nonrigid materials). We tackle the problem by putting different combinations of features in competition within a multi-hypothesis exploration where only the best document quadrilateral candidate is retained thanks to a custom visual similarity metric.

Bäck,2021,"Some real-world domains, such as Agriculture and Healthcare, comprise early-stage disease indications whose recording constitutes a rare event, and yet, whose precise detection at that stage is critical. In this type of highly imbalanced classification problems, which encompass complex features, deep learning (DL) is much needed because of its strong detection capabilities. At the same time, DL is observed in practice to favor majority over minority classes and consequently suffer from inaccurate detection of the targeted early-stage indications. To simulate such scenarios, we artificially generate skewness (99% vs. 1%) for certain plant types out of the PlantVillage dataset as a basis for classification of scarce visual cues through transfer learning. By randomly and unevenly picking healthy and unhealthy samples from certain plant types to form a training set, we consider a base experiment as fine-tuning ResNet34 and VGG19 architectures and then testing the model performance on a balanced dataset of healthy and unhealthy images. We empirically observe that the initial F1 test score jumps from 0.29 to 0.95 for the minority class upon adding a final Batch Normalization (BN) layer just before the output layer in VGG19. We demonstrate that utilizing an additional BN layer before the output layer in modern CNN architectures has a considerable impact in terms of minimizing the training time and testing error for minority classes in highly imbalanced data sets. Moreover, when the final BN is employed, minimizing the loss function may not be the best way to assure a high F1 test score for minority classes in such problems. That is, the network might perform better even if it is not `confident' enough while making a prediction; leading to another discussion about why softmax output is not a good uncertainty measure for DL models.

By applying a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique to a large set of natural spectra, we show that the spectra of natural scenes lie on an intrinsically low dimensional manifold.

Our main intensive is to enhance the livelihood of coconut leaves and identify the diseases at the early stage so that farmers get more benefits from coconut production. This paper proposes the detection of pest attack and nutrient deficiency in the coconut leaves and analysis of the diseases. Coconut leaves monitorization has been taken place after the use of pesticides and fertilizer with the help of the finest machine learning and image processing techniques. Rather than human experts, automatic recognition will be beneficial and the fastest approach to identify the diseases in the coconut leaves very efficiently. Thus, in this project, we developed an android mobile application to identify the pests by their food behaviors, pest diseases and the nutrition deficiencies in the coconut trees. As an initial step, all datasets for image processing technology met pre-processing steps such as converting RGB to greyscale, filtering, resizing, horizontal flip and vertical flip. After completing the above steps, the classification was performed by analyzing several algorithms in the literature review.

Climate change increases both the frequency and the intensity of such shocks. To safeguard farmers' income and food production, climate adaptation measures are required. This article aims to examine the effectiveness of crop diversification as an adaptation measure, using Italy as a case study. We apply a control function approach to a panel dataset of 20,790 Italian farms, which considers (i) the crop diversification decision and (ii) the influence of crop diversification on farmers' levels of crop income and income risk. We find that, while specialisation can increase income, crop diversification reduces income risk most effectively when growing four different crops. At this level of diversification, income risk is approximately 29% lower as opposed to monoculture farming. Although the Common Agricultural Policy's greening payments for crop diversification make sense from an ecological and risk-reducing point of view, we find that they are potentially insufficient to cover the loss of expected crop income from diversification. While crop diversification reduces income risk in general, we find no specific benefit in terms of weather shock-induced risks. This may be because a price increase following a weather shock buffers its adverse effect.

More specifically, land consumption (LC), due to the occupation of originally agricultural, natural, or semi-natural areas, implies a progressive loss of key environmental resources and ecosystem services (ESs), reducing the individual well-being. Furthermore, policy makers need data on the benefits of public goods in monetary terms to support well-being-oriented decision-making. This work seeks to demonstrate that life satisfaction approach (LSA) can be applied to a practical assessment goal with the intention to give a monetary value to the LC and consequently to a loss of important ESs. The Italian case study is investigated with the help of a national survey database reporting the subjective well-being index (SWBI) subsequently grouped by regions. The overall intent is to make explicit to the policymakers that biodiversity and ESs are valuable to society and that their further degradation will result in irreversible damages to local communities. Using nationally representative data from the Multi-Purpose Survey on Italian Families in Italy over 2012–2016, results suggest that the national average annual income willingness to accept (WTA) related to consumed land is equal to −0.0827 €/m2 on average, while the social cost for LC and the loss of related ESs affects 0.01% of the Italian GDP per year. Finally, the possibility of estimating and comparing the WTA with the land market values brings the method presented here closer to cost-based estimates overcoming the limitations of contingent valuation methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract mentions using a national survey database for Italy to study land consumption of agricultural areas, meeting all inclusion criteria.",Multi-Purpose Survey on Italian Families

The study hypothesis is that collective initiatives exerting countervailing power can attenuate the imbalance in the distribution of bargaining power that is considered one of the main causes of unfair trading practices. Our findings suggest that in a multidimensional bargaining setting where all contract terms are negotiated at once, there is no theoretical expectation that exerting countervailing power necessarily results in a mitigation of unfair trading practices. To investigate the topic empirically, we used a data set measuring fairness perception of a sample of Italian kiwifruit producers. The data support the hypothesis that membership in collective initiatives increases the probability that a farmer perceives a transaction as fair. However, countervailing power does not counter all unfair practices in the same way. While patrons of collective initiatives perceive benefits in price and quality determination practices, no such effect was found for contract renegotiation. The analysis compares two policy approaches: supporting countervailing power and banning specific practices (such as EU Directive 633/2019). We conclude that countervailing power is less effective in targeting specific unfair practices, but it is less likely to determine efficiency loss because it does not impose constraints on contractual negotiations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",maybe,"The abstract mentions a dataset of Italian kiwifruit producers, but it is unclear if this dataset has national-level coverage or is from a specific region.",

In this context, sustainability assessment implies considering different aspects of agricultural activities, including environmental, economic and social issues, and it is usually based on practice-based indicators. However, proposed methods and applications are still rare due to the difficulty to build a strong general framework and to find appropriate data. The present work develops a performance indicator framework using farm accounting data from the Italian Agricultural Accounting Information Network and proposes a multi-criteria approach based on the multiple reference point weak-strong composite indicators (MRP-WSCI) method to assess the degree of sustainability at the farm level. This method, widely applied to sustainability assessment, calculates the relative rankings including the weak and strong approaches to sustainability and facilitates an understanding of the different indices used, but it is still unused in the agricultural sector. The proposed evaluation framework shows that MRP-WSCI can handle a holistic set of indicators and rank the farms according to their level of sustainability, making it suitable for the agricultural farm sustainability assessment. Our results show that none of the farms in the case study sample can be classified as “good,” according to some of the indices produced, that is, the strong–strong and strong–weak index, while just two of them are good for the weak–weak index.

The analysis is based on a three-year period (2018–2020). The sample consists of 1693 farms, outliers excluded. The treated farms included in the FADN sample total 134. The variables used are both structural and economic. The statistical analysis carried out compares treated and non-treated farms using the Welch-t-test. The results show that some key variables are significant (area; labour; revenues and costs). In general, the treated farms are more likely to improve their production process through EU funding and through new investments. In conclusion, the ISCP could be a good opportunity to support the sector. This work suggests that beneficiaries could achieve higher economic performance, especially when carrying out diversified activities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract mentions the use of two national-level Italian datasets (Italian Rural Network database and FADN), meeting all criteria.",Italian Rural Network database;Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network;FADN

This European agricultural policy has adapted to the contemporary challenges faced by the new model of agricultural development. It aims to enhance the contribution of agriculture to the EU’s environmental and climate objectives while providing better targeted support to small-scale farmers to promote farms’ competitiveness. The main objective of this paper is to describe Italian farms and classify them into groups based on their main characteristics, as well as to analyze their performance and behavior in terms of sustainability and competitiveness. The novelty and innovativeness of this study are found in the data used; a 2020 dataset from the Italian Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN) was used. The quality of FADN data in farm sustainability assessment is widely acknowledge in the literature. To achieve the purpose of this study, a multivariate analysis, in particular, the Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and a Cluster Analysis (CA) were applied. These analyses helped us to obtain the factorial axes which then enabled us to identify economic information on farms, and a better interpretation of farmers’ aptitude to undertake environmentally friendly actions. As a result, eight groups of farms were identified, and their characteristics and performance were described at Italian district level. The results of the study reflect the influence of European interventions towards encouraging farmers to use more environmentally friendly agricultural practices. Under this perspective, the findings contribute to the current debate on green architecture pursued by the future European agricultural policy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract explicitly states the use of the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), which is a national-level dataset for Italy.",Italian Farm Accounting Data Network;FADN

The analysis is based on the calculation of the inverse of Herfindahl index, by using different variables available in the Italian FADN database (years 2008, 2013 and 2018), followed by a multiple regression model to analyse the relationship between the diversification index and other variables, in order to highlight both the internal and external factors affecting on-farm diversification processes. The article shows that Italian farms have increasingly adopted non-agricultural revenue diversification strategies to reduce risk and maximize factors’ productivity. Among these, agritourism is by far the most relevant; however, in the last few years the production of renewable energy has been growing relatively rapidly. Overall, the study shows that on-farm diversification activities can be either an opportunity for a new entrepreneurship in agriculture or a survival strategy for small and marginal farms that are not sufficiently integrated in the national agri-food system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract explicitly mentions the use of the Italian FADN database, which is an agricultural dataset with national coverage for Italy.",Italian FADN

These processes have impacted genome shaping in terms of inbreeding and regions under selection and resulted in differences between the northern and southern populations. Both inbreeding and signatures of selection can be pinpointed by the analysis of runs of homozygosity (ROH), which provides useful information to assist the management of this species in different rural areas. Results: We analyzed the ROH distribution and inbreeding (F<inf>ROH</inf>) in 902 goats from the Italian Goat Consortium2 dataset. We evaluated the differences in individual ROH number and length between goat breeds from Northern (NRD) and Central-southern (CSD) Italy. Then, we identified the signatures of selection that differentiate these two groups using three methods: ROH, ΔROH, and averaged F<inf>ST</inf>. ROH analyses showed that some Italian goat breeds have a lower inbreeding coefficient, which is attributable to their management and history. ROH are longer in breeds that are undergoing non-optimal management or with small population size. In several small breeds, the ROH length classes are balanced, reflecting more accurate mating planning. The differences in climate and management between the NRD and CSD groups have resulted in different ROH lengths and numbers: the NRD populations bred in isolated valleys present more and shorter ROH segments, while the CSD populations have fewer and longer ROH, which is likely due to the fact that they have undergone more admixture events during the horizontal transhumance practice followed by a more recent standardization. We identified four genes within signatures of selection on chromosome 11 related to fertility in the NRD group, and 23 genes on chromosomes 5 and 6 related to growth in the CSD group. Finally, we identified 17 genes on chromosome 12 related to environmental adaptation and body size with high homozygosity in both groups. Conclusions: These results show how different management practices have impacted the level of genomic inbreeding in two Italian goat groups and could be useful to assist management in a low-input system while safeguarding the diversity of small populations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract clearly states the use of the 'Italian Goat Consortium2 dataset', which is an agricultural dataset with national coverage for Italy.",Italian Goat Consortium2 dataset

The efficiency in the use of the resources depends on the type of food which is produced and the adopted processes. In any case if food is discarded or lost at any step of the supply chain this represents a waste of energy and resources. For this reason, the LIFE project irexfo, coordinated by the University of Perugia has proposed a way to promote a business model aiming at both: the reduction of food losses and also the reuse of the not comestible food waste in biogas plants. The model has been tested in Umbria as a pilot region and in this study the results obtained are scaled up to a national level and applied to the Italian IO database reported in the EXIOBASE, to evaluate which could be the benefits of the application of the irexfo business model to the whole Italian agroindustry sector and also the interrelations between this sector and the Italian energy sector.

One of the most important measures is the Agrobiodiversity National Register (ANR), but 12 Italian regions currently appear without any landraces and around 80% of the landraces listed are trees, with less detailed data on herbaceous species. The aim of this study is to investigate the situation for Italian herbaceous landraces preserved on farms (in situ) by merging and analyzing data contained in the main databases on plant agrobiodiversity in Italy. Data were georeferenced, organized by botanic families and Italian regions, and analyzed by GIS and R. A total of 1615 herbaceous landraces were found (versus the 416 recorded in the ANR).

It collects information suitable for use in performing structural and socioeconomic analysis of the agricultural sector in all the Member States. Contents and purposes have evolved over the time depending on the informative needs of the EU Commission and CAP's priorities. As a part of the Green Deal, CAP is expected to contribute to the environment, climate change and biodiversity objectives beyond 2020. In this new framework, one initiative launched inside the Farm to Fork Strategy has been the change of name from FADN to Farm Sustainability Data Network (FSDN) including variables related to the environmental and social aspects of farming. Like in other EU countries, the information collected by the Italian FADN exceeds that required by the EU regulations, allowing to some extent consideration of special characteristics of national agriculture. However, further variables could be added or changed, gathering them directly from the farmer, by including the existing database or through targeted questionnaires on FADN sub-samples. The new survey will maintain and improve the current role of FADN, reinforcing the analytical and political relevance of the network by adding further dimensions of sustainability. The discussion is on-going at EU and National level and this paper is a contribution to this debate. It gives a description of the environmental and social data gathered by the Italian FADN together with a consideration regarding about the opportunity and the possibility to enhance the system in view of the future period under evaluation.

Therefore, an efficient ecotoxicological approach to metal contamination is the measure of bioaccumulation level in target organisms. In this work, we characterized the heavy metal bioaccumulation in honey bees, Apis mellifera ligustica, collected at 35 sites from Umbria (Central Italy). The comparison of our data with selected Italian investigations revealed metal bioaccumulation in honey bee matrix of the same order of magnitude, with Cd showing a higher variability. To generalize the results, we developed a Honeybee Contamination Index (HCI) based on metal bioaccumulation in honey bees. An application of the HCI to the present dataset revealed cases of low (sixteen sites), intermediate (eighteen sites), and high (one site) metal contaminations. The comparison of HCI values from the Umbrian dataset with values calculated for other Italian and European metadata showed that most of the Umbrian sites fell in the portion of low and intermediate contamination conditions. HCI represented a reliable tool that provided a piece of concise information on metal contamination in terrestrial environments. Parallel to this effort, we have determined, the metal concentrations in the airborne particulate matter (PM<inf>10</inf>) at three regional background-monitoring stations in Umbria. These stations are representative of the average air quality of the areas of the investigated apiaries.

A comparative analysis of the Italian data collection systems related to fatal tractor accidents in agriculture was performed focusing on tractor rollover fatalities with the aim of analyzing the accident scenario. Method: Data from the Operational Archives of the Italian Workers Compensation Authority (INAIL), which collects injuries of workers covered by compulsory accident insurance and those of the National Surveillance System (INAIL_ASL), which provides narrative text reports of work-related fatal accidents have been analyzed and compared to the information collected by the INAIL Observatory. The INAL Observatory was recently set up to complement the collection of fatal accidents involving agricultural machinery. Italian data were then compared to data available at an international level. Fatal tractor accidents vary considerably with respect to fatal accidents in agriculture, being 10.6 and 43.7% for the Operational Archives and Surveillance System, respectively. National Surveillance System records, implemented with narrative texts allowed the accident scenario to be defined. Results: 71.7% of fatal tractor-related accidents refer to non-ROPS equipped vehicles and of these, 26.5% involved machines originally mounted with a ROPS that had been removed or was inoperative in the folded-down position during the rollover event. Just one fatal event from a collapsed ROPS on the overturned tractor was recorded. It is interesting that 16.6% of fatal accidents involved a clear environmental factor. Practical application: A campaign to train tractor drivers on the correct use of the combination ROPS and seatbelt can contribute to decreasing rollover events with fatal outcomes. Contemporarily a strict requirement to install ROPS and a seatbelt on tractors, combined to an official inspection at the farm level, can increase the chance of survival in a rollover accident. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The paper analyzes and compares multiple Italian data sources related to agricultural accidents: the Operational Archives of INAIL, the National Surveillance System (INAIL_ASL), and the INAIL Observatory.",Operational Archives of the Italian Workers Compensation Authority (INAIL); National Surveillance System (INAIL_ASL); INAIL Observatory

The model was calibrated and validated in a previous modelling study using long-term weather data from the same experimental sites and agronomic data-sets of the same sites and varieties over the period 1973–2004. To assess the responses of durum wheat varieties to climate changes, 48 synthetic climates based on the combination of increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall were used to represent paths of possible future climate change. The simulated impacts of climate projections on durum wheat varieties at both sites were: grain yield reduction, slightly increasing kernel weight, and earlier anthesis dates. The late variety Creso showed a larger grain yield reduction compared to the early genotypes Duilio and Simeto. Anticipation of time to flowering was larger at Ussana (medium-low fertility soil) than at Benatzu (high fertility soil) with no differences between varieties. Earlier anthesis response was due to temperature increase rather than rainfall reduction, since in the CERES-Wheat model as well as in the majority of crop growth models water availability has no effect on crop development rate. Predictions for kernel weight were more uncertain with a slightly increasing trend in response to increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall. The CERES-Wheat crop model seems to capture fairly well the greater resilience shown by early genotypes in Mediterranean rainfed conditions. In general, the CERES-Wheat model showed results in line with the findings from real experiments in different pedoclimatic conditions. For these reasons, CERES-Wheat appeared to be reliable when used to evaluate plant responses to projected climate change conditions and can represent a useful tool for developing adaptation strategies and measures such as the choice and selection of adapted genotypes to tackle the negative impact of climate change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The study uses long-term weather data and agronomic datasets from two experimental sites in Sardinia, Italy, to calibrate and validate a crop model.

10.13128/BAE-14625,A spatial analysis of terrain features and farming styles in a disadvantaged area of Tuscany (Mugello): Implications for the evaluation and the design of CAP payments,"L., Fastelli, Laura; C., Landi, Chiara; M., Rovai, Massimo; M., Andreoli, Maria",2017,"In recent times there has been a growing awareness of the role of agriculture in providing public goods and services, in particular in less favoured areas. However, since agriculture is an economic activity, its permanence implies that it should be able to generate a satisfactory income for farmers. Where this is not possible, due to natural constraints or adverse economic and market conditions, in order to maintain an adequate use of farmland it is necessary to provide public aid to farmers. In this framework, the design of proper interventions aimed to promote rural development in less favoured areas should be based on a deep knowledge at the farm and territorial level. As regards the territorial level, the RDP zoning [art. 11 Reg. Ce 1698/2005] developed by Member States on the base of the guidelines provided by the European Commission is very often not sufficient to adequately define the territorial characteristics of rural areas. The use of GIS techniques may help to handle this issue by providing a better and more detailed knowledge at the territorial level. Farm level is important insofar as aid effectiveness is usually strongly depending on the type of farm that is receiving it. Thus, a careful selection of beneficiaries could determine a more effective and efficient distribution of resources. This paper aims to provide a spatial analysis of natural constraints and types of farming style in Mugello area and to analyse their relations with CAP aid distribution. Both Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and Rural Development Programme (RDP) payments have been taken into account. The paper combines a GIS analysis of terrain features with the theoretical approach of farming styles. For this purpose, the study integrates several sources of data: the 2010 Italian Agriculture Census, the Tuscany Regional Agency for Payments in Agriculture (ARTEA) database, and land cover data from the database Corine Land Cover (CLC-06), as updated to 2007 by LAMMA (Laboratory for Environment Monitoring and Modelling). A geo-referenced database including socioeconomic attributes of farms, land use, and terrain characteristics has been generated in order to merge information at territorial and farm level. The results of this integrated analysis confirm that Mugello is a very heterogeneous area as regards terrain characteristics despite the fact that it is totally included in less favoured areas. On the other side, farm strategies and economic results seem to be related to entrepreneurial characteristics as much as to natural constraints. The analysis of Pillar I payments and RDP payments for farms located in this mountainous area shows a very complex situation where the strategies implemented by farmers of the strongest farming styles may successfully counteract natural constraints. Besides, in the Authors' opinion, the analyses performed highlight the importance of spatial analysis as a tool for evaluating how public resources are distributed on a territory, thus providing also useful information on the way this distribution could be improved, e.g. for ensuring a higher level of environmental services. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",no,"The study uses Corine Land Cover, which is a European-wide dataset, thus violating the inclusion criterion of exclusively Italian coverage.",

We developed such a BBCH model using an existing approach (Habekotté 1997). The new model describes winter OSR development by a combination of differential and conversion equations based on the structure of the BRASNAP-PH model (Habekotté 1997). Six phenological phases were reproduced daily according to the BBCH codes (00-89): emergence (00-09), leaf development (10-19), stem elongation (30-39), inflorescence emergence (50-59), flowering (60-69) and pod development-maturation period (70-89). The model takes into account temperature (including vernalisation) and photoperiod as the main environmental forces affecting crop phenology. The macro stages of leaf development and shooting were reproduced considering the rates of leaf appearance and internode extension. Model calibration and validation were performed using an extensive database of phenological observations collected from several experimental sites across France (n≤144), Germany (n≤839) and Italy (n≤577). The stability of the parameterisation was checked by a cross-calibration procedure. Applied to the independent datasets used for validation and cross-validation, the model was able to predict the whole-crop cycle with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.8 and 3.2 BBCH stages, respectively. Particularly accurate predictions of winter OSR development were obtained with the Italian datasets (RMSE: 2.1 and 2.3 BBCH stages for validation and cross-validation, respectively).

A comparison between agritourisms and other farms in italy using farm accountancy data network dataset,"L., Mastronardi, Luigi; V., Giaccio, Vincenzo; A., Giannelli, Agostino; A., Scardera, Alfonso",2015,"This paper presents the results of research regarding the environmental performances of Italian farms with agritourism compared with farms without agritourism. In Italy, agritourism is considered an agricultural activity and can only be performed by a farmer. Moreover, Italian national legislation forces the farmer to dedicate himself mainly to traditional farming, rather than to tourism activities. For this reason, environmental performances have been highlighted by analyzing only features and production systems of the farms. By utilizing the most frequent indicators used in studies regarding sustainability, the authors show how Italian agritourisms tend to develop more environmentally friendly agricultural methods, which have a positive impact on biodiversity, landscape and natural resources. The empirical analysis is based on the Italian FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) dataset. The European FADN was created to represent farms’ technical and economic operation in the European Union and on which it drafts the agricultural and rural policies. The dichotomous structure of the dependent variable (presence or absence of agritourism at the farm) has a propensity for an assessment method based on Binary Response Model Regression. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",yes,"The abstract clearly states the analysis is based on the 'Italian FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) dataset', which meets all inclusion criteria.",Italian FADN

After the evaluation of the importance of irrigation investments for the competitiveness of Italian agriculture, the report contains an overview of the impacts of climate change in agriculture and of the economic models to estimate such impact; than it reports an econometric analysis to estimate the role of irrigation for Italian agriculture. Data used came from the database FADN. They refer to observations at farms level for the period 1990-2010. The main results of the econometric analysis are that irrigation of fruit and vegetable crops is particularly relevant to the northeast of the country (with an increase in income estimated in the order of 14%), and, the relevance of the irrigation of arable crops is related to the whole country (even if the most important impact has been observed for the south of Italy and the islands where we observed an increase in income of about 12%). In the second part the paper analyzes irrigation management in the different river basin districts. The analysis, made by OTE, shows a different degree of efficiency of irrigation in relation to the main characteristics of crops areas: in the Padano district and in the district of Alpi Orientali, with reference to cereals and fruit, irrigation management seems to be characterized by a lower level of efficiency; same situation is presented in the district of Sicily with refers to the cultivation of cereals.

However, such data is often not generally applicable to all product systems since, especially concerning the agri-food sector, available datasets may not be fully representative of the site specificity of the food product under examination. In this context, the present work investigates the background, sources and methodological aspects that characterise the most known commercial databases containing agri-food data, with a focus on four agri-food supply chains (olive oil, wine, wheat products and citrus fruit), which represent an important asset for the Italian food sector. Methods Specifically, the paper entails a review of currently available LCI databases and their datasets with a twofold scope: firstly, to understand how agri-food data is modelled in these databases for a coherent and consistent representation of regional scenarios and to verify whether they are also suitable for the Italian context and, secondly, to identify and analyse useful and relevant methodological approaches implemented in the existing LCI databases when regional data are modelled. Results Based on the aforementioned review, it is possible to highlight some problems which may arise when developing an LCI pertaining to the four Italian agri-food supply chains, namely: 1. The need for specific inventory datasets to tackle the specificities of agri-food product systems. 2. The lack of datasets, within the existing DBs, related to the Italian context and to the abovementioned supply chains. In fact, at present, in the currently available LCI DBs, there are very few (or in some cases none) datasets related to Italian wine, olive oil, wheat-based products and citrus fruit. The few available datasets often contain some data related to the Italian context but also approximate data with that of product systems representing other countries. Furthermore, the present study allowed to identify and discuss the main aspects to be used as starting elements for modelling regional data to be included in a future Italian LCI database of the abovementioned four supply chains. Conclusions The results of the present study represent a starting point for the collection of data and its organisation, in order to develop an Italian LCI agri-food database with datasets which are representative of the regional specificities of four agri-food supply chains which play an important role in the Italian economy.",no,The paper is a review and a proposal for a future Italian LCI database; it does not use or produce a dataset with national Italian coverage.,

B.",2021,"This study evaluates the accuracy of daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo), computed according to the FAO Penman-Monteith equation by using a set of input weather variables obtained by blending ERA5-Land (ERA5L) reanalysis data with surface incoming solar radiation (R-s) provided by the instruments on board the Meteosat geostationary satellites, operationally delivered by the Satellite Applications Facility on Climate Monitoring (CMSAF). Performance assessment was carried out in Sicily (southern Italy) by using data from 38 automatic ground weather stations (AWSs) for years 2003-2020. ERA5L and CM-SAF data were first downscaled and bias-corrected with a calibration dataset; ERA5L air temperature data were also downscaled by lapse-rate correction. ETo estimates obtained with the blended ERA5L and CM-SAF validation dataset (ERA5L+CM-SAF) were compared with two other ETo estimates respectively obtained by using ERA5L and interpolated ground weather data (IGD). Performance indicators of the IGD dataset were evaluated by recursively applying universal kriging or ordinary kriging to the observed weather data, according to a cross-validation procedure. R-s provided by CM-SAF outperformed R s obtained by ground interpolation, thus confirming the convenience of using bias-corrected CM-SAF data even when ground observations are available in the study area. ETo estimates with ERA5L+CM-SAF showed a normalized RMSE of 12%, outperforming ERA5L ETo estimates while performing comparably to ETo estimates obtained with the IGD dataset. The results suggested that the proposed blended dataset is a good proxy for interpolated ground weather observations in the assessment of ETo at regional scale when weather measurements cannot be easily gathered or in data-sparse regions.",no,"The data sources used (ERA5-Land, CM-SAF) are global/regional, not exclusively Italian.

The crop reference evapotranspiration (ETo) represents the atmospheric water demand in each crop type, development stage, and management practices. The Penman-Monteith equation in the version suggested by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO56-PM), is one of the most used methods to estimate ETo. In several regions of the world, meteorological observations are not always available. The most recent reanalysis database ERA5-Land, released in 2019, can be useful to overcome this limit. The database provides, with a spatial grid of 0.1 degrees latitude and 0.1 degrees longitude, several hourly climate data such as air temperature, dew point temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed components all at 2.0 m above the soil surface, except wind speed components at 10 m, useful to apply the FAO56-PM equation. The objective of this research is to assess the quality of ERA5-Land climate variables data to estimate daily ETo in Sicily, Italy. The effect of the weather station's elevation associated with the statistical indicators was also evaluated to verify how the morphology affects the measurements. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the FAO56-PM equation was carried out to identify which climate variables have the most influence on the ETo estimation. For the period 2006-2015, the comparison between air temperature, global solar radiation, wind speed, and relative air humidity, measured from 39 ground weather stations in Sicily, and ERA5-Land was carried out and then, through FAO56-PM equation daily ETo values were estimated using both databases.

A weed dataset was amassed from studies conducted independently by research groups during 1998-2013. Included were herbicide efficacy field trials and weed surveys from about 600 sites representing 175 northern and central Italy maize fields. The dataset was honed to results from untreated plots in which weed data were collected at least once (June/July) each season. For sites observed more often, only the survey with the highest weed species count was used.Of the approximate 120 species found, just five were present on more than 50% of sites: Chenopodium album, Echinochloa crus-galli, Amaranthus retroflexus, Solanum nigrum, and Persicaria maculosa. Indices were calculated to describe weed community structure: total weed species count, monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species counts, and total weed density. Additional soil and climate site data were collected or obtained from regional databases: pH reaction, texture, organic matter content, total nitrogen, Mg/K ratio, assimilable phosphorus, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and C/N ratio, annual total precipitation, annual mean temperature, and Thornthwaite climate classification. Pedo-climatic traits and weed indices relationships were investigated using linear correlation analysis (CA), discriminant analysis (DA), and principal component analysis (PCA).CA and PCA highlighted a weak bias (higher count and density) by monocotyledonous species for sand and alkaline soils, while clay and alkaline soils favored dicotyledonous species. DA classified the sites well based on weed indices using soil parameters as predictor variables, in particular for a Piemonte region (northwest Italy) data subset. Soil texture, CEC, pH, and some nutrient contents significantly predicted some weed indices. This study pointed out that Italian maize field weed communities are influenced by some pedoclimatic traits; the weak relationships observed might be mitigated by the overall influence of crop practices on weed dynamics.

In this work, we estimated the potential and effective nitrogen load from agriculture, farms, civil, and industrial sources in Umbria region, Italy, and assessed the previous (and actual) contamination by nitrates at different scales. The adopted methodology uses databases of the sources, such as the type of fertilizer (inorganic or manure), the type of industrial site, the census of livestock and field data at a local, basin, and regional scale. Hydrological and geological models are used to compute infiltration. The study shows that the contribution of farms to nitrate pollution is in the order of swine > cattle > sheep and goats; while the highest agricultural load is due to arable land, followed by olive and grape. The study also shows that municipalities that have values of nitrates over the threshold for both groundwater and surface water can rapidly change their status during consecutive years.

When SOC changes is estimated with legacy data, the use of soil samples collected in different plots (i.e., non-paired data) may lead to biased results. In the present work, N = 302 georeferenced soil samples were selected from a regional (Sicily, south of Italy) soil database. An operational sampling approach was developed to spot SOC concentration changes from 1994 to 2017 in the same plots at the 0-30 cm soil depth and tested. Results The measurements were conducted after computing the minimum number of samples needed to have a reliable estimate of SOC variation after 23 years. By applying an effect size based methodology, 30 out of 302 sites were resampled in 2017 to achieve a power of 80%, and an alpha = 0.05. A Wilcoxon test applied to the variation of SOC from 1994 to 2017 suggested that there was not a statistical difference in SOC concentration after 23 years (Z = - 0.556; 2-tailed asymptotic significance = 0.578). In particular, only 40% of resampled sites showed a higher SOC concentration than in 2017. Conclusions This finding contrasts with a previous SOC concentration increase that was found in 2008 (75.8% increase when estimated as differences of 2 models built with non-paired data), when compared to 1994 observed data (Z = - 9.119; 2-tailed asymptotic significance < 0.001).

Earth Observation data from satellite missions (often available for free) can certainly support analysis of climate change effects on vegetation, making possible to improve land management in space and time. Within this context, the present work aims at investigating natural and agricultural vegetation, as mapped by Corine Land Cover (CLC) dataset, focusing on phenological metrics trends that can be possibly conditioned by the ongoing climate-change. The study area consists of the entire Piemonte region (NW-Italy). MOD13Q1-v6 dataset from TERRA MODIS mission was used to describe pluri-annual (2001-2019) phenological behavior of vegetation focusing on the following CLC classes: Non-irrigated arable land, Vineyards, Pastures, and Forests. After computing and mapping some phenological metrics as derivable from the interpretation of at-pixel level NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) temporal profile, we found that the most significant one was the maximum annual NDVI (MaxNDVI). Consequently, its trend was analyzed at CLC class level for the whole Piemonte region. Natural and semi-natural vegetation classes (Pastures and Forests) were furtherly investigated testing significance of the Percent Total Variation (TV%) of MaxNDVI in the period 2001-2019 for different altitude classes. Results proved that Non-irrigated arable land showed a not significant trend of MaxNDVI; differently, vineyards and forests showed a significant increasing one. Concerning TV%, it was found that it increases with altitude for the Forests CLC class, while it decreases with altitude for the pastures class.",no,"The data sources used (MODIS, Corine Land Cover) are global/European, not exclusively Italian.

Calero Fuentes; Falaschetti, L.; Pau, D.; Tomaselli, V.; Turchetti, C.",2021,"Esca is one of the most common disease that can severely damage grapevine. This disease, if not properly treated in time, is the cause of vegetative stress or death of the attacked plant, with the consequence of losses in production as well as a rising risk of propagation to the closer grapevines. Nowadays, the detection of Esca is carried out manually through visual surveys usually done by agronomists, requiring enormous amount of time. Recently, image processing, computer vision and machine learning methods have been widely adopted for plant diseases classification. These methods can minimize the time spent for anomaly detection ensuring an early detection of Esca disease in grapevine plants that helps in preventing it to spread in the vineyards and in minimizing the financial loss to the wine producers. In this article, an image dataset of grapevine leaves is presented. The dataset holds grapevine leaves images belonging to two classes: unhealthy leaves acquired from plants affected by Esca disease and healthy leaves. The data presented has been collected to be used in a research project jointly developed by the Department of Information Engineering, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy and the STMicroelectronics, Italy, under the cooperation of the Umani Ronchi SPA winery, Osimo, Ancona, Marche, Italy.

Grapevine phenology is deeply influenced by climate and this paper aimed to analyze how phenological timing changed before and after the climatic change of 1994. Availability of thermal resources in the two climatic phases for the five altitudinal belts in the 0-1250-m range was analyzed. A phenological dataset gathered in two experimental sites during the period 2012-2014, and a suitable thermal dataset was used to calibrate a phenological model based on the normal approach and able to describe BBCH phenological stages 61 (beginning of flowering), 71 (fruit set), and 81 (veraison). Calibration was performed for four relevant Georgian varieties (Mtsvane Kakhuri, Rkatsiteli, Ojaleshi, and Saperavi). The model validation was performed on an independent 3-year dataset gathered in Gorizia (Italy). Furthermore, in the case of variety Rkatsiteli, the model was applied to the 1974-2013 thermal time series in order to obtain phenological maps of the Georgian territory. Results show that after the climate change of 1994, Rkatsiteli showed an advance, more relevant at higher altitudes where the whole increase of thermal resource was effectively translated in phenological advance. For instance the average advance of veraison was 5.9 days for 250-500 m asl belt and 18.1 days for 750-1000 m asl). On the other hand, at lower altitudes, phenological advance was depleted by superoptimal temperatures.

The availability of parallel measurements offers an ideal occasion to study these discontinuities as they record the same climate. The transition from manual to automatic measurements has been analysed in this study. The dataset has been obtained from two independent climate networks in the Piedmont region, in Northwest Italy. From this dataset, 17 pairs of stations with up to 17 years of overlapping have been identified. On average the overlapping period is 12 years with 8760 daily data matched for a pair of stations. This dataset has proven valuable because it has made it possible to study a set of independently managed pairs of standard-quality stations, while most previous studies in this field analysed data from well-maintained instruments with the same operator, often at meteorological offices. The transition between two networks has highlighted important differences in the amount of precipitation and in the number of rainy days. On average, the automatic network has measured 12% less precipitation and has recorded 9% more rainy days (8 days) per year than the manual network.

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the ability of the PRISMA hyperspectral imager to estimate topsoil properties (i.e., organic carbon, clay, sand, silt), in comparison with current satellite multispectral sensors. To investigate this expectation, a test was carried out using topsoil data collected in Italy following two approaches. Firstly, PRISMA, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 spectral simulated datasets were obtained from the spectral resampling of a laboratory soil library. Subsequently, bare soil reflectance data were obtained from two experimental areas in Italy, using real satellites images, at dates close to each other. The estimation models of soil properties were calibrated employing both Partial Least Square Regression and Cubist Regression algorithms. The results of the study revealed that the best accuracies in retrieving topsoil properties were obtained by PRISMA data, using both laboratory and real datasets. Indeed, the resampled spectra of the hyperspectral imager provided the best Ratio of Performance to Inter-Quartile distance (RPIQ) for clay (4.87), sand (3.80), and organic carbon (2.59) estimation, for the spectral soil library datasets. For the bare soil reflectance obtained from real satellite imagery, a higher level of prediction accuracy was obtained from PRISMA data, with RPIQ +/- SE values of 2.32 +/- 0.07 for clay, 3.85 +/- 0.19 for silt, and 3.51 +/- 0.16 for soil organic carbon. The results for the PRISMA hyperspectral satellite imagery with the Cubist Regression provided the best performance in the prediction of silt, sand, clay and SOC. The same variables were better estimated using PLSR models in the case of the resampled hyperspectral data.

In Europe, these two countries together produce more than half of the wines classified under the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) label, the strictest quality mark of food and wines in the European Union. Due to their long tradition in wine protection, Italy and France include highly detailed specifications in their wine PDO regulatory documents that are usually not available for other countries, such as specific information about the main cultivars that must be used to make each wine or the required planting density in the vineyards. However, this information is scattered throughout the documents of each wine production area and has never been extracted and homogenised in a unique dataset. Here, we present the first dataset that characterizes the PDO wines produced in Italy and France at very high detail based on the information from the official EU geographical indication register. For each country it includes a standardized list of the PDO wine names, linked with their specific requirements, such as the wine colour, type, cultivars used and maximum allowed yields. The unprecedented level of detail of this dataset al- lows for the first time the analysis of more than 5000 tra- ditional wines and their legal and agronomic specifications.

Potential chemical alternatives include herbicides authorized for the same uses as glyphosate that in this review were identified through searches of the pesticide databases of Italy, Spain, France, Germany, The Netherlands, and Estonia. Non-chemical control measures encompass mowing, tillage, and cover crops in agricultural areas and mowing, flaming, hot water, hot foam, and steam in non-agricultural areas.

Unfortunately, most of the ecological local studies are limited to the use of global data with coarse spatial resolutions, while fine-grain climate data are necessary to capture environmental variability and perform reliable modelling. We propose a high-resolution dataset (40 m grid) of the suite of original coarse-grain bioclimatic variables proposed by WorldClim 2 for the island of Sardinia (Italy); variations amongst our dataset and WorldClim 2 were calculated and mapped to show the spatial distribution of differences between all pairs of variables.We observed relevant differences for the bioclimatic variables related to rainfall (mean RMSE = 39.79; mean nRMSE = 0.21) compared to the temperature ones (mean RMSE = 4.81; mean nRMSE = 0.11). Moreover, discrepancies are not evenly distributed in the territory: the greater differences correspond to the areas characterized by complex orographic systems.Results recommend caution in making ecological assessments based on bioclimatic variables derived from global data with coarse spatial resolutions in physiographically complex landscapes, especially in the Mediterranean regions, characterized by seasonal climatic variations and high levels of biodiversity and biogeographical complexity.These new data will support a new generation of research studies in a broad array of ecological applications at a much finer scale than previously possible.",no,"The dataset covers only the island of Sardinia, not Italy at a national level as required by the inclusion criteria.",

The model applies the FAO56 dual K-c approach to compute the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc act) and its components, i.e., the actual tree transpiration (T-c act), obtained through the basal crop coefficient (K-cb), and soil evaporation according to an evaporation coefficient (K-e). Model calibration was performed by minimizing the difference between the predicted T-c act and the observed daily tree transpiration measured with sap flow instrumentation (T-SF field) acquired in 2009. The validation was performed using the independent data set of sap flow measurements from 2011. The calibrated K-cb was equal to 0.30 for the initial and non-growing season stages, 0.42 for the mid-season, and 0.37 for the end season. For both seasons, the goodness-of-fit indicators relative to comparing T-SF field with the simulated T-c act resulted in root mean square errors (RMSE) lower than 0.27 mm d(-1) and a slope of the linear regression close to 1.0 (0.94 <= b(0) <= 1.00). The olive grove water balance simulated with SIMDualKc produced a ratio between soil evaporation (E-s) and ETc act that averaged 39%. The ratio between actual (ETc act) and potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc) varied from 84% to about 99% in the mid-season, indicating that the values of ETc act are close to ETc, i.e., the adopted deficit irrigation led to limited water stress. The results confirm the suitability of the SIMDualKc model to apply the FAO56 dual K-c approach to tree crops, thus assessing the water use of olives and supporting the development of appropriate irrigation management tools that are usable by farmers. A different way to estimate K-cb is based on the approach suggested in 2009 by Allen and Pereira (A&P), which involves the measured fraction of ground covered (shaded) by the crop and the height of the trees. Its application to the studied grove produced the mid-season K-cb values ranging from 0.40-0.45 and end-season K-cb values ranging from 0.35-0.40. The comparison between the A&P-computed T-c act A&P and T-SF field shows RMSE values ranging from 0.27 to 0.43 mm d(-1), which demonstrates the adequacy of the latter approach for parameterizing water balance models and for irrigation scheduling decision making.",no,The data is from a single experimental site in Sicily and does not have national coverage of Italy.,

Its epidemiology at large scale is largely unknown. Several rice weed species have evolved resistant populations in Italy, including multiple resistant ones. The study objectives were to analyze the impact in Italian rice fields of major agronomic factors on the epidemiology of herbicide resistance and to generate a large-scale resistance risk map. The Italian Herbicide Resistance Working Group database was used to generate herbicide resistance maps. The distribution of resistant weed populations resulted as not homogeneous in the area studied, with two pockets where resistance had not been detected. To verify the situation, random sampling was done in the pockets where resistance had never been reported. Based on data from 230 Italian municipalities, three different statistics, stepwise discriminant analysis, stepwise logistic regression, and neural network, were used to correlate resistance distribution in the main Italian rice growing area with seeding type, rotation rate, and soil texture. Through the integration of complaint monitoring, mapping, and neural network analyses, we prove that a high risk of resistance evolution is associated with traditional rice cropping systems with intense monoculture rates and where water-seeding is widespread. This is the first study that determines the degree of association between herbicide resistance and a few important predictors at large scale. It also demonstrates that resistance is present in areas where it had never been reported through extensive complaint monitoring. However, these resistant populations cause medium-low density infestations, likely not alarming rice farmers. This highlights the importance of integrated agronomic techniques at cropping system level to prevent the diffusion and impact of herbicide resistance or limit it to an acceptable level.

NO3-N and several other soil properties of Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) monitoring network of 71 and 63 top-soils, respectively were measured in Venafro and Campomarino areas of Southern Italy (Molise region). Data analysis was performed firstly with classical descriptive statistics assuming spatial independence of samples; secondly, geostatistical analysis was performed in order to investigate spatial dependence and estimate map soil indices. The result of the distribution of NO3-N contents indicates the existence of many hot spots (high kurtosis) with high NO3-N concentration in both the study areas. Higher NO3-N levels in Venafro were distributed in the central zone that appeared to be correlated with animal manure applied to the fields in the summer strongly associated to high values of soil organic matter (SOM) and total nitrogen (Ntot). In Campomarino, the highest NO3-N concentrations occurred in random spots that appeared lesser correlated with high SOM content and low C/N ratio. Factor co-kriging analysis was applied separately to the two data sets to synthesize the complex multivariate variation of the two areas in a restricted number of zones so they could be ranked as at different risks of NO3-N leaching. The loading values of the factors indicate that Venafro SOM and clay and, to a lesser extent, Ntot and C/N are the variables that mainly affect the first factor at shorter range. On the other hand, cation exchangeable capacity (CEC) and, to a less extent, silt, SOM, C/N and fine sand content weighed more, but negatively, on the first factor at longer range. For Campomarino, clay content and available water capacity (AWC) and, to a lesser extent, NO3-N, weighed more and positively on the first factor at shorter range. The first factor at longer range was quite exclusively dominated by elevation and partially and negatively by pH and CaCO3. Soil factor map appears more variable in both the NVZ areas, characterized by many spots indicative of intensive land use and management. The highest NO3-N levels were found in intensive land use and in dairy farming located for the most part in Venafro catchment. The maps of the two factors at small scale for Campomarino appear to be quite erratic owing to the small size of the farms with different cropping systems differently managed. The results, of the present research, provide data useful to support land use planning and soil management, to mitigate soil nitrate leaching.

Among these, 26 sites provided 5, or more, years of data for time series analysis. Despite varied protocols, necessitating future harmonization, the average NH3 concentration across sites reached 8.0 +/- 8.9 mu g/m3. Excluding farming/agricultural hotspots (FAHs), IND and TR sites had the highest concentrations (4.7 +/- 3.2 and 4.5 +/- 1.0 mu g/m3), followed by UB, SUB, and RB sites (3.3 +/- 1.5, 2.7 +/- 1.3, and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mu g/m3, respectively) indicating that industrial, traffic, and other urban sources were primary contributors to NH3 outside FAH regions. When referring exclusively to the FAHs, concentrations ranged from 10.0 +/- 2.3 to 15.6 +/- 17.2 mu g/m3, with the highest concentrations being reached in RB sites close to the farming and agricultural sources, and that, on average for FAHs there is a decreasing NH3 concentration gradient towards the city. Time trends showed that over half of the sites (18/26) observed statistically significant trends. Approximately 50 % of UB and TR sites showed a decreasing trend, while 30 % an increasing one. Meta-analysis revealed a small insignificant decreasing trend for non-FAH RB sites. In FAHs, there was a significant upward trend at a rate of 3.51[0.45,6.57]%/yr. Seasonal patterns of NH3 concentrations varied, with urban areas experiencing fluctuations influenced by surrounding emissions, particularly in FAHs. Diel variation showed differing patterns at urban monitoring sites, all with higher daytime concentrations, but with variations in peak times depending on major emission sources and meteorological patterns.

From the spatial point of view, we chose to adopt the most detailed level available, by using the smallest land administrative unit (LAU) for every involved country (Spain, Portugal, France and Italy). The resulting database was made of about 16k records and seven fields for a total of 112k single data. The considered variables were: total farm area (TFA), utilized agricultural area (UAA), irrigated area (IA), arable lands (AL), permanent crops (PC), permanent grassland (PG) and remaining surface (RS). The LAU data analysis was carried out following the four steps: (i) level of land occupation by agricultural systems; (ii) patterns of crop groups in UAA composition; (iii) attribution to each LAU of an agricultural typology (AT), resulting from the combination of the two previous features and iv) calculation of two synthetic indices to evaluate the expansion and specialization level for each LAU. Finally, an analysis of the spatial distribution of the two indices was proposed. Results showed a lowering over time of the TFA, UAA and PG areas and an increase of IA and RS. The number of identified ATs was rising at the expense of their extension. This phenomenon led to a fragmentation in ATs spatial distribution within the same geographical region. These changes prove that farmers' responses to the driving forces acting on agricultural systems have been more differentiated than in the past. The prevailing strategy seems to aim at a reduction in the level of specialization of the agricultural systems whereas less marked was the lowering of their level of expansion.",no,"The dataset covers multiple Western Mediterranean countries (Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy), not exclusively Italy.",

The proposed pedo-transfer function (PTF) extends the Arya and Paris (AP) approach, which is based on particle size distribution (PSD), by incorporating aggregate-size distribution (ASD) into the PTF to obtain the bimodal WRC. A bimodal porosity approach was developed to quantify the fraction of each of the porous systems (matrix and macropores) in overall soil porosity. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-0, was obtained from WRC using the Kozeny-Carman equation, whose parameters were inferred from the behaviour of the bimodal WRC close to saturation. Finally, the Mualem model was applied to obtain the HCC. In order to calibrate the PTF, measured soil physical and hydraulic properties data were used, coming from field infiltration experiments from an irrigation sector of 140 ha area in the Sinistra Ofanto irrigation system in Apulia, southern Italy. The infiltration data were fitted by using both bimodal and unimodal hydraulic properties by an inverse solution of the Richards equation. The bimodal measured hydraulic properties were then used to calibrate the scaling parameter (alpha(AP)) of the proposed bimodal AP (bimAP) PTF. Similarly, for the sake of comparison with the bimodal results, the unimodal hydraulic properties were used to calibrate the aAP of the classical unimodal AP (unimAP) PTF. Compared to the unimAP PTF, the proposed bimAP significantly improves the predictions of the mean WRC parameters and K-0, as well as the prediction of the shape of the whole HCC. Moreover, compared to the unimodal approach, it also allows to reproduce statistics of the hydraulic parameters (for example, variance) similar to those observed in the calibration dataset. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was also applied to analyse the sensitivity of the bimodal aAP parameter to textural and structural features, confirming significant predictive effects of soil structure.",no,The data is from a very localized area in a single region (Apulia) and does not have national coverage.,

In spite of similarity of REE concentration in two countries, the median values of REE is higher than Italy but extreme concentration of REE in Italy is due to young volcanic activities.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to elucidate correlations and anomalies in the REE distribution. Results show that there is a clear correlation between REE anomalies and natural factors such as lithology of the underlying bedrock, the presence of mineralisations, pH of soils, climate and precipitation. According to the PCA results, anomalous behaviour of Eu, Ce, Tb and Gd can be explained by the dominant mineralogy of the parent material and the variable affinity of REEs to bind to clay minerals and clay-size particles.

The initial dataset included 3669 topsoil samples, collected at an average sampling density of 1 site per 2.3 km(2), and analyzed (after an aqua regia extraction) by a combination of ICP-AES and ICP-MS for 53 elements. Frequency based methods (Clr biplot, Enrichment Factor computation) and frequency spatial-method (fractal and multifractal plots) allowed identifying the relationships between the elements and their possible source patterns in Campania soils in relation to a natural occurring concentrations in geogenic material (rocks, soils and sediments) or human input. Results showed how the interpretation of concentration and behaviour of Al, Na, K and P was enhanced thanks to the application of data log-ratio transformation in univariate and multivariate analysis compared to the use of raw or log-normal data. Multivariate analyses with compositional biplot allowed the identification of four element associations and their potential association with the underling geology and/or human activities. When focusing on the smaller pool of elements (Al, P, K and Na), these relationships with the unique geology of the region, were largely confirmed by multifractal interpolated maps. However, when the local background was used for the calculation of the enrichment factor, the resulting interpolated maps allowed to identify smaller areas where the greater concentrations of P could not be possibly associated to a mineralisation (e.g., ultrapotassic rocks) but were more likely to be associated to anthropogenic input such as agriculture activities with potentially extensive use of phosphate fertilizers.

Conversely, the multi-regression approach improves the proportion of variance explained and gives statistically significative results in region where the single regression is not statically significant.The multi-regressive approach shows the added value of considering the interplay of different bioclimatic indices in explaining the overall variability of productivity.

The system boundaries were set from the calves' birth to their sale to the slaughterhouse, including the herd management, on- and off-farm feed production and materials used on the farms. One kilogram of body weight (BW) sold was used as the functional unit. The study involved 73 Charolais batches (i.e., a group of animals homogenous for age, finishing period and fattening farm), kept at 14 Italian farms. Data from 40 farms originating from the Charolais Network database (INRA) were used to characterize the French farm types, which were matched to the fattening batches according to the results of a cluster analysis. The impact categories assessed were as follows (mean +/- SD per kg BW): global warming potential (GWP, 13.0 +/- 0.7 kg CO2-eq, reduced to 9.9 +/- 0.7 kg CO2-eq when considering the carbon sequestration due to French suckler cow-calf system permanent grassland), acidification potential (AP, 193 +/- 13 g SO2-eq), eutrophication potential (EP, 57 +/- 4 g PO4-eq), cumulative energy demand (CED, 36 +/- 5 MJ), and land occupation (LO, 18.7 +/- 0.8 m(2)/year). The on-farm impacts outweighed those of the off-farm activities, except in the case of CED. On average, 41 MJ and 16.7 kg of dietary feed gross energy and protein were required to provide 1 MJ or 1 kg of protein of raw boneless beef, respectively, but nearly 85% and 80%, respectively, were derived from feedstuffs not suitable for human consumption. Emission-related (GWP, AP, EP) and resource utilization categories (CED, LO) were positively correlated. Food-related indicators showed positive correlations with emission-related indicators when the overall feedstuffs of the diet were considered but negative correlations when only the potentially human-edible portions of the beef diets were considered. In conclusion, the integration of the pasture-based France suckler cow-calf system with the cereal-based Italian fattening farms allows for the exploitation of the resources available, increasing the share of non-human-edible feedstuffs while maintaining good livestock productive efficiency.

The empirical analysis is based on a sample of about 11,000 farms from the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) dataset. Given that agritourisms represent a minority among farms, the sample is strongly imbalanced towards farms without agritourism activities. In order to avoid the difficulties arising when analyzing imbalanced samples, we use the Random Over-Sampling Examples (ROSE) approach that has been recently proposed in the statistical literature to obtain representative balanced samples from imbalanced ones. The empirical results show that landscape and environmental variables are important in shaping the probability that a farm runs agritourism activities. This results, together with others related to the economic dimension of the farm, its specialization, and the characteristics of the farmer make it possible to argue that there are areas of the country that can offer potential to agritourism, and that agritourism in turn can open new horizons in rural development with possible beneficial effects on the environment, the landscape, and the reduction of depopulation.

C.",2023,"In recent years there has been an increased demand for digital soil mapping (DSM) products. DSM has become the ultimate soil spatial representation framework due to its quantitative results, replicability, and uncertainty analysis. The present study aimed to map the probability distribution of the derived soil profiles (DSPs) of soil typological units (STUs). DSPs are statistical representation of the properties of the soil profiles belonging to STUs. STUs aggregate individual profiles into a group. The criteria used for grouping were homogeneity for World Reference Base (WRB) reference soil group (WRB-RSG), qualifiers (WRB-qu), and Soil Taxonomy particle size for the family classification (USDA-PS), and the belonging to a specific Soil Region. The European Soil Regions have been suggested as the primary grouping criteria for soil mapping at the European continental scale since they define continental-scale soilscapes, distinguished mainly by their climate and geology. To map DSPs, we firstly mapped STUs. The grouping criteria of STUs were mapped at 500 m spatial resolution, using a Neural Network trained on 18,707 georeferenced and analyzed soil profiles selected from the Italian national soil database. A 10% of the soil profiles were randomly sampled using a stratified sampling approach for validation. In particular, the procedure consisted of: i) mapping the grouping criteria WRB-RSG, WRB-qu, and USDA-PS, on a 500 m national grid, through Neural Network; ii) grouping soil profiles on the base of the combinations of grouping criteria (WRB-RSG, WRB-qu, USDA-PS, and Soil Regions) as mapped with the first step at each grid node, to produce a map of Soil Typological Units (STUs); iii) calculating statistics for the soil parameters of the groups of soil profiles created, to produce a map of Derived Soil Profiles (DSPs). DSPs statistics (average, standard deviation, and sample numerosity) were elaborated for the following parameters: soil rooting depth, pH (in water), soil organic carbon, clay, silt, sand, coarse fragments, and cation exchange capacity. The maps obtained were validated against the test set. The same test set was used for the comparison with the National benchmark map (Soils Map of Italy 1:1,000,000) and with the global scale SoilGrids at 250 m spatial resolution. The overall accuracy was 45.98% for the WRB-RSG map compared with the 30.74% of WRB-RSG as mapped with the Soil Map of Italy, and 28.79% as mapped with SoilGrids; 33.07% for WRB-qu compared with the 15.69% of WRB-qu as mapped with the Soil Map of Italy, and 12.45% as mapped with SoilGrids, and 45.48% for USDA-PS, not comparable with the National and Global benchmarks. Tau statistics showed a higher accuracy Kappa of our approach than in others, due to the unbalanced classes numerosity. The predictive ability in the validation of DSPs parameters resulted in a R2 of 0.35 for clay (0.16 with SoilGrids), 0.28 for sand (0.08 with SoilGrids), 0.18 for pH in water (0.21 with SoilGrids). The proposed approach produced harmonized soil type maps with higher accuracy than the previous generation of conventional field-based soil maps for the national benchmark and the calculation of the uncertainty. The STUs express variability of soil properties between groups so their knowledge might improve our understanding of the soil distribution, the planning of their management, monitoring, and the decisions for further surveys. A future challenge will be including more dynamic parameters in the criteria used to create STU, to help monitoring soil management effects.",yes,"The paper uses the Italian national soil database, which is an agricultural-related data source with national coverage.",Italian national soil database

In particular, direct analysis in real time (DART-MS) was explored as an ambient MS (AMS) source for the building of a top-quality Italian EVOOs database and fast identification of unknown samples. A single quadrupole detector (QDa) was coupled with DART, taking advantage of a cost-saving, user-friendly and less sophisticated instrumental setup. Particularly, quickstrip cards, located on a moving rail holder, were employed, allowing for the direct analysis of 12 EVOO spots in a total analysis time of 6 min. The aim was to develop a reliable statistical model by applying principal component and linear discriminant analyses to clusterize and classify EVOOs according to geographical origin and cultivar, as main factors determining their nutritional and sensory profiles. ResultsSatisfactory results were achieved in terms of identification reliability of unknown EVOOs, as well as false positive risk, thus confirming that the use of AMS combined with chemometrics is a powerful tool against fraudulent activities, without the need for mass accuracy data, which would increase the analysis cost. ConclusionA DART ionization source with a compact and reliable QDa MS analyser allowed for rapid fingerprinting analysis. Furthermore, MS spectra provided quali-quantitative information successfully related to EVOO differentiation. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

The impact of social capital and transparency on AFN performance,"De Bernardi, Paola; Bertello, Alberto; Venuti, Francesco; Foscolo, Enrico",2020,"Purpose Alternative food networks (AFNs) have recently emerged in the food landscape as new ways of food production, distribution and consumption which are alternatives to the traditional food system. Drawing on the tragedy of the commons, this paper aims to test the role played by social capital and transparency in reducing customer's lethargy and thus enhancing AFN performance in terms of frequency and quantity of purchases made by customers. Design/methodology/approach An ordered probit model was used to analyse data from a strong database of 2,115 Italian AFN customers. Given the novelty of the topic, the quantitative survey was anticipated by a preliminary qualitative study based on in-depth interviews, focus groups and participant observation. Findings Customers play an active role in AFN communities, co-creating value together with the other actors of the network. The two independent variables tested in this model, social capital and transparency, positively and significantly affect customers' quantity and frequency of purchases within AFNs, reducing the occurrence of the tragedy of commons. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this study represents one of the first attempts to measure, through a quantitative method, the effect of performance drivers (i.e. social capital and transparency) on AFN performance.

The coasts are affected by a marked natural subsidence, because of tectonic processes and recent sediments consolidation. Since the second half of the last century, the subsidence in coastal area has increased significantly due to intense human activity, namely gas extraction and groundwater exploitation.The work presented in this paper aimed at investigating the temporal evolution of patterns and processes on a stretch of coast located between Lido di Dante and Lido di Classe, including the mouth of the Bevano river near Ravenna (Italy), using remotely sensed datasets. An innovative integration of remote sensing and monitoring method (Permanent Scatter Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar PSInSAR, Small BAeline Subset - SBAS and Empirical Orthogonal Function - EOF analysis of 20 years of Landsat) has been used to study the temporal evolution of subsidence and its correlation with natural and anthropogenic causes. Results show an increase of the subsidence rates obtained for the last decade: the amount of subsidence due only to natural causes is typically a few millimetres per year, while the man-induced subsidence reaches values of several millimetres per years. Marshlands reclamation, groundwater pumping for agricultural and industrial purposes and methane extraction from gas fields near the coastline are the principal anthropogenic causes. Subsidence in combination with sea level rise will get worse inundation risk from the rivers and widens the coastal areas affected by storm surges and tidal inundation. This makes subsidence an insidious threat having significant cumulative effects on flood risk or the integrity of water defenses and infrastructure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These maps feed machinery with variable rate technology to apply the correct amount of products in the right time and place, to improve farm profitability. One of the most relevant information to estimate the farm yield is the Leaf Area Index. Traditionally, this index can be obtained from manual measurements or from aerial imagery: the former is time consuming and the latter requires the use of drones or aerial services. This work presents an optical sensing-based hardware module that can be attached to existing autonomous or guided terrestrial vehicles. During the normal operation, the module collects periodic geo-referenced monocular images and laser data. With that data a suggested processing pipeline, based on open-source software and composed by Structure from Motion, Multi-View Stereo and point cloud registration stages, can extract Leaf Area Index and other crop-related features. Additionally, in this work, a benchmark of software tools is made. The hardware module and pipeline were validated considering real data acquired in two vineyards-Portugal and Italy. A dataset with sensory data collected by the module was made publicly available.

The demand of cost-effective and rapid tools promoting long-term strategies for cultural heritage promotion and risk assessment is, therefore, urgent. These issues become indeed of paramount importance in the case of very large areas, such as the coastal ones, where the landscape morphoevolution - driven by climate changes - and the landscape modification - due to agricultural and industrial activities - have dramatically increased the exposure risk of Cultural Heritage. In such a framework, traditional monitoring methodologies appear impracticable. This is the reason why the MeTIBas (Italian acronym for Innovative Methods and Technologies for the Cultural Heritage in the Basilicata region) project has been developed. MeTIBas aims to develop an innovative geoarchaeological investigation approach for large areas (implementation of a Territorial Information System, drawing-up of an experimental digital geoarchaeological map, and creation of an open geoarchaeological database). MeTIBas has been developed in the coastal area of Metaponto, which roughly coincides with the ancient territory of the Greek settlement of Metapontum and its chora and includes a region of about 400 km(2) in the Ionian sector of the Basilicata region (southern Italy). The data integration and joint analysis of the huge amount of MeTIBas heterogeneous data have been conveniently carried out in a GIS environment, thus allowing an effective combination of the information from different cognitive levels.

10.3168/jds.2019-18009,Milk somatic cell count and its relationship with milk yield and quality traits in Italian water buffaloes,"Costa, A.; Neglia, G.; Campanile, G.; de Marchi, M.",2020,"In Southern Italy, buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) milk is mostly intended for the manufacture of Mozzarella di Bufala Campana Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) cheese. Despite the economic boost of the last 2 decades, the buffalo farming system should be improved to maximize the efficiency of the dairy industry, improve yield and quality of milk and cheese, and work toward better animal welfare. Milk somatic cell count (SCC) is used worldwide as an indicator of udder health in individual milk and is useful for monitoring farm hygiene in bulk milk. Mastitis data are currently not available on a large scale in Italy; thus, SCC is essential for identifying animals with suspected udder infection and inflammation. Moreover, high milk SCC is associated with altered composition and acidity, and poor technological properties of milk. However, payment systems of the PDO area are based simply on the delivered volume of milk rather than on quality characteristics. Hence, currently there are no penalties for elevated SCC in bulk milk in the Italian buffalo dairy industry. In addition, SCC for buffalo milk is not mentioned by either the European Community regulations or the PDO protocol, evidencing a lack of rules for the maximum SCC limit. To provide a phenotypic characterization of SCC at the population level and to improve knowledge on buffalo milk quality, 876,299 test-day records of 70,156 buffaloes reared in the PDO area were analyzed. Data revealed that around 11% of herd-test-dates (>= 5 animals sampled each) showed average milk SCC >= 400,000 cells/mL (i.e., above the threshold fixed by the European Community for bovine milk). This suggests that there is room to improve SCC at both the farm and individual level. Within first parity, more than 28 and 15% of lactations had average SCC >= 200,000 and >= 300,000 cells/mL, respectively. Both percentages increased with parity and were 39 and 25% in sixth parity, respectively. Supporting this, the proportion of lactations with average SCC >= 500,000 cells/mL increased from 6% in first parity to 12% in sixth parity. Milk yield and SCC were negatively correlated with each other, especially when SCC level was high. An ANOVA was carried out on test-day record milk yield and composition traits, with fixed effects of parity, lactation stage, class of somatic cell score (n = 6), month of calving, and their interactions; buffalo, herd-test-date, and residual were considered random effects. Significantly lower milk yield and lactose percentage were estimated in progressively higher classes of somatic cell score, whereas no significant differences were observed for fat and protein percentages. This is the first attempt to investigate milk SCC in a large data set of Italian dairy buffaloes. These findings may be helpful for defining reliable and effective SCC thresholds to be adopted whenever specific penalties for high SCC are included in milk payment systems. Finally, these results could be used in mastitis monitoring plans aiming to reduce SCC and udder issues at both the individual and farm levels in the Italian buffalo population.",no,"The dataset covers the PDO area for Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, which is a specific region in Southern Italy, not the entire country.",

Nonetheless, the way in which these adaptations take place is still poorly understood. In the present study we applied photo-identification techniques to investigate the social structure of the common bottlenose dolphin population inhabiting the Gulf of Alghero (Sardinia, Italy), analysing data recorded from 2008 to 2019. The social structure analysis showed a division of the entire population into five different communities and the presence of non-random associations, while there was no evidence of segregation between sexes. Furthermore, results highlighted an important change in social structure through time, likely due to a reduction in fish farm activity since 2015. The division of the population into different communities, the presence of segregation based on the foraging strategy (inside or outside the fish farm area) and the social network measures were evaluated by analysing independently the two datasets: the intense and low farm activity periods: 2008-2014 and 2015-2020, respectively. Segregation among individuals belonging to the same foraging strategy class was found only in the earlier period, and the composition of the four communities was consistent with this result.

Spatio-temporal diffusion data were mined from available datasets, and patterns of diffusion were uncovered through an exploratory data analysis.

Aim of this study was to investigate mortality rate in 45 intensive beef cattle farms located in North-Eastern Italy from 2010 to 2013 and to evaluate potential risk factors affecting it. Information from the Italian National Cattle Movement database, as source of mortality data, were crossed with descriptors of barn features and farm management gathered by an on-farm survey to identify factors influencing mortality at farm level, which could be of direct utility for the farmers to reduce cattle losses. Results showed an overall average mortality rate in the 4-year period of 1.4% ranging from 0% to 5.3%. Mortality occurred within the first half of the finishing period, on average 3.4 months after the arrival at the fattening unit. A multivariate regression model showed that mortality was affected by breed (P=0.020) and by floor type as trend (P=0.083). Pure Charolaise (Odds ratio=1.70, 95% Confidence interval=1.11-2.59; P < 0.005) and Limousine breeds (Odds ratio=1.96, 95% Confidence interval= 1.26-3.05; P < 0.005) showed higher odds for mortality compared to other beef breeds or crosses. Bulls housed on fully slatted floor showed higher odds compared to those on deep litter (Odds ratio=1.45, 95% Confidence interval= 1.01-2.08; P< 0.005). Season at arrival affected mortality (P=0.013), with summer (Odds ratio= 1.45, 95% Confidence interval=1.14-1.84; P< 0.005) and autumn (Odds ratio= 1.74, 95% Confidence interval= 1.27-2.38; P< 0.005) being the most critical seasons. Differently from expected, space allowance and barn features such as presence/absence of roof insulation and/or ventilation devices as well as the managerial choice of separating or not newly arrived bulls in a dedicated receiving area for quarantine did not affect mortality. Based on findings from this study, it could be concluded that the avoidance of rearing specialized French beef breeds, of using fully slatted floor and of importing young cattle during warm seasons could be considered as preventive measures to reduce the risk of mortality in intensive beef cattle farms.

The purpose of this paper is to illustrate some results of comparative studies based on regional and national data sets of land use indicators. Further considerations of land use change (LUC) assessment and its effect on environmental policies extended to the whole metropolitan area of Milan are outlined.Design/methodology/approach - The adopted methodology collects different types of information from the existent databases on land uses/land covers (national/regional) and presents an assessment between the selected case of studies (urban regions), leading a shift from a quantitative evaluation to a qualitative one. A comparative study was conducted applying a geographical and statistical difference of land uses among different time thresholds. Subsequently, a cross-tabulation analysis allows an in-depth LUC analysis for the Milan urban region.Findings - The results of the study display an autonomous pattern for the Milan urban region, which is the most densely populated area in Italy and seems to be the only comparable to other international cases of studies due to its extension and characteristics. Nevertheless, it is not the urban region that is affected by the highest rate of land take, which takes place in the Italian context where densities of settlements are lower and sprawled. According to Soja's (2011) interpretation, the post-metropolitan condition of Milan seems to be proved.Originality/value - The study was aimed at creating the first online National Atlas which has been used to overcome traditional problems of homogenization of LUC data in Italy.

Electrical conductivity (EC) and total somatic cell count (SCC) are well-known indirect indicators of mastitis. Differential somatic cell count (DSCC), which represents the proportion of neutrophils and lymphocytes on the total SCC, is instead a novel phenotype collected in the dairy cattle sector in the last lustrum. As little is known about this novel trait in dairy buffalo, in the present study we explored the nongenetic factors affecting DSCC, as well as EC and total somatic cell score (SCS), in the Italian Mediterranean buffalo. The data set used for the analysis included 14,571 test-day (TD) records of 1,501 animals from 6 herds, and climatic information of the sampling locations. The original data were filtered to exclude animals with less than 3 TD per lactation and, for the investigated traits, outliers beyond 4 standard deviations. In the statistical model we included the fixed effects of herd (6 classes), days in milk (DIM; 10 classes of 30 d, with the last being an open class until 360 d), parity (6 classes, from 1 to 6+), year-season of calving (11 classes, from summer 2019 to winter 2021/2022), year-season of sampling (9 classes, from spring 2020 to spring 2022), production level (4 classes based on quartiles of average milk yield by herd), and temperature-humidity index (THI; 4 classes based on quartiles, calculated using the average temperature and relative humidity of the 5 d before sampling). Average EC, SCS, and DSCC vary across herds. Considering DIM, greater EC values were observed at the beginning and the end of lactation; SCS was slightly lower, but DSCC was greater around the lactation peak. Increased EC, SCS, and DSCC levels with increasing parity were reported. Year-season calving and year-season sampling only slightly affected the variation of the investigated traits. Milk of high-producing buffaloes was characterized by lower EC and SCS mean values, nevertheless it had slightly greater DSCC percentages. Buffaloes grouped in the highest THI classes (classes 3 and 4) showed, on average, greater EC, SCS, and DSCC in comparison to the lower classes, especially to class 2.

Despite some publicity, there are relatively few publications on this topic in Ukrainian scientific journals. In contrast, English -language publications cover geographical indications, gastronomic, and wine tourism much more extensively both thematically and territorially. The research relies on periodicals of relevant international organizations, public associations, etc. Analysis of the World Intellectual Property Organization's annual reports revealed that over 90% of the world's geographical indications in recent years fall into the categories of << wines and spirits >> and << agricultural products and food >>. Regarding Italy, statistical data from the World Tourism Organization confirmed its stable position in global tourism (fifth place in tourist arrivals and receipts for the last decade or more) and a surplus growth in the tourism balance (19 billion USD in 2019), leading the UN WTO to characterize it as a << country of powerful growth >>. Recent publications from the World Tourism Organization noted significant recovery rates of international tourism in Italy in the post -pandemic period. According to Coldiretti, the national confederation of agricultural, fishing, agri-food, and environmental sectors in Italy, the projected contribution to the country's economy in 2023 exceeds 30 billion euros from national and foreign tourists who increasingly choose to vacation in rural areas. This trend is attributed to Italy's leadership in gastronomic and wine tourism, with over 5,000 traditional product names and 838 products and wines protected by geographical indications (as of 2023, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry of Italy), as well as the immense potential of agrotourism. The article also highlights the significant role played by the representation of Italy's unique agro-landscapes as cultural landscapes of UNESCO World Heritage, FAO World Agricultural Heritage (GIAHS project), etc., in the development of rural communities. The analysis and overview of the current implementation of the system of geographical indications and guaranteed traditional features in Ukraine allowed for identifying certain strategic directions for applying Italian experience in Ukrainian territories.",no,"The abstract describes a review article that analyzes data from various sources (bibliographic databases, international organizations, national confederations). It does not use or produce a specific, primary dataset with exclusively Italian coverage.",
