In the context of precision irrigation, aimed at increasing water and energy productivity at the farm scale by operating a spatial and temporal variable-rate irrigation if needed, agro-hydrological models play a crucial role. In this study, remote-sensed phenometrics and biophysical crop parameters, and delineation of homogeneous management zones through an electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor, were used to parametrize a semi-distributed mechanistic agro-hydrological model in the case of a 300-ha maize farm located in Brescia (northern Italy). The modelling system was applied to simulate irrigation use in the current situation and in the case of an optimized and variable rate irrigation management. Average results for the period 2016–2020 showed a water and energy saving of about 20% in the case of the optimized irrigation management, confirmed by savings achieved in a pilot pivot in which the modelling procedure was used in 2021 to support the irrigation scheduling in combination with 7-days weather forecast data.","","978-1-6654-6998-2","10.1109/MetroAgriFor55389.2022.9964911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9964911","precision irrigation;pivot;agro-hydrological model;remotely-sensed phenometrics;geophysical soil data","Irrigation;Biological system modeling;Electromagnetic interference;Crops;Distributed databases;Weather forecasting;Soil","","4","","17","IEEE","7 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this model, the soil erodibility factor $K$ accounts for the susceptibility of the soil to be eroded due to the detachment and transport processes operated by the erosive agents. According to the USLE scheme, the $K$ factor should be measured on unit plots, i.e., bare plots of given length (22 m) and steepness (9%) tilled along the maximum slope direction, but there is little evidence that there ever existed an actual unit plot between the plots used to develop the USLE. Given the difficulty in collecting sufficient data to adequately measure $K$., the nomograph method was early developed to allow estimation of $K$ based on standard soil properties. First, in this investigation the soil erodibility factor was experimentally determined for the clay soil of the Sparacia (Sicily) experimental station, based on the available measurements collected in two unit plots. Although a limited database was available for this analysis, a very low value (0.0038 t ha h ha−1 MJ−1 mm−1) was determined, which was an order of magnitude lower than the nomograph value. Then, the values of the plot steepness factor $S$ were determined using soil loss measurements collected on plots varying in steepness from 9 to 26% and resulted higher than the estimated values by a well-known literature expression. Finally, the plot length factor $L$ resulted independent of the plot length and equal to one. The former result was explained by the different flow transport capacity in the unit plot and plot with increased steepness, while the result of a constant length factor was supported by other experimental investigations.","","978-1-6654-6998-2","10.1109/MetroAgriFor55389.2022.9964826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9964826","soil loss;plot measurements;unit plot;USLE","Soil measurements;Databases;Area measurement;Estimation;Soil;Length measurement;Water conservation","","2","","31","IEEE","7 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this aim, new and more reliable methods for vineyard monitoring purposes must be defined. The introduction of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) airborne sensors makes available a considerable amount of data with very high resolution, in terms of both spatial and temporal dimension. In this work, a data fusion approach for vigour characterization in vineyards is presented, which exploits the information provided by 2D multispectral aerial imagery, 3D point cloud crop models and aerial thermal imagery. A crucial phase of the procedure is the proper management of data provided by several sources, to achieve high consistency of the obtained huge dataset. The enhanced effectiveness of the proposed method to classify vines in different vigour classes exploiting multi source data was proved by an experimental campaign, considering 30 portions of vine rows, each made by 8 vines. Results showed that the error of the discriminant analysis using data fusion reach an improvement ranging from 67% to 90% with respect to a single data source, with a misclassification error rate of 3%.","","978-1-7281-3611-0","10.1109/MetroAgriFor.2019.8909219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8909219","Precision viticulture;Crop modelling;2D and 3D data fusion;UAV remote sensing","Three-dimensional displays;Agriculture;Solid modeling;Error analysis;Data models;Two dimensional displays;Data integration","","31","","33","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, computational capacity in real-world settings may be limited. This work examines how accurate, computationally efficient real-time plant detection can be achieved on the large and varied benchmarking Open Plant Phenotyping Database, by building upon the State-of-the-Art (SoA) Scaled YOLO v4 real-time object detection model. The effect of pre-processing, namely cropping unnecessary information and increasing contrast, is examined and experimentally shown to improve both accuracy and efficiency. Transfer learning is also leveraged for the deployment of Scaled YOLO v4, using pre-trained weights from the MS COCO data set, and shown to lead to a moderate improvement in accuracy. The proposed final model results in approximately 10% higher accuracy than the existing baseline model, on a representative subset of about half of images in the Open Plant Phenotyping Database. Experiments show that plant detection accuracy is improved for most well represented samples, with errors appearing in particularly challenging cases or caused by data imbalance. This shows the proposed method has significant potential for highly accurate and computationally efficient plant detection in real-world environments.","","978-1-6654-0533-1","10.1109/MetroAgriFor52389.2021.9628717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9628717","precision farming;object detection;transfer learning;YOLO;plant classification","Databases;Computational modeling;Plants (biology);Transfer learning;Object detection;Benchmark testing;Data models","","2","","18","IEEE","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, challenges such as missing data due to low network connectivity in farming areas and inefficiencies due to resource overuse during field operations still persist. This paper addresses these critical issues by presenting and implementing a comprehensive data collection mechanism using IoT architecture and sensors installed on farm machinery, capturing key metrics in real-time using serverless cloud technology. This data helps optimize field coverage and minimize redundant work. We further address the issue of missing data incorporating artificial intelligence-based Bidirectional Recurrent Imputation for Time Series (BRITS) model. When considering random missing data, the model successfully imputes the data evaluated at a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.4228 m, Mean Square Error (MSE) of $0.4374\ \mathrm{m}^{2}$, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.6614 m, and Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 0.1063.

This work assesses several remotely-sensed ET datasets at high, medium and coarse scale through a comparison with eddy covariance (EC) measurements. In particular, daily retrievals obtained from the Sen-ET model and the ECOSTRESS ET product, both having resolutions of tens of meters, were considered. In addition, 3-km daily ET estimates derived from SEVIRI were analyzed, together with 8-day MODIS ET composites at 500-m spatial resolution. The remotely-sensed actual ET retrievals at medium and coarse scale were compared with EC observations at five forest and grassland sites over different climate zones in Italy. Additionally, for one of these sites (Monte Bondone), the high-resolution ET estimates within the EC footprint were also evaluated. Sen-ET retrievals demonstrated a remarkable ability to describe EC latent heat fluxes (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient, R, equal to 0.83, and unbiased root-mean-square-difference, ubRMSD, equal to 0.85 mm/day), and therefore great potential for producing high-resolution ET estimates, while ECOSTRESS data were less performant (e.g., R = 0.46, and $\boldsymbol{ubRMSD}=1.65\boldsymbol{mm}/\text{day})$. Despite the spatial differences between EC footprint size and the medium along with coarse scale of remotely-sensed datasets, the latter both showed a good agreement with the measured EC fluxes. The SEVIRI ET, in particular, proved to be significantly suitable for the ET description also at a local scale (at daily time step, average R = 0.84, and average $\boldsymbol{u b R M S D=\mathbf0. 8 3}$ mm/day over the study sites), despite a tendency to underestimate in-situ measurements (negative biases ranging between 0.2 and 0.85 mm/day were observed). This study contributes to the topic of evaluating specific remotely-sensed ET datasets under different conditions. The obtained results generally confirm the value of satellite-derived retrievals for ET estimate and monitoring, as well as their potential to improve ET modeling.","","978-1-6654-6998-2","10.1109/MetroAgriFor55389.2022.9964755","National Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9964755","Actual evapotranspiration;remote sensing;eddy covariance;multi-scale dataset evaluation","Atmospheric measurements;Time series analysis;Forestry;Vegetation;Particle measurements;Time measurement;Spatial resolution","","5","","15","IEEE","7 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In light of these problems, we introduce blockchain technology which is a cutting-edge technology in digital finance and has developed rapidly. This paper proposes a data management system based on blockchain technology and affords efficient data extraction, management and access control for heterogeneous forms of data across the agricultural supply chain. The data management system includes four credible data management platforms: agricultural production information, recording transportation information, farmer-consumer transaction information, and consumer credit information. It also can add more platforms according to later needs and combine an interstellar distributed file system and smart contract technology, making it possible to conduct information security research throughout the agricultural supply chain. The proposed system effectively protects information about supply chain activities including agricultural product production, warehousing, transportation, distribution, and sales. It implements seamless connection between agricultural product production and marketing, enabling the transforming and upgrading of agriculture, thereby helping farmers increase their income and eliminate poverty.","2375-9259","978-1-7281-9012-9","10.1109/ICDMW51313.2020.00130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9346341","Data management;Agricultural supply chain;Blockchain;Smart contract;Data extraction;Data access","File systems;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Transportation;Production;Blockchain;Data mining","","13","","20","IEEE","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of Big Data in farming requires the collection and analysis of data from various sources such as sensors, satellites, and farmer surveys. While Big Data can provide the farming community with valuable insights and improve efficiency, there is significant concern regarding the security of this data as well as the privacy of the participants. Privacy regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU Code of Conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement, and the proposed EU AI law, have been created to address the issue of data privacy and provide specific guidelines on when and how data can be shared between organizations. To make confidential agricultural data widely available for Big Data analysis without violating the privacy of the data subjects, we consider privacy-preserving methods of data sharing in agriculture. Synthetic data that retains the statistical properties of the original data but does not include actual individuals’ information provides a suitable alternative to sharing sensitive datasets. Deep learning-based synthetic data generation has been proposed for privacy-preserving data sharing. However, there is a lack of compliance with documented data privacy policies in such privacy-preserving efforts. In this study, we propose a novel framework for enforcing privacy policy rules in privacy-preserving data generation algorithms. We explore several available agricultural codes of conduct, extract knowledge related to the privacy constraints in data, and use the extracted knowledge to define privacy bounds in a privacy-preserving generative model. We use our framework to generate synthetic agricultural data and present experimental results that demonstrate the utility of the synthetic dataset in downstream tasks. We also show that our framework can evade potential threats, such as re-identification and linkage issues, and secure data based on applicable regulatory policy rules.","","979-8-3503-2445-7","10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10386276","Data Privacy;Privacy Policy;Privacy Attacks;Big data in Agriculture","Surveys;Data privacy;Codes;Big Data;Agriculture;General Data Protection Regulation;Task analysis","","10","","48","IEEE","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hyperspectral imaging is an advanced technique used to capture and analyze a wide range of light wavelengths (or spectral bands) across the electromagnetic spectrum. Hyperspectral imaging in soil research involves the use of this advanced imaging technique to analyze the spectral properties of soils. It allows researchers to capture detailed information about the composition, texture, and conditions of soil across a wide range of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. This in-depth spectral analysis provides valuable insights for studying soil health, nutrient content, moisture levels, and other critical parameters. However, existing hyperspectral analysis of soil relies on using imaging systems to exclusively capture information from the soil surface. This yields a two-dimensional image in which each pixel represents a spectrum vector. In this paper, we provide a new 3D hyperspectral data capturing features deep into the soil where each voxel represents a spectrum vector. For effective analysis of this type of new hyperspectral data, we develop a 3D visualization tool to not only directly visualize individual spectrum of the soil volume but also provide a way to cluster such high dimensional data leveraging a deep learning-based method through autoencoder.","","979-8-3503-2445-7","10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386924","United States Department of Agriculture; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10386924","hyperspectral;3D visualization;soil;deep learning;clustering","Three-dimensional displays;Surface waves;Soil measurements;Pipelines;Data visualization;Imaging;Soil","","","","44","IEEE","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, this issue is of great importance in the development of monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems as part of climate change mitigation measures affecting the agricultural sector. In this context, the present study aims to investigate the reliability of visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy as a fast method to determine and monitor the SOC content in an MRV system framework. To that aim, soils from a Long-term field experiment (LTE), located in northern Italy and comparing various maize-based forage systems with contrasting residues and fertilization management was used as a case study. Three sampling campaigns (i.e. 2003, 2012, and 2018) were utilized for a total of 162 soil samples collected in the LTE (54 each). Soil samples archived after each campaign were retrieved and scanned using a Vis-NIR spectrometer to create a site-specific soil spectral library (Site-SSL). Aiming to implement a local prediction model, the 54 soil samples and spectra collected in 2003 were used as a training data set to estimate the SOC of the soil samples collected in 2012 and 2018 (108 in total). In practice, 2003 soil survey represented the time zero reference system. Concurrently, a second prediction model was performed from a regional soil sample archive (Reg-SSL). This is a dataset containing 122 soil samples and spectra collected in alluvial soils from the Po Plain, in the same pedo-landscape of the LTE. The Reg-SSL was merged with the 2003 Site-SSL to implement a regional prediction model. The objective of this activity was to compare the SOC estimations for 2012 and 2018 obtained with both Site-SSL and Reg-SSL models. In addition, three strategies were compared, including Random Forest (RF), Cubist (CU), and Memory based learning (MBL) on Site-SSL and Reg-SSL models (totally, six models were created). We also carried out a sensitivity analysis about the influence of training sample size on the accuracy of different models. Results revealed high correlations between measured and predicted values and for this kind of application, the best results were identified for the MBL model and the Site-SSL dataset. This exercise pointed out that Vis-NIR spectral libraries could be used for detecting changes in SOC. In addition, comparing the use of regional and site-specific libraries for SOC estimation, we confirmed that the accuracy of the Reg-SSL model, although more stable, was lower than that of Site-SSL. A sample size of N=40 samples resulted large enough for building a site-specific spectral library.","","979-8-3503-1272-0","10.1109/MetroAgriFor58484.2023.10424077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10424077","Vis-NIR spectroscopy;Soil spectral library;Soil organic carbon;data mining;Memory-based learning","Climate change;Soil measurements;Organic compounds;Carbon;Memory management;Learning systems;Fertilizers;Data mining;Spectroscopy;Environmental monitoring;Agricultural products;Sustainable development;Predictive models;Data models;Infrared imaging;Sampling methods;Estimation theory;Training data","","1","","27","IEEE","12 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, an attempt has been made to analyze land use/land cover changes (LULCC) in Italy between the years 2000 and 2018 using Copernicus CORINE Land Cover (CLC) datasets of corresponding years. In addition, the Cellular Automata Markov model has been employed to predict the LULC of Italy for the year 2050. The CLC datasets were reclassified into 8 major land cover/use classes: built-up, agriculture, forests, natural vegetation, bare land, water bodies, ice/snow, and wet-land. Resultant LULCC detection maps indicate a significant increase in bare land by 36.4 % in the period 2000–2018 and, according to the prediction, a further increase by 46.7 % in the period 2018–2050 will be experienced. Built-up increased by 14.7 % between 2000–2018 and 19.8 % between 2018–2050. Significant decreases in natural vegetation and ice/snow in the period 2000–2018 have been quantified in 18.9 % and 6.5 %, respectively. According to the present prediction, those classes will further decrease in the period 2018–2050 to 24.5 % and 7.1 %, respectively. To validate the quality of the present research, an accuracy assessment of the reclassified maps of the years 2000 and 2018 has been carried out. The accuracy assessment involves comparing classified maps with the ground truth image through 576 randomly selected samples. Reclassified maps of 2000 and 2018 showed an overall accuracy of 89.9 % and 89.6 % with a Kappa index of 0.884 and 0.880, respectively.

In particular, we describe a deep learning based method to allow a robot to perform an accurate weed/crop classification using a sequence of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to RGB images. The first network, based on an encoder-decoder segmentation architecture, performs a pixelwise, plant-type agnostic, segmentation between vegetation and soil that enables to extract a set of connected blobs representing plant instances. We show that such network can be trained also using external, ready to use pixel-wise labeled data sets coming from different contexts. Each plant is hence classified between crop and weeds by using the second network. Quantitative experimental results, obtained on real world data, demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve good classification results also on challenging images.","","978-1-5386-9245-5","10.1109/IRC.2019.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8675654","precision agriculture;robot vision;deep learning;crop weed classification","Agriculture;Image segmentation;Robots;Vegetation mapping;Soil;Training;Feature extraction","","78","1","22","IEEE","28 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Plantation type and its distribution over the watershed scale with considerable heterogeneity can alter the rainfall path into a runoff by modifying the soil hydrological processes, such as interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration, interflow, surface runoff, baseflow, and groundwater recharge. Therefore, in-situ measurement and monitoring of these parameters for the plantations may greatly help in watershed management and develop a more efficient hydrological model. Besides, the existence of an individual plantation alters with land management practices influences soil properties like hydraulic conductivity, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), nitrogen content and organic carbon content. This study analyses the impact of fully grown plantation crops (horticultural and forestry) on various critical hydrological processes and soil properties. A long-term (2017-19) and intensive measurements were carried out at watershed scale through controlled field experiments under nine different plantations crops. The ANOVA based statistical analysis using the collected long-term dataset shows that variations in soil properties were statistically insignificant (at a 5% significance level) with in plantation type. However, a significant variation was found (at a 5% significance level) in soil properties of various watersheds covering different plantations. In addition to the soil properties, the influence of different plantations cover is also visible in the critical hydrological process. The results indicated that throughfall (TF) of plantations is inversely proportional to LAI, and it ranged from 54 % to 82 %, stem flow from 1.1%-7.7%, interception loss from 16%-42% of total rainfall. Runoff coefficient (Rc) varied 0.17 to 0.24 under different plantations. Mean available soil moisture in 10 cm to 140 cm soil depth varies between 10 % and 25 % among plantations during 2017. The runoff, sediment yield, and groundwater depletion were also estimated and analysed. Understanding the variation in these hydrological processes under different plantations could help in improving the estimation of the hydrological parameters.","","978-1-6654-0533-1","10.1109/MetroAgriFor52389.2021.9628825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9628825","Throughfall;Interception;runoff;tree plantations;soil physical and hydrological properties","Soil measurements;Soil properties;Soil moisture;Crops;Forestry;Conductivity;Sediments","","","","16","IEEE","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Irrigation plays an essential role in the grade and productivity of harvests, while also being a crucial factor in the cost-effectiveness of food production. Smart irrigation uses technology to improve watering, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) applications and Machine Learning algorithms. The correct functioning of irrigation nozzles is critical to ensure that the hydration plan is deployed correctly to the crop field. This paper presents a Machine Learning algorithm that can automatically recognize water from aerial footage of irrigation systems. This automatic recognition can help in the irrigation system inspection, potentially reducing time and cost in system maintenance. Initial results show that it is possible to identify water on image frames captured by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using the Mask R-CNN Neural Network. The goal is to identify malfunctioning irrigation systems that can lead to under or overwatering, compromising the irrigation plan's correct implementation.","","978-1-7281-8783-9","10.1109/MetroAgriFor50201.2020.9277542","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277542","Smart Irrigation;Deep Learning;Mask R-CNN;System Inspection;UAV imaging","Irrigation;Videos;Training;Agriculture;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Neural networks;Water resources","","20","","22","IEEE","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a Living Lab approach, stakeholders collaborated to design an FMIS prototype and assess its suitability to address the specific issues of this sector. This tool supports agricultural operations and improves data-driven decision-making, embedding functionality for herd management, veterinary assistance, livestock performance monitoring and agronomic support. The use case methodology led to defining goals for improving farm-level operations and supervising the supply chain, leveraging secure data collection, integration and sharing between stakeholders. Challenges include cultural resistance to innovation, data privacy concerns, and technical and economic barriers. Opportunities include operational advantages, technology appeal, market demands for product traceability, and institutional support for digitalisation.

Since a sustainable reuse of AW depends on their availability and geographical location, a methodology was put forward to locate and quantify the wastes considered in this research study i.e., plastic films used for protected crops and sheep wool. By using a Geographical Information System (GIS), land use analysis was carried out in an area with the highest concentration of protected crops in Italy (Ragusa province). A suitable index for computing Agricultural Plastic Wastes (APW) was chosen from literature. Furthermore, by using data supplied by National Zootechnical Registry, a dedicated GIS model was developed to localize and quantify sheep and breeder’s sheep in Sicily.

The use of agrivoltaics is conditioned by several factors, among which the first to consider is land suitability. This research investigates the potential of agrivoltaics in the Lazio Region to address the demand for clean and sustainable energy. The considered agrivoltaic system is one that is raised above the ground according to the standards of the most recent Italian legislation. This study examined two villages, Nepi and Calcata, to illustrate the application possibilities. Nepi has a population (9471 inhabitants) three times larger than the regional average (2429 inhabitants), while Calcata's population is about half the regional average (913 inhabitants). These examples were used to estimate the agrivoltaic energy required to meet the energy demands of hypothetical municipalities with varying population sizes. Suitable agricultural areas for agrivoltaic development were identified using Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis and various datasets, including regional land use and DEMs. The identified areas were analysed for optimal solar aspect, with acceptable values ranging from 135° to 225°. The research estimated energy potential and the energy demands of those areas. Subsequently, the areas to be allocated for agrivoltaics to meet the energy needs of the municipalities were estimated. Only a small fraction of the available agricultural land is needed to meet these demands, suggesting significant potential for agrivoltaic systems in these regions. The findings could advocate for investment in agrivoltaics by both public and private sectors.","","979-8-3503-5544-4","10.1109/MetroAgriFor63043.2024.10948848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10948848","Agrivoltaics;Sustainable energy;GIS;Photovoltaic systems;Renewable energy potential","Photovoltaic systems;Energy consumption;Renewable energy sources;Legislation;Production;Forestry;Metrology;Standards;Geographic information systems;Investment","","","","22","IEEE","11 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spectroscopic measurements for these soil and water samples were collected under stable laboratory conditions using two instruments to cover the full range of wavelength: Ocean Insight HR2000+ (400 to 950nm) and ARCoptix (900 to 2600nm). The objective of this study is to use these spectral reflectance measurements to develop models that can predict both SOC and DOC. Therefore, the raw spectra of 2902 bands were preprocessed to ensure an optimal correlation and noise removal and the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method was applied afterwards with leave-one-out cross-validation approach. The resultant best fit PLSR model has shown a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99 for training and 0.94-0.98 for prediction of SOC and DOC, respectively, for the SOC range of 0.46-3.15% (mean: 1.5%) and DOC range of 0.18-$10,333 \mu \mathrm{g}$ (mean: 1,620 $\mu \mathrm{g}$).

It can affect many visible plant traits such as size and surface area, the number of leaves and their color, etc. In recent years, computer vision-based plant phenomics has emerged as a promising tool for plant research and management. Such techniques have the advantage of being non-destructive, non-evasive, fast, and offer high levels of automation. Pulses like chickpeas play an important role in ensuring food security in poor countries owing to their high protein and nutrition content. In the present work, we have built a dataset comprising of two varieties of chickpea plant shoot images under different moisture stress conditions. Specifically, we propose a BAT optimized ResNet-18 model for classifying stress induced by water deficiency using chickpea shoot images. BAT algorithm identifies the optimal value of the mini-batch size to be used for training rather than employing the traditional manual approach of trial and error. Experimentation on two crop varieties (JG and Pusa) reveals that BAT optimized approach achieves an accuracy of 96% and 91% for JG and Pusa varieties that is better than the traditional method by 4%. The experimental results are also compared with state of the art CNN models like Alexnet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-50.

As various sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) instrumentation become more available, affordable, reliable, and stable, it has become possible to conduct data collection, integration, and analysis at multiple temporal and spatial scales, in real-time, and with high resolutions. At the same time, the sheer amount of data poses a great challenge to data storage and analysis, and the de facto data management and analysis practices adopted by scientists have become increasingly inefficient. Additionally, the data generated from different disciplines, such as genomics, phenomics, environment, agronomy, and socioeconomic, can be highly heterogeneous. That is, datasets across disciplines often do not share the same ontology, modality, or format. All of the above make it necessary to design a new data management infrastructure that implements the principles of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). In this paper, we propose Agriculture Data Management and Analytics (ADMA), which satisfies the FAIR principles. Our new data management infrastructure is intelligent by supporting semantic data management across disciplines, interactive by providing various data management/analysis portals such as web GUI, command line, and API, scalable by utilizing the power of high-performance computing (HPC), extensible by allowing users to load their own data analysis tools, trackable by keeping track of different operations on each file, and open by using a rich set of mature open source technologies.","","979-8-3503-2445-7","10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10386589","Agriculture data management;FAIR principles;Heterogeneous data","Climate change;Technological innovation;Instruments;Sociology;Agriculture;Sensors;Internet of Things","","5","","24","IEEE","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In IoT systems, if data management is entirely performed in the cloud, the system may not work correctly due to connectivity problems, which is common in some remote regions where the agribusiness thrives. A fog computing solution enables the IoT system to process data faster and deal with intermittent connectivity. However, a high number of packets sent from the fog to the cloud can cause link congestion with mostly useless data traffic. Dealing with fog data filtering is a challenge because it requires knowing which data is essential to send to the cloud. This paper proposes an approach to collect and store data in a smart agriculture environment and two different methods filtering data in the fog. We designed an experiment for each filtering method, using a real dataset containing temperature and humidity values. In both experiments, the fog filters the data using the k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) algorithm, which classifies data into categories according to their value ranges. In the first experiment, the fog classifies the data and generates an output of the number of data categories. In the second experiment, data is classified and also compressed based on the previously obtained categories using the runlength encoding (RLE) technique to preserve the data time series nature. Our results show that data filtering reduces the amount of data sent by the fog to the cloud.","","978-1-7281-8783-9","10.1109/MetroAgriFor50201.2020.9277661","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277661","smart agriculture;fog computing;Internet of things;data filtering;machine learning","Agriculture;Cloud computing;Sensors;Humidity;Edge computing;Training;Temperature distribution","","18","","17","IEEE","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Increasing world population and climate change are setting new challenges to food production. Water stress can cause severe damage to crops, and detecting and preventing this threat is crucial. Smart agriculture and the use of sensors directly on the field is a promising and rapidly evolving solution. Data collected by a large number of sensors must be analyzed and efficiently interpreted. In this context, machine learning is an effective solution. This article conducts a comparative analysis of several well-established machine learning models, all trained on a dataset enriched with a novel parameter for the assessment of plant health, the stem electrical impedance (modulus and phase). This feature gives promising results since it is a direct parameter of the plant itself. Moreover, the inclusion of the stem impedance parameter significantly boosted the model's performance, notably enhancing the effectiveness, particularly evident in the case of the top-performing model in this study, the random forest algorithm. When incorporating stem electrical impedance, this model achieved an impressive F1 score of 98%, markedly surpassing the 88% obtained in its absence. As a complementary analysis, a permutation feature performance analysis was conducted, highlighting the potential of stem impedance modulus as a promising feature for evaluating plant watering conditions. The removal of impedance modulus from the training model resulted in an average classification performance loss of 25% in terms of F1 score, suggesting how impedance monitoring is a promising approach for plant health management.","2771-9529","","10.1109/TAFE.2024.3457156","Agritech National Research Center and received funding from the European Union Next-GenerationEU; PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPRESA E RESILIENZA (PNRR) MISSIONE 4 COMPONENTE 2, INVESTIMENTO 1.4 D.D. 1032 17/06/2022, CN00000022; National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP); Mission 4 - Component 2 - Investment 3.1 - Call for tender No. n. 3264 of 28/12/2021 of Italian Ministry of Research; European Union NextGenerationEU; Italian Ministry of Research(grant numbers:CUP: B33C22000710006); iENTRANCE; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10690239","Machine learning;plants monitoring;smart agriculture;stem impedance","Impedance;Machine learning;Data models;Support vector machines;Climate change;Plants (biology);Smart agriculture;Food security;Food products;Threat assessment","","1","","22","IEEE","24 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Assessesment of soil water content is done using low-cost capacitance probe. We first converted the measured voltage unit for each capacitance probe into relative permittivity using 10 standard solutions and developed a physical based model that used relative permittivity, bulk density and particles density to assess soil water content in soil cores. To test the robustness of our design and model, we built 12 data loggers and used 36 probes to assess water content in 36 soil cores that representing 12 soil texture (clayey to sandy). Preliminary results showed that capacitance probe were able to explain 86% of the total variance of soil water content in an independent dataset of 12 soil cores. The analysis of the residuals extracted from the calibration curves developed using standard solutions showed that there was no effect of the device (0% of the variance) on the measurement, but a small effect of the capacitance probe was detected (15%). This effect can be alleviated by the use of calibration curves that are specific to each probe. The low-cost of EVAP-FOR data logger provides the opportunity to develop local high spatial density networks of monitoring stations. Such networks will be useful to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of terrestrial ecosystem productivity and resilience, for example, at watershed scale.","","978-1-7281-3611-0","10.1109/MetroAgriFor.2019.8909264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8909264","Open-source device;soil water content;soil temperature;air temperature;relative humidity;capacitance probe","Soil;Probes;Capacitance;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Permittivity","","","","5","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use these corrected annotations to propose and compare approaches based on State-of-the-Art (SoA) object detection/recognition, namely Faster R-CNN and EfficientNet, with appropriate pre-processing and data augmentation. Pre-processing and augmentation is crucial for achieving accurate results with this dataset, which faces challenges caused by the small size of the objects, occlusions, similarity in appearance and other factors.

Moreover, these methods could yield results that are in some cases inaccurate or lack interpretability. This paper introduces an innovative and effective approach to extract characterising colours from different land types. The proposed solution manages to automatically generate the sets of colours corresponding to categories of land, from a small set of annotated images, in just one iteration.

To evaluate the Smart Farming sub-use cases' overall outcome, each economic and environmental benefits, social aspects, and the technical evolution path were evaluated.

Increasing crop productivity is also important to increase essentials' income, enhance farmer field-level insights, and actionable knowledge to produce when the crop is of the best quality or selling it with a good price. Therefore, in the Smart Farm system proposed in this paper specially in case of big data science, we need to consider data analysis and machine learning as the most important steps and then we can include the value of big data science. Machine learning is an essential ability to learn from data and provide data-driven information, decisions, and forecasts.

In this study, a combined approach based on the use of multispectral imagery, acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, and statistical models was applied for determining the water status of a citrus orchard during different phenological stages, with respect to traditional stem water potential (SWP) measurements. Specifically, the suitability of individual spectral bands and vegetation indices was firstly evaluated, followed by the implementation of statistical methods (i.e., stepwise linear regression models and principal component regression) using the UAV information as explanatory variables. The results showed a weak correlation between the spectral bands and the SWP during the fruit rapid growth stage. A stronger relationship was observed instead when the vegetation indices were used, during the same phenological stage, but with low Pearson coefficients of correlation, varying from -0.31 to -0.46. The SWP estimated by the statistical methods resulted more reliable, with average mean absolute error, root mean square error and percent bias values ranging from 0.17 to 0.19 MPa, from 0.23 to 0.24 MPa and from -0.38 to -0.59%, respectively.

For the Celone river, continuous measurements of streamflow and discrete measurements of SSC taken, from 2010 to 2011, in all hydrological conditions (high, normal and low flow) were used to develop sediment rating curves. In particular, different sediment rating curves were developed for the entire dataset and three subsets of data identified based on the hydrological conditions and loads were computed with and without a back-transformation correction factor. At the Celone river gauge, annual specific sediment load ranged from 2.4 t ha−1 yr−1to 6.06 t ha−1 yr−1. At the Carapelle river gauge, the annual specific sediment load ranged from 0.9 t ha−1yr−1to 7.45 t ha−1 yr−1.

In this paper, temporal-spectral descriptors are derived from sigma nought time series acquired from various Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems over different agro-ecological zones in Senegal, The Gambia, Vietnam. It is shown that: - a limited set of temporal descriptors is sufficient to generate a reliable crop map; - the selection of the appropriate time period is crucial; - the temporal combination of wavelengths and polarizations may enhance the level of detail and product's reliability; - the use of temporal descriptors derived from multi-annual, annual, and seasonal time series data provides, from an agronomic perspectives, complementary information; - temporal-spectral descriptors have an agronomic meaning, hence they should be used in knowledge based classifiers; - by sparse time series the adoption of temporal-spectral descriptors is more effective than a dedicated crop detection algorithm.","2153-7003","978-1-4799-7929-5","10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7325724","Temporal-spectral descriptors;agriculture","Agriculture;Time series analysis;Vegetation mapping;Remote sensing;Synthetic aperture radar;Sensors;Backscatter","","3","","6","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This fact is due to the willing and the necessity to robotize agricultural process so to ease the spread of ""smart agriculture"" approaches and techniques to be more precise in responding to plants, environment, and human needs. Fruit crops sector is one of the most difficult agricultural sectors on which apply robotization because of its high level of complexity both at orchard and tree level. It is recognized that a simplification of the tree and orchard environment will certainly help in automate activity in fruit production so, lately the diffusion of less complex two-dimensional tree shapes is happening. This study wants to evaluate improvement in computer vision application for fruit detection problems, that 2D training systems should bring with them. To the knowledge of the authors this could be the first paper trying to quantify that. In the trial a YOLOv3 neural network was trained on three datasets containing 2D, 3D and mixed apple training system images. Two model specialized on 2D and 3D training system, and one specialized in mixed situation were obtained. These models were then cross evaluated to define their performances in each training system condition (2D, 3D and mixed). In add to that a ground truthing dataset, with a known number of real fruits, was utilized to evaluate which percentage of the real fruit number can be directly detected by the models and how much the different training system affect this capability. Results show that the developed models present generally poor performance for field application with max F1-score of 0.68. For all the model*dataset combination, mixed model resulted always the best, followed by 2D or 3D model when applied to their relative training system. Bests performances were achieved by two models out of three in 2D training system dataset suggesting that this shape improve fruit detection. 2D model performed better than 3D in mixed situation suggesting better training phase done with 2D system images.

Machine learning techniques have demonstrated their potential to provide accurate predictions. However, existing models often rely on a limited number of input variables for crop yield predictions, which makes them only suitable for specific scenarios. In this study, we have developed four distinct machine learning-based predictors, incorporating various climate factors, including daytime temperature, nighttime temperature, precipitation (rainfall), vegetation index, and evapotranspiration as input variables to predict tomato acreage yields in counties of California, USA. Our results show that regression models constructed using neural networks and linear regression exhibited better performance than other predictors, achieving an average accuracy rate of 70% to 80%. Compared to most of the existing crop yield predictors, our models offer versatility while maintaining a desirable level of predictive accuracy. Expanding the number of input variables, such as nitrogen fertilizer usage etc, and introducing larger spatial and temporal high-resolution datasets for model training can improve our model performance, enabling us to obtain better results in tomato yield prediction.","","979-8-3503-2445-7","10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10386285","Climate Variables;Machine Learning;Neural Network;Evapotranspiration;NDVI","Analytical models;Input variables;Production;Predictive models;Data models;Standards;Regression tree analysis","","","","48","IEEE","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pest management is a key issue in the field of agriculture to boost yields and consequently local economy. From a food safety perspective, pest detection and control is certainly significant for producing healthy crops characterized by high-quality, pesticide-free fruits and vegs.

Thus, this research compares between different detection algorithms as it plays the baseline for subsequent tasks of counting, apple grasping and growth monitoring. In this work, four different state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models have been compared for apple detection: Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5, YOLOv8 and RT-DETR. The models were examined for their accuracy in apple detection and their invariance to the background apples. As Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5 are commonly used algorithms in this domain, they were chosen alongside YOLOv8. Furthermore, as the transformer-based detectors like RT-DETR outperform YOLO on large datasets, their comparison for apple detection is also warranted.

In addition, the effect of attention mechanisms in YOLOv8 architecture, hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation were explored. The evaluation showed that RT-DETR outperformed all models for $\mathbf{mAP}_{\mathbf{0.50}:\mathbf{0.95}}$ on the MinneApple and custom dataset for the trained image size.

Traditional methods to detect these insects are cost ineffective, thus, automated vision systems based on machine learning (ML) have recently been proposed in the literature. However, a significant issue is the lack of a prior dataset to build the ML model on. To mitigate this problem, we propose a new approach to train a model using a small initial dataset and continually improve the accuracy process by retraining it on new images labeled by a mobile application. Retraining is performed on new data, which comes from a mobile application that displays pictures of insects and prompts expert users to label them. The users’ input is used to retrain the model on new coming images. Specifically, our method trains the model on 100 initial images, and retrains it with every 100 new images. The IP102 large-scale dataset for pest recognition was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The results show an improvement of accuracy of up to 50 percentage units for the built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.","","979-8-3503-1272-0","10.1109/MetroAgriFor58484.2023.10424407","Teagasc; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10424407","Machine Learning;Image Classification;Pest Detection;Model retraining;Mobile application","Training;Smart agriculture;Insects;Machine learning;Production;Mobile applications;Convolutional neural networks","","","","18","IEEE","12 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its S-shaped form may be useful in describing in simple manner the cumulative volume curves and then the pulverization capabilities of a nozzle. Experimental tests were carried out with an Albuz (France) orange hollow cone nozzle ATR 80 (European color code) at four pressures: 300, 500, 1000, and 1500 kPa. Drop size was measured by exploiting the liquid immersion method in a custom-made test-bench.

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several Digital Agriculture use cases as an example domain that can benefit from HARVEST as data is collected frequently, in large volumes, and for a variety of applications. Our evaluations yield accuracies within 3% compared to fully supervised training using less than 80 labeled samples per class. Furthermore, we show that HARVEST delivers near-linear scaling, reducing the training time from 7.8 hours on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU up to 31 minutes by using DDP on 16 GPUs.

On the other hand, the use of automatic milking robots, milking parlours, collars and pedometers allows for a precise monitoring of dairy cows, providing farmers with real time information. In this context, the early detection of production anomalies is fundamental for animal health and safety. In this work, two numerical methods for detecting daily milk production anomalies are presented and applied to three different farms selected as case studies. The methods described in this paper provide a numerical procedure having the scope of detecting milk yield anomalies. Both the algorithms presented hereinafter are based on statistical calculations and take as input daily resting time and daily milk yield recorded respectively by the pedometers worn by the cows and by the automatic milking system of the barns. The first method take into consideration two indicators, namely the Difference in Relative Production (DRP) and the Daily Rest time (DR). DRP is defined as the relative difference in daily milk yield between real-time data of a single animal and a baseline curve considered as an ideal trend. An anomaly (i.e. a deviation from the normal value) is determined, for a single cow, for a specific day, if two conditions on DRP and DR are contemporary verified. In the second method, starting from the Wood function, maybe the most famous model to fit the production of the cow in dependence of day in milk, the concept of reliability of robust statistics has been introduced in order to obtain, for each animal, a more solid and realistic lactation curve since not affected by outlier values.","","979-8-3503-1272-0","10.1109/MetroAgriFor58484.2023.10424227","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10424227","PLF;Dairy cattle;Big Data;Automatic milking system;Anomaly detection","Training;Dairy products;Animals;Production;Cows;Real-time systems;Agriculture","","","","17","IEEE","12 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Localized weather-based fruit surface temperature (FST) prediction, a key indicator of fruit stress, can help in planning better mitigation strategies and ultimately reduce crop losses. Therefore, this study evaluated localized weather (solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, dew point, and wind speed) and fruit size data driven multiple linear regression (MLR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for predicting apple FST. The models were trained on either the localized in-orchard or open field weather station data collected in the 2022 field season and validated against the actual FST of ‘Honeycrisp’ apple. The MLR model was able to predict FST with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 2. $1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ using the in-orchard weather and fruit size dataset as inputs. The LSTM model prediction average RMSE for the same dataset was 2. $3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Using open field weather data, the RMSE was 2. $69^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and 2. $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for the LSTM and MLR models, respectively. Additionally, both in-orchard and open-field trained models outperformed the existing energy balance FST prediction approach on the same dataset. Overall, these findings can be helpful to growers for real-time and reliable FST monitoring using localized as well as publicly available weather data inputs.","","979-8-3503-1272-0","10.1109/MetroAgriFor58484.2023.10424249","Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10424249","apple;heat stress;fruit surface temperature;machine learning;crop loss mitigation","Temperature distribution;Machine learning;Predictive models;Data models;Real-time systems;Stress;Meteorology","","","","13","IEEE","12 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the resource constraints on such devices like energy (power), memory and computation capability, make the execution of complex operations and AI algorithms (neural network models) for disease detection quite challenging. To this end, compression and quantization techniques offer viable solutions to reduce the memory footprint of neural networks while maximizing performance on the constrained devices.

We present a quantitative analysis of Deep Leaf by comparing five different deep learning models: a 32-bit floating point model, a compressed model, and three different types of quantized models exhibiting differences in terms of accuracy, memory utilization, average inference time, and energy consumption.

Therefore, the reduction of field activities is important to limit monitoring costs. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that the combination of appropriate active learning strategies and regression models can dramatically reduce the field work with negligible degradation of model prediction performance.

Considering the outlook of issues associated with it, we considered the blockchain and AI-based technology to fulfill the purpose of secure land registry. Establishing and confirming land ownership is essential for the land registry system in ensuring the protection of ownership rights, particularly crucial in the contexts of agriculture and Industry 5.0. In these sectors, land serves as a crucial resource for sustainable development and industrial innovation. Most of the existing works rely on legacy and centralized system to store land records; which result in high incidences of forgery and fraud. Therefore, maintaining a robust land registry system is essential to fostering economic investments, promoting green practices, and facilitating equitable access to land resources in agriculture and Industry 5.0 ecosystem. We proposed an AI and blockchain-enabled land registry system for agriculture and industry 5.0 that offers a more reliable, transparent, and efficient solution to the challenges of lack of transparency, data tampering, and inefficiency, which can result in disputes, fraudulent claims, and a lack of trust during the land registry. AI models, such as logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), are employed to classify the fraud and non-fraud land data. Only the non-fraud land data is forwarded into the blockchain network, thereby reducing the computational overhead of the proposed land registry system. In the blockchain network, we designed various smart contracts that validate the land data with unparalleled efficiency and security. Further, the slither solidity source analyzer tool is used for smart contract vulnerability assessment. After the assessment, the smart contract is deployed using the Sepolia test network. The non-fraudulent land data is redirected to the interplanetary file system (IPFS) that stores the original data and forwards the associated hash into the blockchain’s immutable ledger. The entire proposed system is evaluated with different performance parameters, such as AI statistical measures including accuracy, ROC, log-loss score, blockchain scalability comparison, gas cost utilization, and bandwidth utilization. Furthermore, the vulnerability assessment of the smart contract is analyzed using Slither to highlight the working of proposed system without any vulnerabilities. The proposed blockchain and AI-based land registry system ensure a secure and intelligent pipeline to combat against land forgery activities.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3451627","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, through the Researchers Supporting Project(grant numbers:RSPD2024R681); Kore University of Enna, Enna, Italy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10658643","INDEX TERMS Artificial intelligence;machine learning;land registry system;blockchain;Ethereum;Bitcoin;smart contracts","Blockchains;Smart contracts;Artificial intelligence;Agriculture;Fifth Industrial Revolution;Security;Open source software;Machine learning;Bitcoin","","3","","21","CCBYNCND","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we introduce a dataset, so-called DAVIS-Ag, for promoting more extensive research on Domain-inspired Active VISion in Agriculture. To be specific, we leveraged our open-source ""AgML"" framework and 3D plant simulator of ""Helios"" to produce 502K RGB images from 30K densely sampled spatial locations in 632 synthetic orchards. Moreover, plant environments of strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes are considered at two different scales (i.e., Single-Plant and Multi-Plant). Useful labels are also provided for each image, including (1) bounding boxes and (2) instance segmentation masks for all identifiable fruits, and also (3) pointers to other images of the viewpoints that are reachable by an execution of action so as to simulate active viewpoint selections at each time step. Using DAVIS-Ag, we visualize motivating examples where fruit visibility can dramatically change depending on the pose of the camera view primarily due to occlusions by other components, such as leaves. Furthermore, we present several baseline models with experiment results for benchmarking in the task of target visibility maximization. Transferability to real strawberry environments is also investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of using the dataset for prototyping real-world solutions.

Here, we present a method to retrieve surface soil moisture (SSM) from the Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellites, which carry C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (CSAR) sensors that provide the richest freely available SAR data source so far, unprecedented in accuracy and coverage. Our SSM retrieval method, adapting well-established change detection algorithms, builds the first globally deployable soil moisture observation data set with 1-km resolution. This paper provides an algorithm formulation to be operated in data cube architectures and high-performance computing environments. It includes the novel dynamic Gaussian upscaling method for spatial upscaling of SAR imagery, harnessing its field-scale information and successfully mitigating effects from the SAR's high signal complexity. Also, a new regression-based approach for estimating the radar slope is defined, coping with Sentinel-1's inhomogeneity in spatial coverage. We employ the S-1 SSM algorithm on a 3-year S-1 data cube over Italy, obtaining a consistent set of model parameters and product masks, unperturbed by coverage discontinuities. An evaluation of therefrom generated S-1 SSM data, involving a 1-km soil water balance model over Umbria, yields high agreement over plains and agricultural areas, with low agreement over forests and strong topography. While positive biases during the growing season are detected, the excellent capability to capture small-scale soil moisture changes as from rainfall or irrigation is evident.

A key goal of this study is creating a database of nozzle properties. Five stainless steel flat fan nozzles (Tee Jet, USA) were chosen according to the ISO 25358 standard, which defines spray classes according to droplet size spectra from Very Fine (VF) to Ultra Coarse (UC). A hydraulic test bench was employed to replicate spraying conditions precisely under controlled settings. The nozzles were tested at three different distances from the system's field of view (0 cm, ±3.5 cm, and ±7 cm from the nozzle cone's center axis) keeping the pressure conditions as requested by the standard. As expected, the results show that the cumulative volume percentage increases as the droplet diameter increases showing a sigmoidal trend for each nozzle type. The VF/ F nozzle produced the smallest droplets, with Dv10, Dv50, and Dv90 values of $\mathbf{68.2}\ \boldsymbol{\mu} \mathbf{m}, \mathbf{137.64}\ \boldsymbol{\mu} \mathbf{m}$, and 194.68 $\boldsymbol{\mu}\mathbf{m}$ respectively. Conversely, the VC/UC nozzle generated the largest droplets, with Dv10, Dv50, and Dv90 values of 138.46 $\boldsymbol{\mu}\mathbf{m}, \mathbf{399.42}\ \boldsymbol{\mu}\mathbf{m}$, and $\mathbf{724.04}\ \boldsymbol{\mu}\mathbf{m}$. The variability in droplet size distributions was evident from the distribution of droplet sizes, emphasizing the significance of nozzle selection in minimizing spray drift.

Nevertheless, detecting inundated vegetation and urban areas still represents a critical issue, because the radar signatures of these targets are often ambiguous. This paper analyzes the role of the interferometric coherence in complementing intensity SAR data for mapping floods in agricultural and urban environments. The advantages of the joint use of intensity and coherence are first discussed in a theoretical way and then verified on a case study, namely, the flood that hit the Emilia-Romagna region (Northern Italy) in January 2014. The short revisit time of the COSMO-SkyMed images, as well as a dedicated acquisition plan tailored to the requirements of the Italian Civil Protection Department, has allowed us to build a data set of radar interferometric observations of the event. Results show that the analysis of the multitemporal trend of the coherence is useful for the interpretation of SAR data since it enables a considerable reduction of classification errors that could be committed considering intensity data only. Interferometric data have permitted us to distinguish zones where water receded from areas where it persisted for a longer time and, in one case, to measure changes of water level.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2482001","Italian Space Agency (ASI); EO-based CHange detection for Operational Flood Management Project; National Research Fund of Luxembourg; PAPARAZZI(grant numbers:CORE C11/SR/1277979); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299665","Coherence;COSMO-SkyMed (CSK);floods;interferometry;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);Coherence;COSMO-SkyMed (CSK);floods;interferometry;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Vegetation mapping;Coherence;Synthetic aperture radar;Soil;Backscatter;Urban areas","","165","","36","IEEE","16 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hydrological model generates a water balance and the resulting value indicates the amount of available water in a given area. The calculation of the water balance is fundamental for the development of new strategies for the management of water resources. One of its main adversities is the estimation of evapotranspiration, which may be considered a fundamental component. This factor considers climatological variables collected from weather stations that are spread over large areas. However, there are frequent cases of long periods of missing data. We evaluated the performance of a Bayesian Network inference model for estimating evapotranspiration in a large agricultural region in Brazil.

The algorithm has the purpose of analyzing the images returning the prediction of the SPAD value, therefore a relative measure of the nutritional status of the plants. In commercial application, the regressor could allow fertilization to be remotely steered to avoid or remedy nutrient deficiencies. The experiment concerned the indoor growth of Ocimum Basilicum (cv. “Genovese”), for 22 days after transplanting. During the growth cycle, five nutritional regimens were applied: surplus (160% and 130%), optimal (100%) and deficit (70% and 30%) starting from a slightly modified Hoagland nutrient solution and the experimental scheme used was randomized blocks. The architecture of the regression algorithm has foreseen the implementation of 13 layers, four validation metrics have been foreseen, such as MSE, MAE, R2 and r. The algorithm was trained for 1200 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001. Performance was encouraging, achieving low (dimensionless) MSE and MAE values of 2.92 and 1.32, respectively, and R2 and r coefficients of 0.94 and 0.97, respectively.

Consequently, variations in the yields of tomatoes could have large social and economic implications. However, extreme weather events, such as droughts, are increasingly common and widespread due to the ongoing climate crisis. Therefore, assessing the behaviour of crops in response to this type of stress is extremely important to guarantee a stable and reliable food source. To this end, this work proposes an end-to-end tomato evaluation strategy based on image processing and machine learning algorithms. The proposed pipeline allows domain experts to automatically evaluate relevant phenotypical traits of a population of genotypic mutants, comparing them with their Red Setter regarding the response to drought stress. The framework uses a simple, low-cost, and easy-to-use setup, which allows the rapid acquisition of a wide dataset. This can be acquired in different instants, providing temporal-dependent information on the response of the crops to different scenarios, which can be used to estimate relevant phenotypical traits. To evaluate its effectiveness, the processing pipeline was evaluated over two weeks, with a total of 388 mutants compared with 12 Red Setter, exploiting canopy coverage to assess the overall resnonse of the mutants to drought stress.","","979-8-3503-5544-4","10.1109/MetroAgriFor63043.2024.10948752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10948752","Tomato Seedling;Genotypic Assessment;Segmentation;Gaussian Mixture Models","Economics;Machine learning algorithms;Image processing;Droughts;Pipelines;Crops;Metrology;Reliability;Stress;Gaussian mixture model","","","","15","IEEE","11 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to its ability to capture rich information about the material properties of the target, HSI has found applications such as agriculture, ecological monitoring, urban planning, and medicine. However, HSI images tend to have high spatial resolution and many channels, thus requiring models that can integrate information over a large context and identify spectral signatures. HSI classification datasets are also highly imbalanced, sparsely labeled, and significantly smaller than standard vision datasets like ImageNet or CIFAR, thus motivating smaller models with high sample efficiency. This work combines the strengths of multi-scale representations and data-driven feature learning. We generalize the butterfly transform to a learned complex-valued butterfly layer, allowing for parameter-efficient extraction of hierarchical complex-valued features from 1D signals. This allows us to create a lean yet highly accurate hyperspectral image classification model. Benchmarked on the Indian Pines, ROSIS-03 Pavia University, and Salinas datasets, our method demonstrates accuracy on par with SSDGL while using $7\mathbf{x}$ fewer parameters.

The first stage is application dependent, with the aim of detecting all seal pups in the image, with the expense of detecting a large amount of false objects. The second stage extracts generic image features from a local image corresponding to each potential seal detected in the first stage using a CNN trained on the ImageNet database. In the third stage we apply a linear support vector machine to classify the feature vectors extracted in the second stage. The proposed method was demonstrated to an aerial image that contains 84 pups and 128 adult harp seals, and the results show that we are able to detect the seals with high accuracy (2.7% for the adults and 7.3% for the pups). We conclude that deep CNNs trained on the ImageNet database are well suited as a feature extraction module, and using a simple linear SVM, we were able to separate seals from other objects with very high accuracy.

This paper explores using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Kriging to develop GIS layers for a heat-based risk index. Recent increases in global mean temperatures have led to more frequent and intense heat waves, impacting food supply, vegetation, and human health. Optimal plant growth temperatures in temperate climates range from 20°C to 30°C, with nighttime temperatures also being critical. Exceeding these temperature ranges can reduce plant immunity, cause disease, and result in poor crop yields. For example, mango cultivars need a ""safe"" temperature range of 10°C to 12°C to avoid damage. The intensification of higher temperatures established July 2023 record the hottest days on Earth, highlighting the need for effective monitoring and management tools. IDW, a deterministic method, offers a straightforward and efficient approach by assuming closer points have more influence. Kriging, a probabilistic geostatistical technique, accounts for spatial autocorrelation and prediction uncertainty, making it suitable for complex datasets. The study compares these methods' performance in creating continuous surfaces representing heat-based risk. IDW is simple and efficient but less accurate in sparsely populated areas, while Kriging is more accurate and detailed but requires more computational resources and expertise. An automated workflow for data preprocessing, model training, and cross-validation ensures consistent results. The study recommends adopting IDW for initial assessments and transitioning to Kriging as expertise grows. Enhanced data collection on temperature and population density is also advised to improve GIS layer accuracy, aiding better decision-making and resource allocation to mitigate extreme heat effects on agriculture and public health.","2687-8828","979-8-3503-5372-3","10.1109/ISSE63315.2024.10741115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10741115","Anomaly detection;System identification;Climate change;Risk management;Complex systems","Heating systems;Support vector machines;Training;Temperature distribution;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Decision making;Linear regression;Resource management;Random forests;Climate change","","","","21","IEEE","6 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

LAI and CCC are biophysical parameters indicator of crop health state and fundamental in the productivity prediction. The purpose is to define the most optimal LAI and CCC estimation method for operational use in the monitoring of agricultural areas. Moreover, the CCC and LAI automatic products obtained directly through the Sentinel Application Platform Software (SNAP) biophysical processor and Sentine1-2 images by means of an artificial neural network (ANN) are validated. On the other hand, common vegetation indices used to LAI and CCC retrieval are analyzed. Both methods were tested using a dataset composed of LAI and CCC in situ data, obtained in an agricultural area near Caserta (Italy). As a result, Sentine1-2 automatic products present good statistics for LAI $(\mathrm{R}^{2}=0.86$, RMSE $=0.80$) and CCC ($\mathrm{R}^{2}=0.85$, RMSE $=0.68\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$), without producing saturation at high LAI values. On the other hand, the best index for LAI retrieval was the normalized SeLI index $(\mathrm{R}^{2} = 0.81$, RMSE $= 0.87$) and for CCC, the three-band TCARI index ($\mathrm{R}^{2} = 0.81$, RMSE $= 0.61 \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$). But the SeLI index produces a saturation process with LAI values higher than 3.5. The main conclusion of this study, hence, is that Sentine1-2 Level 2A products, such as the LAI and CCC parameter, have great potential to be used automatically and operationally in agricultural studies, minimizing time and economic costs.","","978-1-7281-3611-0","10.1109/MetroAgriFor.2019.8909218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8909218","LAI;canopy chlorophyll content;vegetation indices;Sentinel-2;validation","Indexes;Vegetation mapping;Estimation;Agriculture;Monitoring;Remote sensing;Satellites","","5","","38","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Medical image databases are currently available to supply clinical diagnosis. For instance, it is possible to provide diagnostic information based on an imaging biomarker comparing a single case to the reference group (controls or patients with disease). At the same time many sophisticated and computationally intensive algorithms have been implemented to extract useful information from medical images. Many applications would take great advantage by using scientific workflow technology due to its design, rapid implementation and reuse. However this technology requires a distributed computing infrastructure (such as Grid or Cloud) to be executed efficiently. One of the most used workflow manager for medical image processing is the LONI pipeline (LP), a graphical workbench developed by the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (http://pipeline.loni.usc.edu). In this article we present a general approach to submit and monitor workflows on distributed infrastructures using LONI Pipeline, including European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) and Torque-based batch farm. In this paper we implemented a complete segmentation pipeline in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It requires time-consuming and data-intensive processing and for which reducing the computing time is crucial to meet clinical practice constraints. The developed approach is based on web services and can be used for any medical imaging application.","","978-1-4673-9172-6","10.1109/MeMeA.2016.7533716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7533716","MRI analysis;Hippocampus Segmentation;Workflows;Distribuited analysis;Loni Pipeline","Pipelines;Neuroimaging;Biomedical imaging;Web services;Magnetic resonance imaging;Protocols;Standards","","","","26","IEEE","8 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, a greenhouse inner micro-climate, which is the result of an extensive set of inter-related environmental variables influenced by external weather conditions, has to be tightly monitored, regulated, and, some-times, forecast. Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Machine Learning (ML) are two of the most successful technologies to deal with this challenge. In this paper, we discuss how a Smart Gateway (GW), acting as a collector for sensor data coming from a WSN installed in a greenhouse, could be enriched with a Neural Network (NN)-based prediction model allowing to forecast a greenhouse's inner air temperature. In the case of missing sensor data coming from the WSN, the proposed prediction algorithm, fed with meteorological open data (gathered from the DarkSky repository), is run on the GW in order to predict the missing values. Despite the model is especially designed to be lightweight and executable by a device with constrained capabilities, it can be adopted either at Cloud or at GW level to forecast future air temperature's values, in order to support the management of a greenhouse. Experimental results show that the NN-based prediction algorithm can forecast greenhouse air temperature with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.50 °C, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 4.91%, and a R2 score of 0.965.","","978-1-7281-8783-9","10.1109/MetroAgriFor50201.2020.9277553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277553","Internet of Things;Smart Farming;Edge AI;DNN;Greenhouse Management;Wireless Sensor Network;WSN","Green products;Predictive models;Temperature sensors;Atmospheric modeling;Temperature measurement;Temperature distribution;Prediction algorithms","","25","","24","IEEE","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, most methods for yield forecasting are based on historical data and yield estimates from manually collected samples. More modern approaches often rely on computer vision-based fruit counting algorithms, which do not take individual crop weights into account.In this paper, we propose a novel, non-destructive method to estimate the mass of individual pieces of fruit by exploiting the dynamic properties of plants. By observing short-term oscillatory plant motion through RGB-D video data, we formulate an approach for mass estimation based on determining the parameters of a damped harmonic oscillator model.We test the proposed algorithm by collecting a dataset of around 300 video samples of strawberries on a real strawberry farm and apply our method. With a semi-automated toolchain, capable of inferring the key parameters from video data and calculating the mass of individual berries from those, we were able to estimate the mass of all berries in our dataset with a median error of 1.16g, outperforming a baseline utilising vision-based volume estimation to infer the mass. These insights hold valuable improvements for the development of yield forecasting systems and selective harvesters, which help to address the sustainability of food production and labour shortages.","2161-8089","979-8-3503-5851-3","10.1109/CASE59546.2024.10711606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10711606","","Heuristic algorithms;Volume measurement;Dynamics;Crops;Production;Yield estimation;Forecasting;Sustainable development;Robots;Oscillators","","1","","25","IEEE","23 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We compared multi-task architectures with various prediction heads for state estimation, information gain, expected loss, and best view prediction from observation sequences. Our results show that entropy-minimizing and loss-maximizing strategies outperform random sampling, with accuracy improvements of up to 11.9%. However, training multiple model heads simultaneously presented challenges, with convergence issues and training instability depending on the optimization problem formulation.Future work will explore adaptive multi-task training strategies, the impact of dataset size, and whole environment mapping.

The quantitative estimation of many plant traits (leaf area index, biomass etc.) from plant images is primarily based on accurate segmentation of individual leaves. This is a challenging task due to the presence of overlapped leaves and lack of discernible boundaries between them. To overcome these limitations, state-of-the-art supervised deep learning algorithms have been recently employed. However, the annotations of individual leaf instances is time consuming, in addition the variability in leaf shapes and its arrangement among different plant species limits the broad utilisation of these algorithms. To relieve this bottleneck, we propose a novel framework that relies on a graph based formulation to extract leaf shape knowledge for the task of leaf instance segmentation. These shape priors are generated based on leaf shape characteristics independent of plant species. Evaluation of the proposed framework on multiple plant datasets i.e. Arabidopsis, Komatsuna and salad demonstrates its broad utility.","1051-4651","978-1-7281-8808-9","10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9411981","Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9411981","","Deep learning;Image segmentation;Shape;Annotations;Estimation;Pattern recognition;Biomass","","3","","42","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many significant cyber security attacks on UAVs have occurred in recent years due to a lack of vulnerability assessments and inadequate security countermeasures. A Trojan attack is a type of cyberattack where Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models are poisoned by injecting malicious modifications into the original design, which leads the DNN to misclassify certain inputs after being triggered. In this paper, we investigate Trojan attacks against neural networks. For a Trojan attack, we consider the DroNet architecture. DroNet is a convolutional neural network capable of safely driving a UAV across city streets. DroNet navigates UAVs by predicting steering angles and collision probabilities from camera images. For the attacking purpose, we have generated poisonous collision and steering angle datasets for DroNet. The TrojAI software framework is used to generate poisonous datasets and Trojan models. First, the effectiveness of the Trojan attack is examined on the DroNet model using poisonous and steering angle datasets. Then, we regulate the intensity of the designed trigger and review the performance of the DroNet architecture. Finally, we proposed a trojan detection technique using label visualization for clean and poisonous datasets.","","979-8-3503-1170-9","10.1109/CSR57506.2023.10224932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10224932","","Visualization;Navigation;Urban areas;Computer architecture;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Software;Trojan horses","","6","","33","IEEE","28 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fitting models to the data offer an avenue to extract patterns from the data, make predictions, and leverage them to understand phenomena and decision-making. Innovations in deep learning and their ability to capture non-linear interactions between features make them particularly relevant for spatial datasets.

However, accurately counting fruits poses challenges, particularly due to occlusions. This study proposes a multi-view sensing approach using continuous motion videos captured by a camera moved along the row of trees, followed by fruit detection in all video frames and application of Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) algorithms to prevent double-counting. Three tracking methods, namely SORT, DeepSORT, and ByteTrack, are compared for fruit counting using the YOLOv5x object detector. The methodology is applied to map fruit production in an experimental apple orchard at two different dates: four weeks and one week before harvest. The results demonstrate that ByteTrack (MOTA=0.682; IDF1=0.837; HOTA=0.689) outperforms SORT and DeepSORT, indicating its superior tracking performance. Computational efficiency analysis reveals similar processing times between SORT and ByteTrack (about 15 ms), while DeepSORT requires significantly more processing time per image (128 ms). Fruit counting evaluation shows reasonably accurate yield predictions on both dates, with reduced errors and improved performance closer to the harvest date (MAPE=7.47 %; $R^{2}$=0.70). The system proves effective in estimating orchard fruit production using computer vision technology, offering valuable insights for yield forecasting.

This problem is addressed in this work that investigates removing dust to improve tillage quality monitoring. First, a camera was mounted to the rear of a disc harrow to record images during tillage. Since the images showed larger parts of the surrounding environment, the images were cropped to the working area, which is important for tillage quality monitoring.

Remote sensing and supervised segmentation of hyperspectral images (HIs) have become a fast and precise solution of PA for the identification of problems in crops. However, wellknown problems for knowledge extraction in HIs are related to data volumes and capacity for modeling each phenomenal due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. Some techniques for dealing with dimensionality, such as genetic algorithms (GAs), are promising, but they cannot assure a compromise between the segmentation effectiveness and reduction of dimensionality. In this paper, a multi-objective method based on Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 2 and Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier is proposed for supervised segmentation of HIs dealing with the problem of dimensionality. Experiments with three datasets and cross-validation showed that the proposed method reduced the average number of bands between 75.4% and 88.2% for each evaluation. In addition to reducing the number of bands, statistical tests showed that our method had a pixel classification performance equivalent or more significant than other state-of-the-art methods.

Flavescence dorée (FD) is a phytoplasma transmitted by a leafhopper (Scaphoideus titanus), thus after a few plants are diseased the whole vineyard is quarantined and, in the most severe cases, destroyed. FD symptoms may vary according to the variety, including altered coloration and texture of the leaves. Scientists typically detect the disease using molecular analysis and only recently by leveraging visual inspection techniques, such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI). However, the molecular test is insufficient to detect the disease in asymptomatic samples. This work proposes a novel approach based on HSI and Machine Learning (ML) to increase the success rate of disease detection on asymptomatic samples. We collected the average spectral response of 100 samples (10 of which are healthy), subdivided into 3 classes: Healthy, Asymptomatic, and Diseased. Due to the low number of samples in the dataset, we also propose a synthetic augmentation procedure leveraging a Constrained Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate 103 spectra per class. From the synthetic spectra, we calculate 10 vegetation indexes: NDVI, RGI, CI, mCARI, REP, CUR, mARI, mARI2 (proposed in this work), ACI, and mACI. These values are used as the input features of an Ensemble of 30 Bagged Trees to classify the samples into the 3 classes. The model was tested on the real 100 samples, achieving a True Positive Rate (TPR) per class equal to 80%, 93%, and 96% respectively. As a further contribution, we evaluated the system's performance on real data using a Bayesian test.","","979-8-3503-5544-4","10.1109/MetroAgriFor63043.2024.10948804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10948804","Flavescence dorée;machine learning;measurement science;hyperspectral imaging;neural network","Visualization;Normalized difference vegetation index;System performance;Neural networks;Vegetation mapping;Machine learning;Predictive models;Bayes methods;Diseases;Hyperspectral imaging","","","","19","IEEE","11 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work aims to propose a novel approach to scale the DMP parameters through two demonstrations in order to enhance the DMP’s generalization capability in the robot reachable workspace while guaranteeing a fast and easy learning phase. The proposed method to scale the DMP parameters relies on a linear interpolation performed on the DMP parameters extracted by two demonstrations and is applied to the agricultural field, where the adoption of DMPs can provide a promising solution to meet the demand for a wide range of tasks in an ever-changing and mutable agricultural environment. Four agricultural activities, namely digging, seeding, irrigation, and harvesting, have been learned by the robot using DMPs. The experimental validation was carried out on the Tiago robot and the proposed approach, based on two demonstrations, was compared to two literature methods based on a single demonstration and multiple demonstrations in terms of accuracy of the motion reconstruction, success rate of task execution and speed of the learning process. The obtained results demonstrated that the proposed approach, based on two demonstrations, guarantees a successful execution of the four tasks without exceeding the robot reachable workspace and with acceptable accuracy (mean success rate of task execution is about 95.6%) and a fast training phase (about 70 minutes less than the database approach that is built on multiple demonstrations).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3349093","Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) through the Project Future Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR)(grant numbers:CUP: C53C22000800006); Piano Operativo Nazionale (PON) “Ricerca e Innovazione” 2014–2020; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10379077","Learning by demonstration;teaching by demonstration;robot learning;dynamic motion primitives;motion planning;agricultural robotics","Robots;Task analysis;Planning;Trajectory;Robot sensing systems;Dynamics;Robustness;Robot learning;Motion planning","","7","","51","CCBY","1 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle the complexities of temporal classification in pine tree growth, we propose a novel measurement system that uses image data to leverage the power of different deep transfer learning-based convolutional neural networks. To classify pine trees over time, our approach integrates different state-of-the-art transfer learning models based on the features extracted by SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, ShuffieNet, and ResNetXt into our measurement system. The primary challenge in tem-porally sorting plant growth is that instances within the same class exhibit variations, whereas instances belonging to different classes may share similarities. We also addressed a pivotal question: whether focusing on the region of interest (ROI) as the input improves the final results. To explore this, we defined two distinct scenarios and conducted a comparative analysis to elucidate the impact of varied input images on the efficacy of our measurement systems. Our experimental results highlight the superior performance of deep SqueezeNet transfer learning over other models, with an error reduction of 15% compared to the second-best approach.

One is a new data augmentation method designed for the stereographic projection of omnidirectional images. The other is a distortion-adaptive Gaussian kernel that generates a density map ground truth while taking into account the distortion of stereographic projection. Using the counting of grape bunches as a case study, we constructed an original grape-bunch image dataset consisting of omnidirectional images and conducted experiments to evaluate the proposed method.

A large array of different sensors is deployed using various platforms such as uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites. In this context, while multiple concepts of scale exist, the influence of spatial scale plays a major role when comparing and validating optical data derived from either of these platforms. Until to date, no satisfying method to allow cross sensor and scale studies exists. The presented work proposes a custom U-Net architecture to convert multispectral UAV imagery to multispectral satellite imagery. U-Nets are convolutional networks that have shown to be capable of learning mapping patterns between an input image and an output image. Therefore, artificially created images resembles original images at a high level of local detail and global semantic coherence. By using a multi-year, multispectral image UAV dataset, capturing a biologically and structural complex pathosystem (Cercosopora beticola + Beta vulgaris L.), it is shown that the developed custom U-Net can convert original UAV images with low structural and spectral error (MSE of 0.0001, SSIM test score of 0.0003, DWT test score of 0.0104, and a PSNR value of 40.3551) into artificial satellite images. Also, it is compared whether band center and bandwidth are accurately converted. To showcase an application, artificial images have been used to classify levels of Cercospora Leaf Spot in sugar beet. Classification accuracies are similar to those derived from the classification using original images. Therefore, it can be concluded that image to image translation using U-Nets can be a powerful tool for scaling studies in remote sensing. But they also offer to address the issue of data sparsity in machine learning as the conversion allows to generate images across different scales, therefore potentially adding valuable data to time-series studies.","","979-8-3503-1272-0","10.1109/MetroAgriFor58484.2023.10424276","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10424276","deep learning;drones;multispectral;plant pathology;scale","Satellites;Machine learning;Forestry;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Sugar industry;Remote sensing;Sensor arrays","","1","","19","IEEE","12 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This process is especially difficult due to the intrinsic variable nature of ID models (text fields, multi-pass printing with offset, unstable layouts, added artifacts, blinking security elements, nonrigid materials). We tackle the problem by putting different combinations of features in competition within a multi-hypothesis exploration where only the best document quadrilateral candidate is retained thanks to a custom visual similarity metric.

In this type of highly imbalanced classification problems, which encompass complex features, deep learning (DL) is much needed because of its strong detection capabilities. At the same time, DL is observed in practice to favor majority over minority classes and consequently suffer from inaccurate detection of the targeted early-stage indications. To simulate such scenarios, we artificially generate skewness (99% vs. 1%) for certain plant types out of the PlantVillage dataset as a basis for classification of scarce visual cues through transfer learning. By randomly and unevenly picking healthy and unhealthy samples from certain plant types to form a training set, we consider a base experiment as fine-tuning ResNet34 and VGG19 architectures and then testing the model performance on a balanced dataset of healthy and unhealthy images. We empirically observe that the initial F1 test score jumps from 0.29 to 0.95 for the minority class upon adding a final Batch Normalization (BN) layer just before the output layer in VGG19. We demonstrate that utilizing an additional BN layer before the output layer in modern CNN architectures has a considerable impact in terms of minimizing the training time and testing error for minority classes in highly imbalanced data sets. Moreover, when the final BN is employed, minimizing the loss function may not be the best way to assure a high F1 test score for minority classes in such problems. That is, the network might perform better even if it is not `confident' enough while making a prediction; leading to another discussion about why softmax output is not a good uncertainty measure for DL models. We also report on the corroboration of these findings on the ISIC Skin Cancer as well as the Wall Crack datasets.","1051-4651","978-1-7281-8808-9","10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9412907","Ministry of Science & Technology, Israel; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9412907","","Training;Visualization;Uncertainty;Measurement uncertainty;Transfer learning;Pipelines;Predictive models","","3","","35","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, hyperspectral images can play a useful role, but require specific handling. This paper presents a convolutional neural network based on one-dimensional support vector machine (SVM) convolution operations (1D-CSVM) for the analysis of hyperspectral images. SVM-based CNN (CSVM) was introduced first for the classification of high spatial resolution RGB images. It relies on linear SVMs to create filter banks in the convolution layers. In this work, the network is modified to cope with one-dimensional hyperspectral signatures and perform pixel-based classification. It thus analyzes each pixel spectrum independently from the pixel spatial neighborhood. Experiments were carried out on four benchmark hyperspectral datasets, Salinas-A, Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Indian Pines (IP) and Pavia University (Pavia-U). Compared to state-of-the-art models, the proposed network produces promising results for all tested datasets, with an accuracy up to 99.76%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3231579","Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Italy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996412","Convolutional neural network;feedforward learning;hyperspectral signature;machine learning;pixel-based classification;support vector machine","Support vector machines;Hyperspectral imaging;Filter banks;Convolutional neural networks;IP networks;Feature extraction;Convolution","","17","","41","CCBYNCND","21 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recent time it has been observed that most of the coconut trees are affected by the diseases which gradually reduces the strength and production of coconut. Most of the tree leaves are affected by pest diseases and nutrient deficiency. Our main intensive is to enhance the livelihood of coconut leaves and identify the diseases at the early stage so that farmers get more benefits from coconut production. This paper proposes the detection of pest attack and nutrient deficiency in the coconut leaves and analysis of the diseases. Coconut leaves monitorization has been taken place after the use of pesticides and fertilizer with the help of the finest machine learning and image processing techniques. Rather than human experts, automatic recognition will be beneficial and the fastest approach to identify the diseases in the coconut leaves very efficiently. Thus, in this project, we developed an android mobile application to identify the pests by their food behaviors, pest diseases and the nutrition deficiencies in the coconut trees. As an initial step, all datasets for image processing technology met pre-processing steps such as converting RGB to greyscale, filtering, resizing, horizontal flip and vertical flip. After completing the above steps, the classification was performed by analyzing several algorithms in the literature review. SVM and CNN were chosen as the best and appropriate classifier with 93.54% and 93.72% of accuracy respectively. The outcome of this project will help the farmers to increase the coconut production and undoubtedly will make a revolution in the agriculture sector.","","978-1-7281-7574-4","10.1109/IPAS50080.2020.9334934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9334934","coconut leaves diseases;deep learning;image processing;pest attacks;nutrition deficiency","Support vector machines;Image processing;Production;Prediction algorithms;Mobile applications;Monitoring;Diseases","","48","","14","IEEE","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
