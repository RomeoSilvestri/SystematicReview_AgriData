Climate change increases both the frequency and the intensity of such shocks. To safeguard farmers' income and food production, climate adaptation measures are required. This article aims to examine the effectiveness of crop diversification as an adaptation measure, using Italy as a case study. We apply a control function approach to a panel dataset of 20,790 Italian farms, which considers (i) the crop diversification decision and (ii) the influence of crop diversification on farmers' levels of crop income and income risk. We find that, while specialisation can increase income, crop diversification reduces income risk most effectively when growing four different crops. At this level of diversification, income risk is approximately 29% lower as opposed to monoculture farming. Although the Common Agricultural Policy's greening payments for crop diversification make sense from an ecological and risk-reducing point of view, we find that they are potentially insufficient to cover the loss of expected crop income from diversification. While crop diversification reduces income risk in general, we find no specific benefit in terms of weather shock-induced risks. This may be because a price increase following a weather shock buffers its adverse effect. However, identifying the reasons requires further research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change Adaptation; Crop Diversification; Income Risk; Italian Agriculture; Risk Mitigation; Adaptive Management; Climate Change; Common Agricultural Policy; Crop Plant; Food Production; Income; Monoculture; Panel Data; Risk Assessment; Italy","adaptive management; climate change; Common Agricultural Policy; crop plant; food production; income; monoculture; panel data; risk assessment; Italy","","","","Abson, David James, Landscape diversity and the resilience of agricultural returns: A portfolio analysis of land-use patterns and economic returns from lowland agriculture, Agriculture and Food Security, 2, 1, (2013); Altieri, Miguel Angel, Agroecology and the design of climate change-resilient farming systems, Agronomy for Sustainable Development, 35, 3, pp. 869-890, (2015); Angrist, Joshua D., Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricist's companion, (2008); Antle, John M., Testing the stochastic structure of production: A flexible moment-based approach, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 1, 3, pp. 192-201, (1983); Antle, John M., Asymmetry, partial moments, and production risk, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 92, 5, pp. 1294-1309, (2010); Asfaw, Solomon, Diversification Strategies and Adaptation Deficit: Evidence from Rural Communities in Niger, World Development, 101, pp. 219-234, (2018); Auci, Sabrina, Climate variability, innovation and firm performance: evidence from the European agricultural sector, European Review of Agricultural Economics, 48, 5, pp. 1074-1108, (2021); Auci, Sabrina, Climate variability and agriculture in Italy: a stochastic frontier analysis at the regional level, Economia Politica, 37, 2, pp. 381-409, (2020); Baumgärtner, Stefan, The insurance value of biodiversity in the provision of ecosystem services, Natural Resource Modeling, 20, 1, pp. 87-127, (2007); Beillouin, Damien, Evidence map of crop diversification strategies at the global scale, Environmental Research Letters, 14, 12, (2019)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","14779552; 0021857X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196299289"

More specifically, land consumption (LC), due to the occupation of originally agricultural, natural, or semi-natural areas, implies a progressive loss of key environmental resources and ecosystem services (ESs), reducing the individual well-being. Furthermore, policy makers need data on the benefits of public goods in monetary terms to support well-being-oriented decision-making. This work seeks to demonstrate that life satisfaction approach (LSA) can be applied to a practical assessment goal with the intention to give a monetary value to the LC and consequently to a loss of important ESs. The Italian case study is investigated with the help of a national survey database reporting the subjective well-being index (SWBI) subsequently grouped by regions. The overall intent is to make explicit to the policymakers that biodiversity and ESs are valuable to society and that their further degradation will result in irreversible damages to local communities. Using nationally representative data from the Multi-Purpose Survey on Italian Families in Italy over 2012–2016, results suggest that the national average annual income willingness to accept (WTA) related to consumed land is equal to −0.0827 €/m2 on average, while the social cost for LC and the loss of related ESs affects 0.01% of the Italian GDP per year. Finally, the possibility of estimating and comparing the WTA with the land market values brings the method presented here closer to cost-based estimates overcoming the limitations of contingent valuation methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ecosystem Services (ess); Land Consumption (lc); Land Uses (lus); Life Satisfaction Approach (lsa); Subjective Well-being Index (swbi)","","","","Open access funding provided by Politecnico di Torino within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.","Aguado, Mateo, Exploring subjective well-being and ecosystem services perception along a rural–urban gradient in the high Andes of Ecuador, Ecosystem Services, 34, pp. 1-10, (2018); Ahmadi Mirghaed, F., Decision scenarios using ecosystem services for land allocation optimization across Gharehsoo watershed in northern Iran, Ecological Indicators, 117, (2020); Alam, Rafat, The conversion of biodiversity-rich land and ecosystem services, Environmental Economics and Policy Studies, 20, 1, pp. 157-178, (2018); Alfonso, Amanda, Perceived changes in environmental degradation and loss of ecosystem services, and their implications in human well-being, International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 24, 6, pp. 561-574, (2017); Ambrey, Christopher L., Public Greenspace and Life Satisfaction in Urban Australia, Urban Studies, 51, 6, pp. 1290-1321, (2014); Ambrey, Christopher L., Valuing Ecosystem Diversity in South East Queensland: A Life Satisfaction Approach, Social Indicators Research, 115, 1, pp. 45-65, (2014); Barrington-Leigh, Christopher P., Life satisfaction and sustainability: a policy framework, SN Social Sciences, 1, 7, (2021); Bateman, Ian J., Economic Analysis for the UK National Ecosystem Assessment: Synthesis and Scenario Valuation of Changes in Ecosystem Services, Environmental and Resource Economics, 57, 2, pp. 273-297, (2014); Bertram, Christine, The role of urban green space for human well-being, Ecological Economics, 120, pp. 139-152, (2015); Botes, Chad M., Trees, ground vegetation, sidewalks, cycleways: users’ preferences and economic values for different elements of an urban street—a case study in Taipei, Environmental Economics and Policy Studies, 23, 1, pp. 145-171, (2021)","","Springer","","","","","","18687873; 18687865","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150366567"

Unlike the monetary (income) motivations, non-monetary drivers can not be directly observed but can be identified from observational data within appropriate quasi-experimental designs. A theoretical justification of farmers' choices is first formulated and a consequent natural experiment setting is derived. The latter admits heterogeneous, i.e. Individual, Treatment Effects (ITE) that, in turn, can be interpreted in terms of more targeted and tailored policy expenditure. A Causal Forest (CF) approach is adopted to estimate these ITEs for both the treated and not treated units. The approach is applied to two balanced panel samples of Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) farms observed over the 2008–2018 period and concerns agri-environmental policies delivered through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

However, those sectors have been criticized for generating negative environmental externalities. In this context, adopting indicators able to evaluate agriculture and sheep farming sustainability is essential for fostering sustainable development in the primary sector and defining appropriate policies to support it. Such indicators are crucial for understanding if European Union policies striving to realize win–win opportunities based on synergy between farms’ environmental and economic dimensions are realistic. This paper focuses on this wave of interest and has two aims. First, it intends to investigate the existence of synergies or trade-offs between those dimensions using a trade-off analysis. To this end, a significant set of economic and environmental farm indicators was selected, and two composite indicators were created. Second, it aims to investigate the relationship between those two indicators and some pivotal structural and socio-demographic variables. This study was carried out on 219 Sardinian sheep farms included in the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network. The findings showed a low synergy between the economic and environmental spheres, a relationship between economic indicators and farmers’ ages and organic production variables, and no relationships between the environmental dimension and the analyzed variables. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dairy Farming; European Policy; Livestock; Sardinia; Sustainability Indicators; Synergies; Economic Conditions; European Union; Livestock Farming; Sheep; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Trade-off; United Nations","economic conditions; European Union; livestock farming; sheep; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; trade-off; United Nations","","","","Atzori, Alberto Stanislao, Sustainability in the Sardinian sheep sector: A systems perspective, from good practices to policy, Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management, 18, 5, pp. 1187-1198, (2022); Kanter, David R., Evaluating agricultural trade-offs in the age of sustainable development, Agricultural Systems, 163, pp. 73-88, (2018); Arru, Brunella, The Circular Economy in the Agri-food system: A Performance Measurement of European Countries, Economia Agro-Alimentare, 24, 2, (2022); Feeding Future Generations how Finance can Boost Innovation in Agri Food, (2019); Díaz de Otálora, Xabier, Evaluating three-pillar sustainability modelling approaches for dairy cattle production systems, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2021); Finco, Adele, Lessons of innovation in the agrifood sector: Drivers of innovativeness performances, Economia Agro-Alimentare, 20, 2, pp. 181-192, (2018); Data Trends of the European Food and Drink Industry, (2025); Grau-Grau, Alfredo J., Operating leverage and profitability of SMEs: agri-food industry in Europe, Small Business Economics, 57, 1, pp. 221-242, (2021); Juchniewicz, Małgorzata Grażyna, Diversity of the international competitive performance of the food industry of the European Union member states, Agribusiness, 37, 2, pp. 422-437, (2021); European Green Deal, (2019)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185349349"

The study hypothesis is that collective initiatives exerting countervailing power can attenuate the imbalance in the distribution of bargaining power that is considered one of the main causes of unfair trading practices. Our findings suggest that in a multidimensional bargaining setting where all contract terms are negotiated at once, there is no theoretical expectation that exerting countervailing power necessarily results in a mitigation of unfair trading practices. To investigate the topic empirically, we used a data set measuring fairness perception of a sample of Italian kiwifruit producers. The data support the hypothesis that membership in collective initiatives increases the probability that a farmer perceives a transaction as fair. However, countervailing power does not counter all unfair practices in the same way. While patrons of collective initiatives perceive benefits in price and quality determination practices, no such effect was found for contract renegotiation. The analysis compares two policy approaches: supporting countervailing power and banning specific practices (such as EU Directive 633/2019). We conclude that countervailing power is less effective in targeting specific unfair practices, but it is less likely to determine efficiency loss because it does not impose constraints on contractual negotiations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collective Action; Countervailing Power; Distributive Justice; Fairness; Unfair Trading Practices; Agricultural Market; Agricultural Production; Bargaining; Collective Action; Data Set; Perception","agricultural market; agricultural production; bargaining; collective action; data set; perception","","","The research originating this article was funded by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (Contract No. 936081 2018 A08 IT - Pass-through of Unfair Trading Practices in EU food supply chains: Methodology and Empirical Application"").

In this context, sustainability assessment implies considering different aspects of agricultural activities, including environmental, economic and social issues, and it is usually based on practice-based indicators. However, proposed methods and applications are still rare due to the difficulty to build a strong general framework and to find appropriate data. The present work develops a performance indicator framework using farm accounting data from the Italian Agricultural Accounting Information Network and proposes a multi-criteria approach based on the multiple reference point weak-strong composite indicators (MRP-WSCI) method to assess the degree of sustainability at the farm level. This method, widely applied to sustainability assessment, calculates the relative rankings including the weak and strong approaches to sustainability and facilitates an understanding of the different indices used, but it is still unused in the agricultural sector. The proposed evaluation framework shows that MRP-WSCI can handle a holistic set of indicators and rank the farms according to their level of sustainability, making it suitable for the agricultural farm sustainability assessment. Our results show that none of the farms in the case study sample can be classified as “good,” according to some of the indices produced, that is, the strong–strong and strong–weak index, while just two of them are good for the weak–weak index. Although the size of the sample used is small, the methodological approach proposed can be straightforwardly extended to larger samples. This methodology can provide information regarding the sustainability of farms to regional and/or national agricultural offices, agricultural extension workers, and farmers themselves, helping in understanding issues in specific dimensions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting; Assessment; Farm; Mrp-wsci; Multi-criteria Analysis; Sustainability; Agriculture; Information Services; Accounting; Assessment; Case-studies; Composite Indicators; Multi-criteria Approach; Multicriteria Analysis; Multiple Reference Point Weak-strong Composite Indicator; Multiple References; Reference Points; Sustainability Assessment; Sustainable Development","Agriculture; Information services; Accounting; Assessment; Case-studies; Composite indicators; Multi-criteria approach; Multicriteria analysis; Multiple reference point weak-strong composite indicator; Multiple references; Reference points; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable development","","","Funding text 1: This research was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Project PID2019‐104263RB‐C42); the Spanish Ministry of Science, Technology and Universities (Project RTI2018‐097620‐B‐100); the Regional Government of Andalucía (Project P18‐RT‐1566); and by the EU ERDF operative program (Project UMA18‐FEDERJA‐065).; Funding text 2: This research was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Project PID2019-104263RB-C42); the Spanish Ministry of Science, Technology and Universities (Project RTI2018-097620-B-100); the Regional Government of Andalucía (Project P18-RT-1566); and by the EU ERDF operative program (Project UMA18-FEDERJA-065).

Considering the scarce literature on ISCP, the case of Tuscany, one of the Italian regions that has implemented ISCPs most aggressively, was analyzed. The aim of this work is to give evidence of the potential positive effects of ISCPs for the agricultural sector by considering the differences between ISCP beneficiaries (treated) and non-ISCP farms (non-treated). The materials used for the analysis are twofold: the Italian Rural Network database and the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) dataset. The analysis is based on a three-year period (2018–2020). The sample consists of 1693 farms, outliers excluded. The treated farms included in the FADN sample total 134. The variables used are both structural and economic. The statistical analysis carried out compares treated and non-treated farms using the Welch-t-test. The results show that some key variables are significant (area; labour; revenues and costs). In general, the treated farms are more likely to improve their production process through EU funding and through new investments. In conclusion, the ISCP could be a good opportunity to support the sector. This work suggests that beneficiaries could achieve higher economic performance, especially when carrying out diversified activities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agro-industrial Chain; European Agricultural Fund For Rural Development; Farm Accountancy Data Network; Integrated Supply Chain Projects; Welch-t-test; Agricultural Economics; Agroindustry; European Union; Food Industry; Integrated Approach; Performance Assessment; Policy Implementation; Project Assessment; Rural Development; Rural Planning; Supply Chain Management; Italy; Tuscany","agricultural economics; agroindustry; European Union; food industry; integrated approach; performance assessment; policy implementation; project assessment; rural development; rural planning; supply chain management; Italy; Tuscany","","","Funding text 1: Integrated Supply Chain Projects (ISCPs), formal agreements between the actors of an agro-industrial chain, aim to improve the performance of the agricultural sector: profitability, infrastructure and farm management are the main issues []. This approach was introduced in Italy’s 2007–2013 National Strategic Plan (NSP) for rural development policy, with the aim of creating a strong coordination between farming behaviors at all stages of the supply chain, from primary production to consumption [,]. Indeed, the achievement of rural development policy objectives, whether related to the competitiveness of the sector or to the development of rural areas, also depends on the identification of effective intervention tools.

Integrated planning is presented as a method, since it does not have its own financial autonomy, but draws on measures or packages of measures of the RDP. At the same time, it favors integration between different subjects by targeting individual planning towards a common objective.

This European agricultural policy has adapted to the contemporary challenges faced by the new model of agricultural development. It aims to enhance the contribution of agriculture to the EU’s environmental and climate objectives while providing better targeted support to small-scale farmers to promote farms’ competitiveness. The main objective of this paper is to describe Italian farms and classify them into groups based on their main characteristics, as well as to analyze their performance and behavior in terms of sustainability and competitiveness. The novelty and innovativeness of this study are found in the data used; a 2020 dataset from the Italian Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN) was used. The quality of FADN data in farm sustainability assessment is widely acknowledge in the literature. To achieve the purpose of this study, a multivariate analysis, in particular, the Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and a Cluster Analysis (CA) were applied. These analyses helped us to obtain the factorial axes which then enabled us to identify economic information on farms, and a better interpretation of farmers’ aptitude to undertake environmentally friendly actions. As a result, eight groups of farms were identified, and their characteristics and performance were described at Italian district level. The results of the study reflect the influence of European interventions towards encouraging farmers to use more environmentally friendly agricultural practices. Under this perspective, the findings contribute to the current debate on green architecture pursued by the future European agricultural policy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cluster Analysis; Farm Accounting Data Network; Farm Sustainability; Multivariate Analysis; Agricultural Policy; Cluster Analysis; Common Agricultural Policy; Data Set; Multivariate Analysis; Italy","agricultural policy; cluster analysis; Common Agricultural Policy; data set; multivariate analysis; Italy","","","","Tijdschrift Voor Sociaal Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Van De Landbouw, (2003); Proceedings of the 132nd Seminar of the Eaae European Association of Agricultural Economists is Transition in European Agriculture Really Over; undefined, (2017); Proposal for A Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Amending Regulations Eu no 1308 2013 Establishing A Common Organisation of the Markets in Agricultural Products Eu no 1151 2012 on Quality Schemes for Agricultural Products and Foodstuffs Eu no 251 2014 on the Definition Description Presentation Labelling and the Protection of Geographical Indications of Aromatised Wine Products Eu no 228 2013 Laying Down Specific Measures for Agriculture in the Outermost Regio, (2018); Farah, Andrea Baudoin, Competitiveness vs. sustainability: An assessment of profitability as a component of an approach on ""sustainable competitiveness"" in extensive farming systems of central Spain, Sustainability (Switzerland), 6, 11, pp. 8029-8055, (2014); Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela, Sustainability and competitiveness of Romanian farms through organic agriculture, Sustainability (Switzerland), 8, 3, (2016); Kelly, Edel, Sustainability indicators for improved assessment of the effects of agricultural policy across the EU: Is FADN the answer?, Ecological Indicators, 89, pp. 903-911, (2018); Tait, Joyce, Sustainable development of agricultural systems: Competing objectives and critical limits, Futures, 32, 3-4, pp. 247-260, (2000); Coppola, Adele, Endogenous and exogenous determinants of agricultural productivity: What is the most relevant for the competitiveness of the Italian agricultural systems?, Agris On-line Papers in Economics and Informatics, 10, 2, pp. 33-47, (2018); Guth, Marta, The economic sustainability of farms under common agricultural policy in the European union countries, Agriculture (Switzerland), 10, 2, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","2073445X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149230331"

In this vein, European farmers are being incentivised to follow organic farming methods and participate in other agri-environmental policies aimed at reducing the use of chemicals in agriculture. In the literature, this concern with the use of pesticides is reflected by several studies that have used a quantitative approach to investigate the environmental effects of chemical inputs and the impact of agri-environmental subsidies on technical efficiency in farms. Nevertheless, there is a gap in knowledge in assessing the effect on technical efficiency in farms of completely eliminating the use of chemical products. The purpose of this research, then, was to analyse the effect on technical efficiency of a radical reduction in the use of pesticides in Italian farms, using sample data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) for the period 2004 to 2019, investigated in function of the different specialisation and economic size of the farms included in the data set. The level of technical efficiency in the farms included in the sample has been assessed through a non-parametric approach, using Data Envelopment Analysis in two stages, both with and then without the use of pesticides. The research findings have shown that a radical reduction in pesticides in Italian farms has had a direct impact on farms, reducing their level of technical efficiency. In particular, the results show that farms of a small economic size have suffered the greatest drop in technical efficiency. Meanwhile, the specialisation of the farm production has differently influenced the effect of a reduction in the use of chemical pesticides and fertilisers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agri-environmental Policy; Dea; Separability; Two-stage Dea; Type Of Farming","","","","","Aigner, Dennis J., Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models, Journal of Econometrics, 6, 1, pp. 21-37, (1977); Asmild, Mette, Measuring Inefficiency via Potential Improvements, Journal of Productivity Analysis, 19, 1, pp. 59-76, (2003); Badin, Luiza, How to measure the impact of environmental factors in a nonparametric production model, European Journal of Operational Research, 223, 3, pp. 818-833, (2012); Bakker, Lieneke, Kicking the Habit: What Makes and Breaks Farmers' Intentions to Reduce Pesticide Use?, Ecological Economics, 180, (2021); Baležentis, Tomas, On measures of the agricultural efficiency - A review, Transformations in Business and Economics, 13, 3, pp. 110-131, (2014); Banker, Rajiv D., SOME MODELS FOR ESTIMATING TECHNICAL AND SCALE INEFFICIENCIES IN DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS., Management Science, 30, 9, pp. 1078-1092, (1984); Barzman, Marco S., Comparative analysis of pesticide action plans in five European countries, Pest Management Science, 67, 12, pp. 1481-1485, (2011); Battese, George E., Frontier production functions, technical efficiency and panel data: With application to paddy farmers in India, Journal of Productivity Analysis, 3, 1-2, pp. 153-169, (1992); Battese, George E., A model for technical inefficiency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data, Empirical Economics, 20, 2, pp. 325-332, (1995); Applied Studies in Agribusiness and Commerce Apstract, (2012)","","Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria","","","","","","13100351","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148943081"

The analysis is based on the calculation of the inverse of Herfindahl index, by using different variables available in the Italian FADN database (years 2008, 2013 and 2018), followed by a multiple regression model to analyse the relationship between the diversification index and other variables, in order to highlight both the internal and external factors affecting on-farm diversification processes. The article shows that Italian farms have increasingly adopted non-agricultural revenue diversification strategies to reduce risk and maximize factors’ productivity. Among these, agritourism is by far the most relevant; however, in the last few years the production of renewable energy has been growing relatively rapidly. Overall, the study shows that on-farm diversification activities can be either an opportunity for a new entrepreneurship in agriculture or a survival strategy for small and marginal farms that are not sufficiently integrated in the national agri-food system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fadn; Farm Revenues; Herfindahl Index; On-farm Diversification","","","","","Balázs, Bálint, Multifunctional farming and survival strategies in the borsodi floodplain, pp. 285-305, (2009); Barbieri, Carla E., Why is diversification an attractive farm adjustment strategy?

This paper presents a fine-resolution in silico assessment of Miscanthus productivity in Italian marginal areas, also in the prospect of climate change. The Arungro biophysical model was used as simulation engine. The model was calibrated versus 13 multi-year experimental datasets collected in six Italian sites in the period 1992-2014, in both rainfed and well-irrigated conditions, assuming that nitrogen was not a limiting factor, no weed competition and no pest attacks. The model was linked to a spatiallyexplicit database, with data on i) current and climate change scenarios, ii) agro-management practices, iii) soil physical and hydrological properties, iv) land marginality and v) crop suitability to environment. Gridded simulations were performed at 500×500 m spatial resolution. Results analysis was centered on marginal areas in the province of Pisa (Central Italy), which was the most represented location in the calibration dataset. At field level, Arungro explained the 73% of the variability of aboveground biomass field measurements across sites, seasons, soils and alternative management (i.e. transplanting/cutting dates, stand density and water management). At province level, mean aboveground biomass estimates tended to slightly decrease in 2030 compared to baseline (-2.6%), although showing large variability across the province, according to the pedo-climatic conditions explored (relative changes in the range-20.9/+45.1%). Likewise, simulated changes in water use efficiency (average increase of +1.2%) are projected to fluctuate between-16.7% and +48.7%, suggesting that the amount of water needed to maintain the current production level under warmer scenarios will largely vary spatially across the province. Although the study needs to be extended to other provinces and diverse crop species, the analysis of preliminary results provides sitespecific indications on Miscanthus local suitability to farmers, crop specialists and public entities involved in the agricultural sector. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biophysical Models; Climate Change; Dry Matter; Perennial Energy Grasses; Yield; Biomass; Climate Models; Cost Effectiveness; Crops; Free Energy; Productivity; Water Management; Aboveground Biomass; Biomass Productivity; Biophysical Model; Dry Matters; Energy; In-silico; Miscanthus; Miscanthus×giganteus; Perennial Energy Grass; Yield; Climate Change","Biomass; Climate models; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Free energy; Productivity; Water management; Aboveground biomass; Biomass productivity; Biophysical model; Dry matters; Energy; In-silico; Miscanthus; Miscanthus×giganteus; Perennial energy grass; Yield; Climate change","","","This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture (MiPAAF) under the AGROENER project (D.D. n. 26329, 1 April 2016); http://agroener.crea.gov.it/","Boosting Biofuels Sustainable Paths to Greater Energy Security, (2016); Sallustio, Lorenzo, Assessing the economic marginality of agricultural lands in Italy to support land use planning, Land Use Policy, 76, pp. 526-534, (2018); Supit, Iwan, Assessing climate change effects on European crop yields using the Crop Growth Monitoring System and a weather generator, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 164, pp. 96-111, (2012); Donatelli, Marcello, Climate change impact and potential adaptation strategies under alternate realizations of climate scenarios for three major crops in Europe, Environmental Research Letters, 10, 7, (2015); Angelini, L.

These processes have impacted genome shaping in terms of inbreeding and regions under selection and resulted in differences between the northern and southern populations. Both inbreeding and signatures of selection can be pinpointed by the analysis of runs of homozygosity (ROH), which provides useful information to assist the management of this species in different rural areas. Results: We analyzed the ROH distribution and inbreeding (F<inf>ROH</inf>) in 902 goats from the Italian Goat Consortium2 dataset. We evaluated the differences in individual ROH number and length between goat breeds from Northern (NRD) and Central-southern (CSD) Italy. Then, we identified the signatures of selection that differentiate these two groups using three methods: ROH, ΔROH, and averaged F<inf>ST</inf>. ROH analyses showed that some Italian goat breeds have a lower inbreeding coefficient, which is attributable to their management and history. ROH are longer in breeds that are undergoing non-optimal management or with small population size. In several small breeds, the ROH length classes are balanced, reflecting more accurate mating planning. The differences in climate and management between the NRD and CSD groups have resulted in different ROH lengths and numbers: the NRD populations bred in isolated valleys present more and shorter ROH segments, while the CSD populations have fewer and longer ROH, which is likely due to the fact that they have undergone more admixture events during the horizontal transhumance practice followed by a more recent standardization. We identified four genes within signatures of selection on chromosome 11 related to fertility in the NRD group, and 23 genes on chromosomes 5 and 6 related to growth in the CSD group. Finally, we identified 17 genes on chromosome 12 related to environmental adaptation and body size with high homozygosity in both groups. Conclusions: These results show how different management practices have impacted the level of genomic inbreeding in two Italian goat groups and could be useful to assist management in a low-input system while safeguarding the diversity of small populations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation; Body Size; Climate Change; Ecological Impact; Farming System; Goat; Inbreeding; Management Practice; Italy; Animal; Genetics; Genome; Homozygote; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Animals; Genome; Goats; Homozygote; Inbreeding; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","adaptation; body size; climate change; ecological impact; farming system; goat; inbreeding; management practice; Italy; animal; genetics; genome; homozygote; single nucleotide polymorphism; Animals; Genome; Goats; Homozygote; Inbreeding; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","","","The authors thank all the researchers involved in the Italian Goat Consortium and the Italian National Breeders Association of Sheep and Goat (Asso.Na.Pa). The authors acknowledge support from the University of Milan through the APC initiative.","Bruford, Michael W., Prospects and challenges for the conservation of farm animal genomic resources, 2015-2025, Frontiers in Genetics, 6, OCT, (2015); Meuwissen, Theodorus H.E., Management of Genetic Diversity in the Era of Genomics, Frontiers in Genetics, 11, (2020); Senczuk, Gabriele, The genetic heritage of Alpine local cattle breeds using genomic SNP data, Genetics Selection Evolution, 52, 1, (2020); Talenti, Andrea, Studies of modern Italian dog populations reveal multiple patterns for domestic breed evolution, Ecology and Evolution, 8, 5, pp. 2911-2925, (2018); Cortellari, Matteo, The climatic and genetic heritage of Italian goat breeds with genomic SNP data, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); Manfredi, Maria Teresa, Breeding management in goat farms of Lombardy, northern Italy: Risk factors connected to gastrointestinal parasites, Small Ruminant Research, 88, 2-3, pp. 113-118, (2010); Sandrucci, Anna, Management practices and milk quality in dairy goat farms in Northern Italy, Italian Journal of Animal Science, 18, 1, pp. 1-12, (2019); Crepaldi, Paola, Factors affecting milk production and prolificacy of Alpine goats in Lombardy (Italy), Small Ruminant Research, 32, 1, pp. 83-88, (1999); Censimento Agricoltura, (2025); Di Trana, Adriana Carmen Lucia, The role of local sheep and goat breeds and their products as a tool for sustainability and safeguard of the mediterranean environment, pp. 77-112, (2015)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","0999193X; 12979686","","GSEVE","34895134","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121360835"

The efficiency in the use of the resources depends on the type of food which is produced and the adopted processes. In any case if food is discarded or lost at any step of the supply chain this represents a waste of energy and resources. For this reason, the LIFE project irexfo, coordinated by the University of Perugia has proposed a way to promote a business model aiming at both: the reduction of food losses and also the reuse of the not comestible food waste in biogas plants. The model has been tested in Umbria as a pilot region and in this study the results obtained are scaled up to a national level and applied to the Italian IO database reported in the EXIOBASE, to evaluate which could be the benefits of the application of the irexfo business model to the whole Italian agroindustry sector and also the interrelations between this sector and the Italian energy sector.

Italy is taking action to counteract this problem by following European guidelines. One of the most important measures is the Agrobiodiversity National Register (ANR), but 12 Italian regions currently appear without any landraces and around 80% of the landraces listed are trees, with less detailed data on herbaceous species. The aim of this study is to investigate the situation for Italian herbaceous landraces preserved on farms (in situ) by merging and analyzing data contained in the main databases on plant agrobiodiversity in Italy. Data were georeferenced, organized by botanic families and Italian regions, and analyzed by GIS and R. A total of 1615 herbaceous landraces were found (versus the 416 recorded in the ANR).

However, apparently there was a gap in communication towards regional and national institutions since, as mentioned in the introduction, Lombardy (the region in which the University of Milan is located) has not yet communicated any varieties to the bodies in charge of the creation of the National Register. The most complete Italian inventory of landraces can be considered the one derived from the “PGR Secure project” (www.pgrsecure.org) for which the Department of Applied Biology of the University of Perugia compiled “The First Italian Inventory of In Situ Maintained Landraces” [41]. The inventory reported data until January 2013 and accounted for over 20% of the data collected in this study.

It collects information suitable for use in performing structural and socioeconomic analysis of the agricultural sector in all the Member States. Contents and purposes have evolved over the time depending on the informative needs of the EU Commission and CAP's priorities. As a part of the Green Deal, CAP is expected to contribute to the environment, climate change and biodiversity objectives beyond 2020. In this new framework, one initiative launched inside the Farm to Fork Strategy has been the change of name from FADN to Farm Sustainability Data Network (FSDN) including variables related to the environmental and social aspects of farming. Like in other EU countries, the information collected by the Italian FADN exceeds that required by the EU regulations, allowing to some extent consideration of special characteristics of national agriculture. However, further variables could be added or changed, gathering them directly from the farmer, by including the existing database or through targeted questionnaires on FADN sub-samples. The new survey will maintain and improve the current role of FADN, reinforcing the analytical and political relevance of the network by adding further dimensions of sustainability. The discussion is on-going at EU and National level and this paper is a contribution to this debate. It gives a description of the environmental and social data gathered by the Italian FADN together with a consideration regarding about the opportunity and the possibility to enhance the system in view of the future period under evaluation. The switch to FSDN will require an effort from the Member States in terms of IT infrastructure, economic resources, new ways of collecting data and staff involved in data collection and the verification process. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting System; Data Network; Farm Sustainability; Italian Fadn; Sustainability","","","","","Andersen, Erling, Farm management indicators and farm typologies as a basis for assessments in a changing policy environment, Journal of Environmental Management, 82, 3, pp. 353-362, (2007); Bessiere, J., Local development and heritage: traditional food and cuisine as tourist attractions in rural areas, Sociologia Ruralis, 38, 1, pp. 21-34, (1998); 1 St Congress Italian Association of Agricultural Applied Economics Aieaa, (2012); Fifth International Conference on Agricultural Statistics Icas V, (2010); Notes Et Etudes Economiques, (2006); Scientific Papers Series Management Economic Engineering in Agriculture and Rural Development, (2016); A Review of Farm Level Indicators of Sustainability with A Focus on CAP and Fadn, (2014); Dillon, Emma Jane, Assessing the sustainability of Irish agriculture, International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability, 8, 3, pp. 131-147, (2010); Eizenberg, Efrat, Social sustainability: A new conceptual framework, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 1, (2017); Strategy for Agricultural Statistics for 2020 and Beyond, (2015)","","FrancoAngeli","","","","","","11261668; 19724802","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127141336"

Of particular interest are the genotypes of the most ancient regions of viticulture. The territories of the subtropical zone of Georgia and the central part of Abkhazia belong to one of the centers of origin of the cultural grapevine. The purpose of the work was to genotype native Abkhazian grape cultivars, to study their genetic diversity based on DNA profiling data and to compare them with the genotypes of local varieties of other viticultural regions. Samples of plants were taken on the territory of the Republic of Abkhazia in private farmsteads and in the collection of the agricultural firm “Vina i Vody Abkhazii“(“Wines and Waters of Abkhazia”). The genotyping of the Abkhazian cultivars Avasirhva, Agbizh, Azhapsh, Azhizhkvakva, Azhikvaca, Atvizh, Atyrkuazh, Achkykazh, Kachich was carried out using 14 DNA markers, 9 of which are standard microsatellite markers recommended for the identification of grape varieties. To improve our knowledge about the sizes of the identified alleles, we used the DNA of grape cultivars with a known allelic composition at the analyzed loci. Statistical analysis of the data showed that the observed heterozygosity for the analyzed loci exceeded expected values, which indicates a genetic polymorphism of the studied sample of varieties. Evaluation of genetic similarity within the analyzed group based on the results of genotyping at 14 loci showed that the cultivars Kachich and Azhapsh differed from the other Abkhazian varieties. The obtained DNA profiles of the Abkhazian cultivars were checked for compliance with DNA-fingerprints of grape varieties in the Vitis International Variety Catalogue. The Georgian varieties Azhizhkvakva and Tsitska turned out to be synonyms according to DNA profiles, two varieties from the Database (Italian Albana bianca and Georgian Ojaleshi) have differences in DNA-fingerprints from the varieties Atyrkuazh and Azhikvatsa only in one allele, respectively. When comparing the identified Abkhazian grape genotypes, their difference from the sample of Dagestan, Don, Greek, Turkish, Italian, Spanish, and French varieties and genetic similarity with the genotypes of Georgian grapes were shown. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic Diversity; Local Grape Varieties; Ssr-loci; Vitis Vinifera L","","","","This study was supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research and Academy of Sciences of Abkhazia within the framework of the scientific project No. 19-516-40001 Abkh_a.","Bowers, John E., Development and characterization of additional microsatellite DNA markers for grape, American Journal of Enology and Viticulture, 50, 3, pp. 243-246, (1999); Grapes of Abkhazia, (1968); Cipriani, Guido, The SSR-based molecular profile of 1005 grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) accessions uncovers new synonymy and parentages, and reveals a large admixture amongst varieties of different geographic origin, Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 121, 8, pp. 1569-1585, (2010); Crespan, Manna, The Muscats: A molecular analysis of synonyms, homonyms and genetic relationships within a large family of grapevine cultivars, Vitis - Journal of Grapevine Research, 40, 1, pp. 23-30, (2001); Di Gaspero, Gabriele, Selective sweep at the Rpv3 locus during grapevine breeding for downy mildew resistance, Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 124, 2, pp. 277-286, (2012); Earl, Dent A., STRUCTURE HARVESTER: A website and program for visualizing STRUCTURE output and implementing the Evanno method, Conservation Genetics Resources, 4, 2, pp. 359-361, (2012); Evanno, Guillaume, Detecting the number of clusters of individuals using the software STRUCTURE: A simulation study, Molecular Ecology, 14, 8, pp. 2611-2620, (2005); Fossati, Tiziana, The use of AFLP and SSR molecular markers to decipher homonyms and synonyms in grapevine cultivars: The case of the varietal group known as ""Schiave, Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 102, 2-3, pp. 200-205, (2001); Ampelography of the USSR Standard and Promising Grape Varieties, (1953); Ampelography of the USSR Standard and Promising Grape Varieties, (1954)","","Institute of Cytology and Genetics of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences","","","","","","25000462; 25003259","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122231333"

The sample is composed of 938 farms included in the 2015 FADN database and located in Alpine municipalities. They are mainly involved in dairy farming, fruit growing, viticulture and sheep and goat rearing, and half are managed by young and female entrepreneurs. There are two main results of this research: first, confirmation that diversification strategies can positively affect farm income, even for Alpine farms.

Selected bulk tank milk quality parameters (somatic cell count, total bacterial count, urea, protein and fat contents) recorded during the years 2014-2016 in 287 Italian dairy farms were compared with the animal welfare data of each farm. The welfare assessment data were extracted from the database of the Italian Reference Centre for Animal Welfare (CReNBA), which includes the outputs of the application of the CReNBA welfare assessment protocol for dairy cows, used at national level for on-farm controls. The statistical analysis was carried out using the correlation coefficient for Kendall's Tau ranks, in order to investigate the presence of a categoric relationship between the selected bulk tank milk quality parameters and the overall animal welfare score or the scores of the single areas A (farm management and staff training), B (housing) and C (animal-based measures). Somatic cell count, total bacterial count, urea and proteins demonstrated only a few statistically significant and very weak correlations with farm animal welfare data, while no significant correlations were obtained for milk fat content. Given the weak correlations found, the selected bulk tank milk parameters seems to be able to provide only limited information about the welfare level of the herd, thus it could be difficult to use them for drawing up a pre-screening model for identifying herds at risk of poor welfare. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Animal Welfare Assessment; Dairy Cow; Indicators; Milk Quality; Urea; Milk Proteins; Urea; Milk Protein; Urea; Agricultural Land; Animal; Animal Housing; Animal Welfare; Bacterial Load; Bovine; Cell Count; Chemistry; Cytology; Dairying; Female; Italy; Microbiology; Milk; Procedures; Veterinary Medicine; Animal Welfare; Animals; Bacterial Load; Cattle; Cell Count; Dairying; Farms; Female; Housing, Animal; Milk; Milk Proteins; Urea","milk protein; urea; agricultural land; animal; animal housing; animal welfare; bacterial load; bovine; cell count; chemistry; cytology; dairying; female; Italy; microbiology; milk; procedures; veterinary medicine; Animal Welfare; Animals; Bacterial Load; Cattle; Cell Count; Dairying; Farms; Female; Housing, Animal; Milk; Milk Proteins; Urea","","urea, 57-13-6; Milk Proteins; Urea","","Arnould, Valérie M.R., Review: Milk composition as management tool of sustainability, Biotechnology, Agronomy, Society and Environment, 17, 4, pp. 613-621, (2013); Bertocchi, Luigi, Preliminary observations on the relationship between animal welfare and milk somatic cells, Large Animal Review, 18, 5, pp. 259-263, (2012); Bertocchi, Luigi, Characterization of hazards, welfare promoters and animal-based measures for the welfare assessment of dairy cows: Elicitation of expert opinion, Preventive Veterinary Medicine, 150, pp. 8-18, (2018); De Vries, M., Exploring the value of routinely collected herd data for estimating dairy cattle welfare, Journal of Dairy Science, 97, 2, pp. 715-730, (2014); Dufour, Simon, Invited review: Effect of udder health management practices on herd somatic cell count, Journal of Dairy Science, 94, 2, pp. 563-579, (2011); Scientific Opinion on the use of animal-based measures to assess welfare of dairy cows, EFSA Journal, 10, 1, (2012); Hristov, S.

Therefore, an efficient ecotoxicological approach to metal contamination is the measure of bioaccumulation level in target organisms. In this work, we characterized the heavy metal bioaccumulation in honey bees, Apis mellifera ligustica, collected at 35 sites from Umbria (Central Italy). The comparison of our data with selected Italian investigations revealed metal bioaccumulation in honey bee matrix of the same order of magnitude, with Cd showing a higher variability. To generalize the results, we developed a Honeybee Contamination Index (HCI) based on metal bioaccumulation in honey bees. An application of the HCI to the present dataset revealed cases of low (sixteen sites), intermediate (eighteen sites), and high (one site) metal contaminations. The comparison of HCI values from the Umbrian dataset with values calculated for other Italian and European metadata showed that most of the Umbrian sites fell in the portion of low and intermediate contamination conditions. HCI represented a reliable tool that provided a piece of concise information on metal contamination in terrestrial environments. Parallel to this effort, we have determined, the metal concentrations in the airborne particulate matter (PM<inf>10</inf>) at three regional background-monitoring stations in Umbria. These stations are representative of the average air quality of the areas of the investigated apiaries. A comparative analysis of metal enrichment factors in PM<inf>10</inf>, and honey bees suggested that the contamination in the bees was related to the PM<inf>10</inf> values only to a minor extent. On the other side, a clear enrichment of metals such as Cd, Mn, Zn, and Cu in the honey bees appeared to depend on very local conditions and was probably related to the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the resuspension of the locally contaminated soils and agriculture residues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Airborne Particulate Matter; Apis Mellifera Ligustica; Heavy Metal Bioaccumulation; Honeybee Contamination Index; Cadmium; Copper; Manganese; Zinc; Environmental Pollutants; Metals, Heavy; Pesticides; Air Quality; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Contamination; Food Products; Heavy Metals; Particles (particulate Matter); Agriculture Residues; Airborne Particulate Matters; Apis Mellifera; Contamination Index; Metal Bioaccumulation; Metal Bioavailability; Metal Enrichment Factors; Terrestrial Environments; Soil Pollution; Cadmium; Copper; Heavy Metal; Manganese; Zinc; Pesticide; Air Quality; Assessment Method; Atmospheric Pollution; Bioaccumulation; Bioindicator; Concentration (composition); Enrichment; Honeybee; Particulate Matter; Pollution Monitoring; Terrestrial Environment; Concentration (parameter); Environmental Factor; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Nonhuman; Terrestrial Species; Animal; Bee; Metabolism; Pollutant; Procedures; Umbria; Apis Mellifera Ligustica; Apoidea; Animals; Bees; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Metals, Heavy; Pesticides","Air quality; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Contamination; Food products; Heavy metals; Particles (particulate matter); Agriculture residues; Airborne particulate matters; Apis mellifera; Contamination index; Metal bioaccumulation; Metal bioavailability; Metal enrichment factors; Terrestrial environments; Soil pollution; cadmium; copper; heavy metal; manganese; zinc; pesticide; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; bioaccumulation; bioindicator; concentration (composition); enrichment; honeybee; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; terrestrial environment; concentration (parameter); environmental factor; environmental monitoring; Italy; nonhuman; terrestrial species; animal; bee; metabolism; pollutant; procedures; Umbria; Apis mellifera ligustica; Apoidea; Animals; Bees; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Metals, Heavy; Pesticides","","cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; Environmental Pollutants; Metals, Heavy; Pesticides","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Fondazione Cassa Risparmio Perugia, project code 2016.0033.021, Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica.

The analysis of modifications occurred in rural land, as well as in mountain areas of some internal Regions - like the Basilicata Region (Southern Italy), in which the continuous abandonment of agriculture is relentlessly reshaping the landscape patterns - is crucial to understand their profound transformations, and to reconstruct their landscape original structure, so as to avoid negative impacts (e.g., loss of biodiversity, land degradation, hydrogeological instability, etc.). One of the observed connected phenomena is the continuous increase in the forest surface. In this work, data from the official Italian dataset and “Land Copernicus” program have been implemented into a GIS environment, together with some historical thematic cartographies (the 1936 Italian Kingdom Forest Map and the National Research Council Map of Land Cover 1960) and ancillary data, to evaluate the main dynamics of landscape and forest environment transformation in the last century.

A comparative analysis of the Italian data collection systems related to fatal tractor accidents in agriculture was performed focusing on tractor rollover fatalities with the aim of analyzing the accident scenario. Method: Data from the Operational Archives of the Italian Workers Compensation Authority (INAIL), which collects injuries of workers covered by compulsory accident insurance and those of the National Surveillance System (INAIL_ASL), which provides narrative text reports of work-related fatal accidents have been analyzed and compared to the information collected by the INAIL Observatory. The INAL Observatory was recently set up to complement the collection of fatal accidents involving agricultural machinery. Italian data were then compared to data available at an international level. Fatal tractor accidents vary considerably with respect to fatal accidents in agriculture, being 10.6 and 43.7% for the Operational Archives and Surveillance System, respectively. National Surveillance System records, implemented with narrative texts allowed the accident scenario to be defined. Results: 71.7% of fatal tractor-related accidents refer to non-ROPS equipped vehicles and of these, 26.5% involved machines originally mounted with a ROPS that had been removed or was inoperative in the folded-down position during the rollover event. Just one fatal event from a collapsed ROPS on the overturned tractor was recorded. It is interesting that 16.6% of fatal accidents involved a clear environmental factor. Practical application: A campaign to train tractor drivers on the correct use of the combination ROPS and seatbelt can contribute to decreasing rollover events with fatal outcomes. Contemporarily a strict requirement to install ROPS and a seatbelt on tractors, combined to an official inspection at the farm level, can increase the chance of survival in a rollover accident. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accidents Database; Fatal Accidents; Rops; Tractor Safety; Work-related Deaths; Agriculture; Data Acquisition; Driver Training; Monitoring; Observatories; Occupational Risks; Security Systems; Tractors (agricultural); Tractors (truck); Comparative Analysis; Data Collection System; Environmental Factors; Fatal Accidents; Rops; Surveillance Systems; Tractor Safety; Work-related; Accidents; Agriculture; Epidemiology; Human; Italy; Mortality; Motor Vehicle; Occupational Accident; Seatbelt; Traffic Accident; Accidents, Occupational; Accidents, Traffic; Humans; Motor Vehicles; Seat Belts","Agriculture; Data acquisition; Driver training; Monitoring; Observatories; Occupational risks; Security systems; Tractors (agricultural); Tractors (truck); Comparative analysis; Data collection system; Environmental factors; Fatal accidents; ROPS; Surveillance systems; Tractor safety; Work-related; Accidents; agriculture; epidemiology; human; Italy; mortality; motor vehicle; occupational accident; seatbelt; traffic accident; Accidents, Occupational; Accidents, Traffic; Humans; Motor Vehicles; Seat Belts","","","","Arana, Ignacio, Evaluation of risk factors in fatal accidents in agriculture, Spanish Journal of Agricultural Research, 8, 3, pp. 592-598, (2010); Arndt, James F., Roll-over protective structures for farm and construction tractors - A 50-year review, SAE Technical Papers, (1971); Browning, Steven R., Farm tractor safety in Kentucky, 1995, Public Health Reports, 114, 1, pp. 53-59, (1999); Bunn, Terry Lee, Narrative text analysis of Kentucky tractor fatality reports, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 40, 2, pp. 419-425, (2008); J Agromedicine, (2014); Record of Tractor Related Injury and Death Meeting, (2003); Day, Lesley M., Farm work related fatalities among adults in Victoria, Australia the human cost of agriculture, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 31, 1-2, pp. 153-159, (1999); Day, Lesley M., An Australian experience with tractor rollover protective structure rebate programs: Process, impact and outcome evaluation, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 36, 5, pp. 861-867, (2004); Degroot, J.

The empirical analysis is based on the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) dataset. The data were stratified by altimetry zone and farm size. Descriptive statistics and the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for each group were used. The main results show how the Second Pillar has mainly supported small and medium-sized farms with tourism activities and located in disadvantaged areas.

The model was calibrated and validated in a previous modelling study using long-term weather data from the same experimental sites and agronomic data-sets of the same sites and varieties over the period 1973–2004. To assess the responses of durum wheat varieties to climate changes, 48 synthetic climates based on the combination of increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall were used to represent paths of possible future climate change. The simulated impacts of climate projections on durum wheat varieties at both sites were: grain yield reduction, slightly increasing kernel weight, and earlier anthesis dates. The late variety Creso showed a larger grain yield reduction compared to the early genotypes Duilio and Simeto. Anticipation of time to flowering was larger at Ussana (medium-low fertility soil) than at Benatzu (high fertility soil) with no differences between varieties. Earlier anthesis response was due to temperature increase rather than rainfall reduction, since in the CERES-Wheat model as well as in the majority of crop growth models water availability has no effect on crop development rate. Predictions for kernel weight were more uncertain with a slightly increasing trend in response to increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall. The CERES-Wheat crop model seems to capture fairly well the greater resilience shown by early genotypes in Mediterranean rainfed conditions. In general, the CERES-Wheat model showed results in line with the findings from real experiments in different pedoclimatic conditions. For these reasons, CERES-Wheat appeared to be reliable when used to evaluate plant responses to projected climate change conditions and can represent a useful tool for developing adaptation strategies and measures such as the choice and selection of adapted genotypes to tackle the negative impact of climate change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceres-wheat; Climate Change; Crop Modelling; Durum Wheat; Mediterranean Climate; Agricultural Modeling; Agrometeorology; Climate Change; Crop Yield; Genotype; Growth Modeling; Mediterranean Environment; Phenology; Wheat; Italy; Sardinia; Triticum Aestivum; Triticum Turgidum Subsp.

However, since agriculture is an economic activity, its permanence implies that it should be able to generate a satisfactory income for farmers. Where this is not possible, due to natural constraints or adverse economic and market conditions, in order to maintain an adequate use of farmland it is necessary to provide public aid to farmers. In this framework, the design of proper interventions aimed to promote rural development in less favoured areas should be based on a deep knowledge at the farm and territorial level. As regards the territorial level, the RDP zoning [art. 11 Reg. Ce 1698/2005] developed by Member States on the base of the guidelines provided by the European Commission is very often not sufficient to adequately define the territorial characteristics of rural areas. The use of GIS techniques may help to handle this issue by providing a better and more detailed knowledge at the territorial level. Farm level is important insofar as aid effectiveness is usually strongly depending on the type of farm that is receiving it. Thus, a careful selection of beneficiaries could determine a more effective and efficient distribution of resources. This paper aims to provide a spatial analysis of natural constraints and types of farming style in Mugello area and to analyse their relations with CAP aid distribution. Both Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and Rural Development Programme (RDP) payments have been taken into account. The paper combines a GIS analysis of terrain features with the theoretical approach of farming styles. For this purpose, the study integrates several sources of data: the 2010 Italian Agriculture Census, the Tuscany Regional Agency for Payments in Agriculture (ARTEA) database, and land cover data from the database Corine Land Cover (CLC-06), as updated to 2007 by LAMMA (Laboratory for Environment Monitoring and Modelling). A geo-referenced database including socioeconomic attributes of farms, land use, and terrain characteristics has been generated in order to merge information at territorial and farm level. The results of this integrated analysis confirm that Mugello is a very heterogeneous area as regards terrain characteristics despite the fact that it is totally included in less favoured areas. On the other side, farm strategies and economic results seem to be related to entrepreneurial characteristics as much as to natural constraints. The analysis of Pillar I payments and RDP payments for farms located in this mountainous area shows a very complex situation where the strategies implemented by farmers of the strongest farming styles may successfully counteract natural constraints. Besides, in the Authors' opinion, the analyses performed highlight the importance of spatial analysis as a tool for evaluating how public resources are distributed on a territory, thus providing also useful information on the way this distribution could be improved, e.g. for ensuring a higher level of environmental services. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Common Agricultural Policies; Disadvantaged Rural Areas; Farming Styles; Integrated Gis Database; Multi-criteria Analysis","","","","","Le Politiche Di Sviluppo Rurale Fra Retorica E Pratica Una Lettura Di Leader in Chiave Di Innovazione Sociale, (2016); Ballas, Dimitris, Building a dynamic spatial microsimulation model for Ireland, Population, Space and Place, 11, 3, pp. 157-172, (2005); Bartolini, Fabio, Explaining determinants of the on-farm diversification: Empirical evidence from Tuscany region, Bio-based and Applied Economics, 3, 2, pp. 137-157, (2014); Bartolini, Fabio, Understanding linkages between common agricultural policy and High Nature Value (HNV) farmland provision: an empirical analysis in Tuscany Region, Agricultural and Food Economics, 2, 1, (2014); Beaudeau, François, Relationships between culling criteria in dairy herds and farmers' management styles, Preventive Veterinary Medicine, 25, 3-4, pp. 327-342, (1996); Guidelines for Application of Common Criteria to Identify Agricultural Areas with Natural Handicaps, (2009); Brady, Mark Vincent, An agent-based approach to modeling impacts of agricultural policy on land use, biodiversity and ecosystem services, Landscape Ecology, 27, 9, pp. 1363-1381, (2012); Budić, I.

It is therefore interesting to understand which production practices better react to these characteristics. Biodynamic appears to respond well in terms of environmental sustainability: can the same be affirmed in terms of economic sustainability? In this paper Italian biodynamic sector has been analyzed focusing on horticultural production: its economic sustainability has been verified especially for small farms that are facing increasing problems in terms of profitability. The Italian Demeter database was used to identify biodynamic farms that have been georeferenced at a national level and then only the ones specialized in vegetable production have been selected for Italy. In order to assess its economic sustainability the production costs for three farms located in the area of the High Po valley that are converting from organic to biodynamic have been examined, focusing on five items: lettuce (Lactuca sativa), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), zucchini (Cucurbita pepo), eggplant (Solanum melongena), cucumber (Cucumis sativus). Then these costs have been compared to the ones associated with organic and traditional methods. Their prices have been also compared in order to achieve an economic assessment of the different production methods. Finally a SWOT analysis regarding the adoption of the biodynamic method has been performed. This paper proves that the biodynamic method is economically sustainable in the horticultural production based on higher retail prices that-for some products-compensate higher costs, in comparison to the organic and traditional methods. Another factor that strengthens the use of the biodynamic method is a favorable European legislation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biodynamic Agriculture; Economic Profitability; Farm Strategies; Productive Methods; Supply Chains","","","","","Brown, Elizabeth, Motivations of consumers that use local, organic fruit and vegetable box schemes in Central England and Southern France, Appetite, 53, 2, pp. 183-188, (2009); Rapporto Di Ricerca Dipartimento Di Economia Dell Universita Di Torino, (2009); CAP Towards 2020 Meeting the Food Natural Resources and Territorial Challenges of the Future, (2010); Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture, (2011); Paper Presented at International Scientific Conference Rural Development, (2013); Foley, Jonathan A., Solutions for a cultivated planet, Nature, 478, 7369, pp. 337-342, (2011); Frisio, Dario G., Coopetition: A strategic model for horticultural sector? the case of Lombardy Region, Acta Horticulturae, 960, pp. 247-254, (2012); Green Revolution Curse or Blessing, (2002); Hjelmar, Ulf, Consumers' purchase of organic food products.

Six phenological phases were reproduced daily according to the BBCH codes (00-89): emergence (00-09), leaf development (10-19), stem elongation (30-39), inflorescence emergence (50-59), flowering (60-69) and pod development-maturation period (70-89). The model takes into account temperature (including vernalisation) and photoperiod as the main environmental forces affecting crop phenology. The macro stages of leaf development and shooting were reproduced considering the rates of leaf appearance and internode extension. Model calibration and validation were performed using an extensive database of phenological observations collected from several experimental sites across France (n≤144), Germany (n≤839) and Italy (n≤577). The stability of the parameterisation was checked by a cross-calibration procedure. Applied to the independent datasets used for validation and cross-validation, the model was able to predict the whole-crop cycle with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.8 and 3.2 BBCH stages, respectively. Particularly accurate predictions of winter OSR development were obtained with the Italian datasets (RMSE: 2.1 and 2.3 BBCH stages for validation and cross-validation, respectively). Considering the phenological phases separately, emergence, leaf development, flowering and the pod development-maturation period were simulated with RMSE of 1.0, 2.4, 2.9 and 3.2 BBCH stages, respectively (validation datasets). Slightly higher uncertainty emerged in the prediction of stem elongation and inflorescence emergence phases (RMSE: 3.5 and 4.1 BBCH stages, validation datasets). The model reproduced winter OSR development with a sufficient degree of accuracy for a wide range of years, locations, sowing dates and genotypes, resulting in an efficient and widely applicable prediction tool with relevant practical purposes in the crop management scheduling. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Simulation Model.; Agricultural Management; Cultivar; Database; Emergence; Empirical Analysis; Environmental Effect; Growth Modeling; Model Validation; Numerical Model; Ontogeny; Parameterization; Phenology; Photoperiod; Simulation; Winter; France; Germany; Italy; Brassica Napus","agricultural management; cultivar; database; emergence; empirical analysis; environmental effect; growth modeling; model validation; numerical model; ontogeny; parameterization; phenology; photoperiod; simulation; winter; France; Germany; Italy; Brassica napus","","","","Diepenbrock, Wulf A., Yield analysis of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.): A review, Field Crops Research, 67, 1, pp. 35-49, (2000); Gabrielle, Benoît, Development and evaluation of a CERES-type model for winter oilseed rape, Field Crops Research, 57, 1, pp. 95-111, (1998); Gayler, Sebastian, Modeling biomass growth, N-uptake and phenological development of potato crop, Geoderma, 105, 3-4, pp. 367-383, (2002); Gomez, Nora V., Factors that modify early and late reproductive phases in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.): Its impact on seed yield and oil content, Industrial Crops and Products, 34, 2, pp. 1277-1285, (2011); Crop Sci, (1993); Habekotté, Berend, A model of the phenological development of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), Field Crops Research, 54, 2-3, pp. 127-136, (1997); Hodgson, A.

In Italy, agritourism is considered an agricultural activity and can only be performed by a farmer. Moreover, Italian national legislation forces the farmer to dedicate himself mainly to traditional farming, rather than to tourism activities. For this reason, environmental performances have been highlighted by analyzing only features and production systems of the farms. By utilizing the most frequent indicators used in studies regarding sustainability, the authors show how Italian agritourisms tend to develop more environmentally friendly agricultural methods, which have a positive impact on biodiversity, landscape and natural resources. The empirical analysis is based on the Italian FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) dataset. The European FADN was created to represent farms’ technical and economic operation in the European Union and on which it drafts the agricultural and rural policies. The dichotomous structure of the dependent variable (presence or absence of agritourism at the farm) has a propensity for an assessment method based on Binary Response Model Regression. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agritourism; Environmental Performances; Farm; Italy","","","","","Abler, David G., Multifunctionality, agricultural policy, and environmental policy, Agricultural and Resource Economics Review, 33, 1, pp. 8-17, (2004); Post Fordism A Reader, (1994); Barbieri, Carla E., Assessing the sustainability of agritourism in the US: A comparison between agritourism and other farm entrepreneurial ventures, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 21, 2, pp. 252-270, (2013); Agriregionieuropa, (2010); Cawley, Mary E., Integrated rural tourism:.

After the evaluation of the importance of irrigation investments for the competitiveness of Italian agriculture, the report contains an overview of the impacts of climate change in agriculture and of the economic models to estimate such impact; than it reports an econometric analysis to estimate the role of irrigation for Italian agriculture. Data used came from the database FADN. They refer to observations at farms level for the period 1990-2010. The main results of the econometric analysis are that irrigation of fruit and vegetable crops is particularly relevant to the northeast of the country (with an increase in income estimated in the order of 14%), and, the relevance of the irrigation of arable crops is related to the whole country (even if the most important impact has been observed for the south of Italy and the islands where we observed an increase in income of about 12%). In the second part the paper analyzes irrigation management in the different river basin districts. The analysis, made by OTE, shows a different degree of efficiency of irrigation in relation to the main characteristics of crops areas: in the Padano district and in the district of Alpi Orientali, with reference to cereals and fruit, irrigation management seems to be characterized by a lower level of efficiency; same situation is presented in the district of Sicily with refers to the cultivation of cereals. A higher degree of efficiency and virtuous behaviors emerge with refer- ence to horticulture, floriculture and fruit in the districts Appenino Meridionale and Appennino e Settentrionale. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Irrigation Investments; River Basin Districts; Rural Development Programming; Water Management; Water Resource For Agriculture","","","","","Deressa, Temesgen Tadesse, Economic impact of climate change on crop production in ethiopia: Evidence from cross-section measures, Journal of African Economies, 18, 4, pp. 529-554, (2009); Deschênes, Olivier, The economic impacts of climate change: Evidence from agricultural output and random fluctuations in weather, American Economic Review, 97, 1, pp. 354-385, (2007); Deschênes, Olivier, Climate change, mortality, and adaptation: Evidence from annual fluctuations in weather in the US, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 3, 4, pp. 152-185, (2011); Rainfall Shocks Resilience and the Dynamic Effects of Crop Biodiversity on the Productivity of the Agro Ecosystem, (2008); Di Falco, Salvatore, On crop biodiversity, risk exposure, and food security in the highlands of Ethiopia, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 91, 3, pp. 599-611, (2009); Di Falco, Salvatore, Does adaptation to climate change provide food security?
